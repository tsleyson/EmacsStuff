Thoughts on Toradora, composed May 11th, 2011, several weeks after purchasing the first volume of the manga:

Toradora was a series I'd been hearing about for a while, but hadn't ever cared much about, since it had been talked up by the Anime News Network people whose opinions I go out of my way to ignore. But the series kept popping up on Amazon in connection with several other series I enjoyed, like K-On and Aria, so I figured I'd give it a chance.

Ryuuji Takasu is a high school student who has trouble making friends, since his evil, squinty eyes make people think he's a delinquent (I have theories about the real reason for this, below). He lives with his mother, who works at the local hostess bar, and does all the housework while she sleeps all day. But Ryuuji does have a few friends, one of whom is Kitamura, the class representative and captain of the boys' softball team. Kitamura's female counterpart, Minori Kushieda, is the secret object of Takasu's affections. One day he has a run-in with Taiga Aisaka, a short, foul-tempered girl who's known as "The Palmtop Tiger" because of her height and ill temper. After school, he catches Taiga putting something in his bag; he goes home and discovers that it's a love letter for Kitamura, which Taiga had put in his bag by mistake since he left it on Kitamura's desk. Taiga sneaks into his house later that night to retrieve the letter, and Ryuuji reveals that the envelope was empty; she forgot to put in the letter. In order to gain her trust, Ryuuji shows her the love letters, poems, and mix-CDs that he made to someday give to Kushieda, who is Taiga's best friend. Taiga and Ryuuji decide to unite and help each other, since each is in love with the other's best friend.

I've seen Toradora compared with OreImo, and I think it's a fair comparison, though a subtle one. The content and situation are in no way similar, but both shows excel in creating well-drawn, realistic characters with lots of little touches that lend them veracity. For example, the first scene of the manga shows Ryuuji trying to make his bangs fluffy, in mimicry of the stylish look he reads about in a magazine, hoping the new look will help him look less like a delinquent and make it easier to find friends. Even though he looks angry, he's actually a romantic, which makes it feel like he exists in the real world where appearances can be deceiving. Similarly, Taiga appears small and cute, but is actually cruel and selfish. This sort of betrayal of the viewer's expectations is reminiscent of what OreImo did with characters like Ayase, who seemed benign but turned out to be vicious, or Kuroneko, who seemed like a tortured suburban teen but turned out to be down-to-earth and domestic-minded. And of course, both series have a small, cute, angry, cruel tsundere as a female lead.

Another similarity between the two is the depth and robustness of the world they create. Unlike many anime leads, who grow up in good families with parents who work comfortable office jobs, Takasu leads a lower-class sort of life: his mother works at a somewhat shady job for little money, his dead father was apparently a bosozoku, and he spends most of his free time doing housework and making meals. This, I think, is the real reason for Takasu's perception by his classmates as a delinquent; since Japan is still a rather class-based society, Takasu's comfortable suburban classmates would probably feel uncomfortable around someone with such a family background, and might prejudge him. As yet, we don't know a lot about Taiga other than that her family apparently has money, but when we do find out about her, I don't expect to get a generic sort of backstory, and I definitely don't expect the rumor that her family runs a yakuza cell to be true; I expect to see a plausible explanation for why she lives on her own in her massive condo, eating convenience store food.

So far we've gone through some pretty typical romantic comedy-style plotlines, but the two lead characters and the verisimilitude of the world make it a lot more fun to follow than it should be. Toradora creates a world and characters that hold up to different situations well, and I'll probably have more to say about it as new volumes come out.

Thoughts on Volumes 2 and 3, written Saturday, December 24th, 2011:

Volume 2 actually came out quite a while ago, but it didn't really enthrall me like Volume 1 did, so I never felt spurred to write about it. But I just read Volume 3 and enjoyed it, so I'm back into this series and willing to cover Volume 2 a bit.

When I look back, I think I found Volume 2 underwhelming not because it actually was, but because at the time I was totally absorbed by K-On, and the content from Volume 2 is mostly dramatic and not humorous, so not comparable to K-On. I also felt wary, because this volume seemed to advance a lot towards Ryuuji and Taiga becoming a couple. On the one hand, I want Ryuuji and Taiga to advance towards becoming a couple because I hate Takahashi romances; Ranma and Akane or Inuyasha and Kagome dragging their idiotic grade school antics on for hundreds of episodes makes me want to vomit. (I really hate Rumiko Takahashi.) On the other hand, it can't happen too quickly. Volume 2 felt like it was moving towards it too quickly.

There are two major plot arcs in Volume 2. The first picks up from the end of Volume 1 and reveals that Kitamura and Kushieda both think Taiga and Ryuuji are dating and want to congratulate them. Of course, this is terrible, since Taiga is in love with Kitamura and Ryuuji is in love with Kushieda. They spend a lot of time being depressed together, including one very funny scene where they decide to take out their frustrations on a telephone pole and Taiga hurts herself. We also get a hint during this period about why Taiga lives alone: she fought with her family and said something about wanting to live on her own, so they rented her an apartment and kicked her out. Finally, Taiga goes on a rampage trying to convince Kushieda that she's not dating Ryuuji, then calls Kitamura out behind the school to confess her love. By coincidence, she chooses to confess right underneath the window of the men's bathroom right when Ryuuji is in the bathroom. He sees her and ends up hearing her confession, which goes badly wrong because while explaining that she's not dating Ryuuji, she equivocates and ends up telling Kitamura all the things she likes about Ryuuji. Kitamura reveals that he confessed his love to her a year ago and was turned down, saying it's ironic that she now came to confess to him. He then tells her that she and Ryuuji make a good couple, and says he's glad to know she likes him and is sure they'll become good friends.

When Takasu hears this, he seems to think that Kitamura just mistook the meaning of Taiga's words to mean she liked him in a friendly way. That's not how it looked to me. It looked to me like he understood very well what Taiga was saying, but essentially told her she was too good with Ryuuji for him to possibly get in the way of them, and that he only wanted to be friends with her. However, Ryuuji and Taiga both misunderstand and decide to continue their plotting to get closer to Kushieda and Kitamura.

In the second major plot arc, Kitamura's childhood friend, Ami Kawashima, comes to visit him for the summer. Kawashima is a famous model and acts like a cutesy ditz in public, but is actually horrible, selfish, and cruel. Kitamura engineers a confrontation between Taiga and Ami in a restaurant, with himself and Ryuuji watching from around the corner. He tells Ryuuji he wants to convince Ami to start exposing her true personality in public, since he doesn't dislike it and thinks it would be better not to hide it. Takasu quite rightly thinks that the word "better" doesn't apply to that situation. The debacle ends with Taiga, who actually managed to control herself fairly well while Ami insulted her and ordered her around, slapping Ami across the face, then claiming it was only because there was a fly on her cheek. 

Of course, it wouldn't be manga if Ami didn't end up transferring to their school, and she's in the same class as everyone else. Volume 2 ends with her trying to get close to Ryuuji. In the restaurant, she threatened Taiga with stealing him, thinking he was Taiga's boyfriend, and now she's trying to make good on that threat. 

Volume 3 follows the Ami story arc all the way along, and although Volume 2 wasn't as bad as I originally thought, Volume 3 is much better. Ami embeds herself at the school, making friends with everyone using her fake personality, while Kitamura continues his plot to make her crack and reveal her true personality by forcing her and Taiga to coexist in one place. Taiga fights back against Ami's claims that she has no friends except Ryuuji and everyone hates her by bringing in Kushieda, who takes offense at Ami's claims that she can eat as much as she wants and never gain weight. (As Ryuuji points out, Kushieda is the girl who made a bucket full of pudding, and Taiga is constantly chowing down at his house, so their difficulty losing weight probably has nothing to do with the general difficulty of losing weight.) Taiga is in a good mood, and her mood only improves when they run into Kawashima on the way home. Kawashima is running from a creepy fan who's following her and taking her picture. When Kawashima asks if she can stay with one of them, Ryuuji presents her with two choices: she can stay in a broken down, old wooden building, or in a high-tech condo. Kawashima chooses the condo and then is horrified to discover that this means staying with Taiga. Taiga claims she is declaring a temporary truce to help out Kawashima, but the next day, it turns out that Taiga made her dance, sing, and do impressions of all 150 original Pokemon in order, on pain of being thrown outside with the stalker. She also filmed all of it so she could blackmail Kawashima forever. This comes in handy when Kitamura asks Taiga to invite Kawashima to lunch; Taiga can't refuse because she wants to stay in Kitamura's good graces, so when Kawashima won't capitulate, Taiga reminds her that video of her doing an impression of Pikachu coughing up a hairball is inside Taiga's video camera, just waiting to escape to the world. 

The lunch goes slightly better than one might expect, and then the chapter transitions to a huge litter cleanup event which Taiga is attending because Kitamura is putting it on in his capacity as a student council member, and Taiga wants to make a good impression on him. She dragged Ryuuji along because she didn't want to go alone. Kushieda and Kawashima are also present. Kushieda tells Ryuuji that Kawashima and Taiga seem to get touchy around each other and she gets the feeling Kawashima isn't like she first appears. Taiga appears, crying because she can't get Kitamura alone since he's spending all his time with the student council president, who opened the event by telling everyone that "This. Is. SPAAAARTA!!!". Kawashima hints later that the student council president is the girl Kitamura has a crush on. Kushieda and Taiga run off by themselves, leaving Kawashima and Ryuuji together. Kawashima continues acting cutesy and trying to make Ryuuji like her, but throws a fit after she steps in a dirty puddle and gets tadpoles in her shoes. She tries to brush it off, but Ryuuji finally asks why she's doing all this to try and get him to like her. They then see the creepy guy who Kawashima was hiding from earlier, and Kawashima tells Ryuuji that he's a stalker, and that she quit modeling and transferred to their school trying to get away from him. Kushieda and Taiga return trying to find them, and the stalker chases down Taiga and asks if he can take pictures of her. He starts taking them without waiting for permission, and Taiga predictably gets pissed and kicks his camera out of his hand, and tells him he's creepy. Kawashima is taken aback, since she left her home and quit her job to escape from this person who Taiga so easily told off, and inspired by Taiga, runs up to him, stomps on his camera, and tells him she wants to feed his carcass to buzzards. She looks very much like something Kouta Hirano drew while doing this. The stalker says she's not his Ami-chan and Kawashima goes fake again and says she's so cute, no one cares what she's really like anyway.

Taiga leaves after that, saying Kawashima did well, and Kawashima breaks down from the fear she felt while telling off the stalker, so Ryuuji brings her to his house and makes her milk and honey. Kawashima admits that she was trying to steal Ryuuji from Taiga and that it didn't work. She says she was jealous of Taiga because Taiga still has good friends like Ryuuji and Minori even though she has a terrible personality, and says since Ryuuji has figured out her true personality, there's no reason to hide it from him anymore. She asks if he would come to like her if she revealed her true personality, while crawling up on him. Of course, his mother and Taiga come back from shopping right then and see them. Taiga pretends not to be mad, then can't pretend anymore and leaves in the middle of dinner, and the volume ends.

Volume 2 dragged in some places pretty badly, but Volume 3 was very well-constructed. Taiga isn't a tsundere like Ore Imo's Kirino, who has the right mixture of cute moments and motives for her anger that makes her not seem unreasonable. She has enough cute moments to get by, but she's much more haughty and prickly than Kirino in general, so she's occasionally a drag to read about. But the series generally does a good job managing her, and Kawashima was an excellent management tool. Compared with Kawashima, who is genuinely horrible and also deceptive, Taiga seems hard to deal with but not nearly as hard to like. Kawashima also brought out some of Taiga's cute side, especially at the beginning of the volume when she tells Taiga that everyone hates her, that her only friend is Ryuuji, who doesn't seem to really like her either, that all the teachers hate her, and that even Kitamura, the most forgiving person around, probably hates her. (The teachers probably do hate her, with all the times she's smashed up the classroom.) Ryuuji finds her later curled up in bed crying, in a fit of self-loathing because she's short and has a weird name, and has to reassure her that he and Kitamura saw everything that happened in the restaurant, so it doesn't matter what lie Kawashima told Kitamura. She was also cute later when she's in a good mood because she and Kushieda got back at Kawashima for that. Taiga is adorable with her hair tied up, so I liked the garbage pickup event where she has her hair in a ponytail; later, when it starts raining, she wears a garbage bag and a takoyaki carton on her head to keep the rain off. Only in manga could that ensemble look cute, and it does, with her adorable ponytail. 

The story in this volume moves along very nicely and keeps light and fun most of the way through, even when things get a little dramatic. It also had some great comedy moments, just as Volume 1 did. My favorites were when Taiga made Kawashima perform for her and during the lunch, when Taiga is sitting between Kitamura and Kawashima and can't decide whether to smile or scowl, so she ends up scowling with half of her face and smiling with the other half. The resultant expression is horrible. I didn't think funny expressions could amuse me anymore, but Toradora does a good job with them, and the artist is willing to make cute girls look awful for comedy, so it works. (Kawashima's Integra Hellsing face during the stalker confrontation was pretty amusing too.)

I'd like to watch the anime too, if it were available outside of seventy dollar specialty packs. It seems Toradora was originally a novel series (isn't every good anime these days based on a novel series?).

Thoughts on Volumes 4 and 5, written Friday, September 7th, 2012:

I actually bought Volume 4 a while ago when it came out, but I never wrote about it because it wasn't really that good. I got Volume 5 a few days ago and was spurred to write about it.

Volume 4 continues the Taiga / Ami feud from Volume 3. Now that Ami knows that Ryuuji has seen her real personality, she's stepped up the cutesy act even more and seems more determined than ever to win him. Kitamura stays totally uninvolved even though it's all his fault for unleashing Ami on the school. Minori gets sick of Ami and Taiga fighting and declares that their feud must be decided in a civilized manner with sports. Since the incident that touched off the recent bout of fighting involved the discovery that Taiga can't swim, Ami chooses to compete in swimming. Taiga chooses "vale tudo", which I (like Ryuuji) have never heard of, but Minori refuses that, presumably on the grounds that no one has ever heard of it, and chooses swimming. (Minori knows that Taiga and Ami don't get along and that Ami isn't as nice as she appears, but she must not understand the depth of the dislike, or else she's just being insensitive, since she goes along with swimming even knowing that Taiga can't do it.) The prize is Ryuuji; if Ami wins, she plans to drag him off to her vacation home.

Taiga receives swimming lessons from Ryuuji, beginning with putting her face in the water; she gets to a point where she's fairly fast as long as she has an innertube and a kickboard. She tries to use dirty tricks to win, like pulling off Ami's bikini top and unleashing a horde of amorous male high school students, but ends up going back to pull out a drowning Ryuuji, allowing Ami to win. When other people try to help her pull Ryuuji out, she screams that Ryuuji is hers and no one else can have him.

Since Taiga lost, Ami plots to drag Ryuuji to her vacation home, but Taiga counter-plots to come as well, and Kitamura and Minori also end up coming along. Volume 4 ends with everyone arriving and Taiga and Ryuuji plotting to scare Minori, who's revealed that she's not good with the supernatural, so that Ryuuji can "protect" her and thereby get closer to her. This continues into Volume 5.

* Thoughts on Volumes 5 and 6, <2014-03-01 Sat>

Volume 5 was okay, but a lot of it felt filler-ish, so I didn't end up writing about it. Toradora doesn't do filler nearly as well as some other series—for example, K-On is nothing but filler, and Haganai also does a good job with amusing filler. Akamatsu works are also good at doing filler. Toradora isn't like those. So when it does filler, the quality tends to suffer.
