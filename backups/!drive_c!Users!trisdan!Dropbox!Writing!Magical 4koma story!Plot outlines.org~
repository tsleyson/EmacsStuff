* Book 1
** When will I make a friend? By Nora: 
Nora describes how she enrolled at the academy and was afraid of going to a boarding school and being away from her family, but was comforted when her older sister told her about all the great new friends she would make. On the first day of class, Nora screws up her self-introduction by rambling about ham and saying her favorite book is Lyrical Ballads, by William Wordsworth. Since she's a weirdo and stutters, no one wants to be friends with her. Whenever they have to work in groups, she gets assigned to a group, but she can't speak up enough to help with the work.

Nora tries to make friends. First she tries impressing everyone with her skill at sports, but she's actually clumsy and trips on a banana peel that's inexplicably on the field and gets hurt, then ends up getting Ryan, the best player on the other team, assigned to take her to the nurse's office by the PE teacher. Next her classmates, figuring she's smart, invite her to a study group with them to finish homework. But she's too shy to speak up, and when someone asks her for help, it turns out it's all math and she doesn't know the answer.

Nora buys cookies from town and leaves them on the teacher's desk with a sign to take one, hoping it will get people to have a better opinion of her. But when she hears people asking who left them, she's too shy to speak up, especially when someone suggests that they might be poisoned. Miss Hanover, the teacher, ends up taking them and gives them back to her after school, saying she knows Nora was just trying to be friendly and encouraging her not to give up and to pick someone in class who seems nice and try to make friends with them.

Nora decides that she's okay if she only has one friend and she's going to be scientific about picking who it is. She decides on Cora. After all, their names rhyme. And Cora is a cat girl, and Nora likes cats. Plus, Cora wears glasses, so she must be smart and nice. It turns out Cora isn't smart and nice. In fact, she looks down on Nora for reading too much (it makes her head hurt to read), having no friends and for always having to work with the teacher whenever they all pair up. She calls Nora a teacher's pet and scum of the earth and insults her for not knowing her Gift yet (even though lots of people in the elementary school are like that). She also calls Nora stupid for thinking that people with glasses are smart and says she's just blind.

Miss Hanover comes to her after class and asks for a favor: that Nora go to the garden and pick some flowers to put in the classroom. Nora goes and finds herself in a strange corner of the garden with many unusual plants, like the strawberry sunflower, the bursting tomatoes, and the peppy mint. As she is looking for some flowers the bursting tomatoes burst and spray juice all over her, making her scream. Another girl comes up and apologizes, and when Nora won't stop crying she gives her some peppy mint tea to make her feel better. The peppy mint perks Nora up and gives her a sudden burst of courage, and she asks the girl to be her friend. The girl says she will, and introduces herself as Lily.

** My friend Lily. By Nora: 
Nora discovers that Lily has her own club, the Helping Hands Club. Its mission is to help others with any problem they might have. Nora says she could have used their services to find friends, and Lily says that's over now that they're friends. She asks if Nora wants to join and Nora says she does.

Lily explains that she has the Gift of Gardening, which allows her to understand what plants want and also to breed and care for unusual plants like the ones in her secret corner of the garden. She asks what Nora's gift is and Nora says she doesn't know; Lily says that's okay, it's kind of fun like that too, like waiting for Christmas.

Cora comes in looking for Lily and is unhappy to find Nora there. (Nora hides behind the curtains when Cora comes in, and Cora gets mad at her because she can still see her.) She brought cake and hot chocolate for Lily and is unhappy when Lily wants to share it with Nora. When Lily explains that Nora is her friend now, Cora is unhappy and grudgingly says she'll put up with Nora.

Lily goes to get some cups and plates for them to eat cake and drink hot chocolate and Cora makes it clear that she's only doing this to get closer to Lily, but then says she really does feel sorry for all the mean things she said to Nora the other day. Nora says she thought Cora was angry about the soccer game incident, and Cora says it was obvious that Nora just slipped on something and didn't do it on purpose, and anyway Cora wins so much that she doesn't even care if she loses one stupid PE soccer game. Nora asks how she and Lily met and Cora says two years ago, when Lily was still in the elementary school, she was in trouble once because she threw a fit and tossed a book through the window. She ran out of the classroom and accidentally bowled over Lily, who heard her out and went with her back to the classroom to sincerely apologize to the teacher, who overlooked it just that time. Ever since then she's thought Lily was great, and wanted to become better friends.

Lily comes back with cups and plates and the three of them eat cake together, and Nora comments about the nice warm feeling she gets from it. Cora says that's just her baked brain.

** My rival. By Cora:
Cora, Lily, and Nora help the PE teacher clear out a shed that's been taken over by hornets. Some of the balls even have hornets living in them. Nora gets chased around by the hornets and Cora runs for the hose and sprays them off of her, and then manages to get the ball inside a mesh bag. With the ball contained, Cora figures it's safe and puts it in the corner of another shed to be dealt with later by a teacher, and they lock up the hornet-infested shed.

As they're leaving, Cora's rival, Ranta, comes up to taunt her by rubbing it in her face that she got a better mile run time than Cora. Lily tells Cora not to let it bother her since Ranta has the Gift of Running, but Cora says because of the gift, the run doesn't count and they have to do something else. Cora bets Ranta she can't score one goal against her at soccer, and Ranta takes on that challenge. They set the time of the duel for two days hence at dawn.

Cora goes to look for Nora in the library after class one day. She finds Nora hanging out with Ranta and the two of them discussing books, which Ranta also likes. Cora takes Nora aside and tells her she wants Nora to prepare the ball for the event and to make sure the ball is flat so that when Ranta kicks it there will be too much give and it won't have any strength. Nora says she doesn't feel good about cheating and Cora doesn't care and tells Nora about her rivalry with Ranta; Ranta has always thought she was so great because of her gift and because she's rich, and Cora doesn't like it. She tells Nora not to tell Lily because Lily is too good a person and would stop her.

On the day of the match, Nora brings the ball, but Cora, with her keen hearing, is able to detect the buzzing. She tries to warn Ranta, but it's too late, and Ranta kicks it, releasing a swarm of hornets. All three of them run away and jump in the pool with their clothes on, waiting out the swarm; Nora can't swim and almost drowns, but Ranta saves her. Cora admits that Ranta did pretty well, but adds that she got a 38 on her last test, shaming Ranta, who got a 12.

** Dogs don't like me! By Nora: 
One day Nora comes to the clubroom and no one is there. As she's waiting around for Lily, Jane from the elementary school student council comes in and says they need help with something and drags Nora off to deal with it before Nora can say anything. 

Jane brings Nora to an alleyway in one of the courtyards where a stray dog has taken up residence. The dog keeps on dumping over the trash cans and creating a nuisance. The student council tried to chase the dog away, but it hid in the alley and wouldn't come out. They need Nora to get the dog out so they can throw it out of the courtyard. Nora comes to the mouth of the alley, but the dog barks and scares her. She runs away, but steels her courage to come back, only for the dog to bark and scare her again. 

Cora happens to pass by and sees Nora running up to and away from the alley. She asks Nora what she's doing and Nora explains. Exasperated, Cora goes into the alley and the dog likes her and licks her hand. Nora asks if Cora likes dogs and Cora says no, she hates them, pointing out that she's a cat. Whenever Nora approaches, the dog barks at her and scares her, and Nora says it was always the same back home and dogs never liked her. Cora suggests that maybe they can tell she's a spazz.

Cora gets a leash on it and leads it out of the alley; it follows her readily enough, although it barks whenever Nora comes near it. Cora leads the dog outside the gates and locks it out. Lily and Jane come up to them at that point, and it turns out Jane and Lily are friends. Lily admits that she didn't want to deal with the dog and she was hiding in her garden, but she started to wonder if Nora had been drafted when Jane didn't come and find her, so she felt bad and came back. Jane chides her for being irresponsible by trying to pick and choose what assignments she takes, and Lily says it's just that the student council always comes up with such unreasonable tasks.

** The Camping Trip, Part 1. By Nora:
The elementary school's geology club is taking a camping trip over the long weekend to study some rock formations, and the Helping Hands are asked along by the club's president, Maria, another friend of Lily's, and their faculty adviser Mrs. Julian, to help carry gear and cook and pitch tents. Lily also asks Ranta to accompany them, which makes Nora happy because she wants to get to know Ranta better. (When Lily wonders whether they're enough help since she and Nora aren't very physical, Nora suggests asking Ranta and Ranta agrees to come since she likes being outdoors.)

As they walk through the woods, Nora and Ranta end up getting separated from the group near nightfall. Nora is scared but Ranta helps her not to panic. She has a map of the forest and tries to use it to get to the campsite, but in the end the two of them just get even more lost. They stumble on a creepy temple in the woods. They decide to sleep there for the night, but giant spiders appear in the middle of the night, terrifying Nora. Ranta hides Nora in the temple and draws off the spiders using her Gift of Running. While Ranta is gone, Nora meets a crazy old hermit in a wooden mask who is obsessed with bottled water. The hermit tells her the temple is the breeding ground of the giant spiders, so she goes with him to his cabin to avoid them. When he gets her to the cabin, though, he straps her into a weird machine to suck all the bottled water out of her.

* Book 2
** The Camping Trip, Part 2. By Ranta:
Ranta runs deep into the forest leading on the giant spiders. They chase and chase her, but she never tires because of her Gift of Running. The spiders finally call out to her, and Ranta is surprised that they can speak. She agrees to listen as long as they don't come too close. The spiders tell her they don't want to hurt her and Ranta asks why they've been chasing her. The spiders say it's because they wanted her to buy some silk pajamas from them. They're spiders, so they weave fine silk, and they also dye it and sew it into fine clothing, sheets, comforters, curtains, tapestries, and other textiles.

Ranta asks how she knows this isn't a trick, and the spiders show her their silken goods and say they sensed someone at the doorstep of their temple and came out to greet them, thinking it was a buyer for the goods. Ranta asks about Nora and if she's all right. The spiders say if she's at the temple, nothing bad has happened to her other than possibly being aggressively sold to, but they warn Ranta that there's an evil hermit living in the woods who's obsessed with bottled water, and if he found her he'll use his evil machine to suck all the bottled water out of her. Ranta asks if the spiders can tell her the way and runs back to the temple as fast as she can.

When Nora isn't at the temple, Ranta finds the cabin and knocks on the door, but the old hermit says he'll be there in a moment. Ranta examines the doorframe and finds that it's held on with wooden pegs, so she backs up, runs at the door as fast as she can, and drop kicks it (like Captain Kirk), breaking it down to find Nora inside being menaced by the evil bottled water hermit. Ranta drop kicks him too, but he's wearing quilted armor under his clothes and it doesn't have any effect. (Since she can't gain as much speed beforehand.) He captures Ranta and ties her up too.

Just as the bottled water sucking is about to begin, the spiders arrive and tie up the hermit with their webbing. They rescue Nora and Ranta and Ranta explains the situation. Nora is still scared and hides behind Ranta, but tolerates the spiders enough to be guided by them to the campsite after Ranta shows them the map. Ranta apologizes for being so useless and Nora says that's okay, she wasn't useless; after all, she was the one who was brave enough to listen to the spiders, which led to their rescue.

Back at the campsite, Lily is relieved to see them and it turns out that she knows the spiders too and has dealt with them before. Ranta buys a shirt from the spiders as thanks for their help, and the camping trip ends without further incident.

** Cora's weekend. By Nora:
When Cora came back to school the week after the camping trip, her hair was black for some reason. While Cora is doing tutoring with Miss Hanover on the subjects that she failed that Nora didn't, Nora, Lily, and Ranta start speculating about why it's now black. Nora starts making up a story about how Cora wanted her brother's record player so she could play something over Victoria's opera, which Nora has heard Cora complain about in the past. Cora's brother wouldn't give it to her unless she traded him a stone from the bottom of Inky Lake at the top of the furthest-away mountain, so Cora set out on a grand adventure to find the stone. She met a bunch of dwarfs who were being menaced by a cruel witch; the dwarves agreed to let her use their secret path if she would defeat the witch for them, so Cora engaged the witch in a game of wits. Cora lost since she's dumb [just have Nora do a scene change after Cora challenges the witch, and have her say, "Of course, Cora lost the game of wits, and now found herself tied up"], and the witch tied her up and was going to eat her, but she managed to trick the witch into garnishing her with blustersage from Lily's garden, and then Cora ate some and huffed and puffed and blew her house down. The witch tried to defeat Cora in a game of wits again, but this time Cora knew the only way she could win a game of wits was not to play, and she made fun of the wart on the witch's nose and attacked her self-esteem, then pulled down the witch's bloomers and revealed her knobbly knees, causing the witch to cry and turn into a housefly and fly away. 

The dwarves let Cora use their secret path, and warn her to watch out for the giant, Andre, living at the top. Cora meets the giant, who challenges her to a disco dance-off in his Golden Disco (not platinum, unfortunately—or maybe yes, Platinum Disco), and Cora uses some choreographed carrots from Lily's garden to give herself a perfect set of backup dancers (carrots with arms and legs that can dance in perfect synch with her). After Cora wins, the giant tries to betray her and eat her, but Cora uses some spring-heeled onions from Lily's garden to gain super jumping powers and jumps on Andre's shoulders, knocking him face-down off the precipice. She then needs to scale a high peak, so she uses some Icarus palm leaves from Lily's garden as wings and flies up to the top, where Inky Lake is. Cora has to dive into Inky Lake to get the stone, which turns her hair black as ink, just as they now see it. A hawk flies over and grabs her, also intending to eat her, and Cora calls him a creampuff and lots of other mean things and makes him drop her, where she lands in her own parents' chimney, causing her little sister to think it's Christmas. When she comes down and her little sister sees that it's not Santa, the only way Cora can make her stop crying is to give her the stone from Inky Lake, so Cora doesn't get the record player after all.

And that, says Nora, is how Cora used her sharp tongue and stuff she stole from Lily's garden to go on a great adventure that ended up turning her hair black. Two possible endings: that was the real story, or some variation on it (maybe Cora told it to Nora in a more self-aggrandizing way), or else Cora says her brother put her to sleep with allergy medicine and dyed her hair while she was out. She did get the record player, but Victoria sang and broke it, like in Goedel, Escher, Bach. (Or as a gift, gave her a record called "I Cannot Be Played on Cora's Brother's Old Record Player".) Victoria created a new song called "I Cannot Be Drowned Out By Cora's Brother's Old Record Player" the breaks the record player. Cora's brother just made her dye her hair as part of a challenge he set her—a horrible challenge in which he has all the advantages, but he chose not to brush her teeth. 

** Math is so hard! By Nora (by Lily?) (by Lily!): 
[do the rest of this story later, possibly in the second book. Rename to Puzzles aren't that hard.]

Nora fails her math test and Miss Hanover takes her in for special tutoring. Lily isn't very good at math either and Cora and Ranta are both stupid so they can't help. One day Lily is asked for help by the puzzle club; they're holding a math puzzle contest and they need someone from outside the club to enter and they ask Lily and the others to enter. Lily agrees, although she knows that they're all terrible at that sort of thing.

Lily, Cora, and Ranta all get knocked out early but somehow Nora makes it to the final round and a showdown against the ace of the puzzle club, Carol. In the final battle Carol chokes and Nora is able to win. The teacher that advises the puzzle club thinks they must have cheated because Nora failed her math test so there's no way she could be so good at puzzles. Nora insists that she didn't cheat and Lily backs her up, although Cora and Ranta have their doubts. To prove his case, the teacher gives her a verbal math test which she fails, but then Miss Hanover comes in and says that Nora is awful at math, but she's good at stories, so any time math is phrased as a story, Nora is good at it (all the problems at the contest were word problems or logic puzzles). To prove it, Miss Hanover asks the teacher to give her a problem. He says some pure numerical thing like 17+32. Miss Hanover rephrases it as a story: Mr. V had 17 puppies and Miss B had 32. When Miss. B became Mrs. V, how many puppies did the V household have, and Nora nails it. Miss Hanover then gives her the prospector and bar of silver story and Nora once again nails it, even though she has no idea how she's doing it or what binary numbers are or any of that. The teacher says he misjudged her and asks her to join the puzzle club but Nora politely turns him down. The next day, Cora and Ranta amuse themselves by asking Nora simple math problems and watching her flail, then rephrasing them as stories and watching her nail it. They wonder if that could be her Gift, but Lily doesn't think so and thinks that's just Nora's personality.
** The hostage crisis. By Ranta.
This story takes place concurrently with "The Cat Girl's Mafia". Ranta receives a note from the girls of the other class (class 6-2; Ranta's class is Class 6-1) demanding that she throw the next mile run, or else. Ranta thinks Cora is behind it, so she confronts Cora in the club, but Cora insists she didn't do it and Nora looks at the handwriting and says that's not what Cora's handwriting looks like. 

Ranta ignores the note and on the day of the next mile run, she receives another note, delivered by Sweta, that says they've captured her little friend Nora and if she doesn't throw the run, they'll torture Nora by showing her the videos of Mrs. Smith's folk sing-alongs from previous years. Even though the mile run is about to begin, Ranta asks the teacher if she can go to the bathroom. The teacher sees the urgency in Ranta's voice and says yes, and Ranta runs off to the garden. She finds Lily and tells her that they've got Nora and she needs Lily's help. Ranta wants to skive off the mile run to help Lily, but Lily tells Ranta she has to go win the run just to prove that they haven't gotten to her, and to leave Nora to her. She goes off to gather her weaponry, and Ranta returns to the track, where the run has already started. She easily wins the run, then runs off to help Lily find Nora, asking her friends and admirers from Class 6-1 to also aid in the search.
** The Cat Girl's Mafia. By Nora.
After the events of Cora's weekend, when Nora is almost rebuffed from talking to Cora by the popular girls of her class (including Willow, the one who's so stupid she copied homework from the stupidest person in class) but Cora interferes and makes them leave Nora alone, the popular girls in the class see Nora with Ranta and decide that she's two-timing and playing a double agent and a stool pigeon and a snitch and all that stuff. [Maybe they actually kidnap her to try and get Ranta to throw the next mile run and let Cora win. They tell Ranta if she doesn't give in, they'll show Nora Mrs. Smith's folk sing-alongs. Like in Freakazoid when he showed them The Best of Marty Ingalls.] 

[ Mention this detail in here somewhere:
*Nora, poor girl, was too serious to do that, so she would kill herself trying to run until she couldn't go anymore, and then walk the rest, panting and sweating and getting herself back into a run every few feet only to peter out again several steps later. *]

The mafia kidnaps Nora and locks her in the laundry room in the basement of the dormitory, intending to torture her until she confesses that she's been blackmailing Cora somehow. They capture her because one of them is a girl who's obsessed with +Harry-Potter+ +Twilight+ a made-up book series that's really awful, not /Cherry Moonflower/ by the way. but she's a kiss-ass who sucks up to the popular kids and gangs up on Nora with them by saying she hates books other than *whatever* and Nora is pretentious for reading them. She pretends like she wants to be Nora's friend and talk about books together but she actually just lures Nora down to the basement to be captured by the mafia.

[ The girl is Amy, who delivered the note to Ranta. The book series she likes is /Horror High/, which is like Monster High. It has Draculicious and Werwolfina Jr. and Frostina and Ghostricia and so on. ]

The mafia demands that Nora talk and they torture her by writing in library books and making her watch the standup comedy routine of one of them which is unbelievably bad (it's so bad you can't even tell where the punchline is supposed to be half the time). Finally she won't talk (because there's nothing to say and they barely even tell her what they want to know anyway) so they just tickle the bottoms of her feet while making her watch videos of Mrs. Smith's folk sing-alongs from previous years.

Nora finally says she'll tell them whatever they want to hear if they'll stop torturing her. The mafia says they'll let her go if she talks, so she tells them that she and Cora are in the same club because Cora wants to make friends with the club president, Lily. Harry Potter Girl asks if Lily is that really weird girl in overalls who's never in class, and Nora says she is. The mafia doesn't believe that, and they're going to "kill" Nora socially by giving her a makeover to look really terrible. (Nora says at this point that she wasn't really afraid of this since no one likes her anyway.)

Just as they're about to start using the mascara on her, Lily bursts in with an array of weaponry from her garden. She pins +Sweta+ Leah to the wall with her shuriken thistles, blasts Greta with a Honeysquirtle gun that shoots sticky stuff all over her, and whips Willow with her birch switch, which isn't magical in any way, but she figured it might be useful for punishing them. Ranta appears, saying she heard the disturbance and figured out this was where Nora was being held, and they rescue Nora and take her to the club room for a nice cup of tea. 

[ Lily should find and capture Amy and squeeze her for information. She finds out where they are. Then there's a knock at the door. Someone looks out and sees Amy, but then when the door is open she falls over dead (not dead, but asleep, because Lily gave her some valerian to make her unconscious.) Lily bursts in with her weapons going and rescues Nora. ] 

In class the next day, Cora tells the mafia that Nora is under her protection as the Godmother and that if they mess with her again, they mess with Cora. Cora quickly says this doesn't mean they're friends, but they're not enemies and Nora's not to be taken hostage or anything of the sort.
** My brother embarrasses me. By Ranta.
Nora and Ranta go to the high school book fair, where they happen to meet Ranta's brother Rel, who embarrasses her by being a fruitcake. 

In more detail...Ranta finds out that the high school is having a book fair because they posted a sign at the elementary school and she happens to see it on her way to lunch. She asks everyone else if they want to go; Lily politely declines and Cora complains, but Nora of course says she wants to go.

A local bookstore is sponsoring the book fair and it's quite large. Nora and Ranta look around a little, and Nora wishes she had more money because she would buy the whole fair if she could. While browsing the used books, Ranta happens to notice her brother, Rel, over in the crafts section. She tries to guide Nora away from him to somewhere he won't see them, but when they turn around, there he is. (He has teleportation. Maybe that's actually his Gift?) 

Ranta introduces Nora to Rel, her fruity brother who makes costumes for the theater club. Rel thinks Nora is just adorable and wants to hug her, but Nora doesn't take well to all the hugging and wigs out, hiding behind Ranta. Ranta scolds her brother for scaring Nora, and Rel apologizes and promises to stop hugging Nora. Nora still won't come from behind Ranta, and circles around, holding Ranta in front of her, until Rel says he'll buy her a book and a cup of coffee to clear things up. Nora perks up at that.

The three of them sit down at the high school's cafe (it's an outdoor book fair) for coffee and books. Rel asks how Ranta's been doing and where she found this cutie pie to befriend (he talks like a fruitcake too), and Ranta says she met her through Lily, who mentioned knowing Rel. Rel does know her, and calls her "that adorable little garden girl". He asks Nora if she likes plays; Nora nods and starts talking reallyreallyreallyfast because she's now crazy on caffeine. Rel says she's adorable when she's crazy on caffeine and starts talking reallyreallyfast along with her while he takes her to buy a book for her, telling her he can get her tickets sometime if she wants to see one of the club's productions. Nora ends up dropping a book she looks at because her hands are shaking so badly, and it gets scuffed and damaged in the fall, so Rel buys that one for her when the stallkeeper gets angry that the book is damaged.

[Try to fit in a part where he mentions Ranta's full name to twang her for her remark about his name at the beginning.]

Ranta suggests that they should really be getting back now that Nora's gone crazy, and Rel protests, but Nora agrees that she thinks she needs to go scream and run in circles for a few hours until the caffeine wears off, thanks him for the book, and apologizes for acting like such a spazoid. Rel goes in for his last hug, which makes Nora wig out and run behind Ranta again, this time quivering. Rel once again finds that too cute, and tells Ranta goodbye and that if she ever needs his advice as a brother, she knows where to find him. Ranta says if she ever wants to get rid of any of her friends, she'll be sure to bring them to Rel.

On the way back, Ranta apologizes for Rel's behavior and Nora says he's a little high-strung, but seems nice, while darting to and fro like a squirrel. Ranta says he's an embarassment and he always just does whatever he wants without thinking about the consequences at all, but Nora replies that her sister loves practical jokes and archery, and that she once had to apologize to the neighbors because her sister shot an arrow through their car tires as a practical joke and then ran away, leaving Nora to deal with the aftermath. Compared with that, Rel isn't so bad. 
** Alone with Lily... By Cora
Cora begins by explaining that although what she said to Nora about her reasons for liking Lily were true, they weren't complete; in fact, she left out the most significant thing that Lily did for her, which involved taking the heat from the Wooden Girls. 

Cora and Lily are alone in the clubroom since Nora and Ranta went to the book fair at the high school together. Cora is nervous because she really wants to do something to make Lily like her. Lily just ignores her for the plants and then talks about Nora, which makes Cora jealous. Cora asks her if she's seen the Wooden Girls recently, and Lily says they're always making a spectacle of themselves, but she hasn't spoken to them recently.

Cora explains to the audience that the Wooden Girls are the twin daughters of Mr. Grayson, the teacher who Lily helped her apologize to. She says you wouldn't believe her if she tried to just describe them, but basically they think of themselves as heroes of justice, and go around the school trying to maintain justice. The older one,  Asha, has the Gift of Strength, and the younger one, Elma, has the Gift of Healing. 

Shortly after Cora threw the book against the window, the Wooden Girls somehow got the idea that she had threatened their father, Mr. Grayson, and thrown a book at him. Since they conflate that with being an ally of injustice, they are challenging Cora to a fight to show her what true justice is like.

Lily, who once again happens to be in the area, interrupts the fight before it can go too far (Asha bent a fence with her punch, and Cora's claws raked Elma, but she healed quickly, so not too much damage was done). Lily tries to explain what happened, but Asha and Elma won't listen and label her an ally of injustice. Deciding that they won't ever listen, Lily tells them she forced Cora into it and it had nothing to do with Cora, who is innocent in the whole affair. They tried to chase her down and attack her, but Lily managed to escape to the garden and somehow shake them. Cora ran after them, but lost the trail somewhere in the garden since she was tired out from running from the Wooden Girls. [Later, unbeknownst to Cora, their father explained what really happened and they stopped trying to beat up Lily. But they still don't like her and regard her as a dangerous outlaw since she's weird and skips class all the time.] 

Cora really really wants to find some way to thank Lily for what happened back then, but she can't think of any way to say it that's not embarrassing (maybe don't say this directly). With the subject of the Wooden Girls exhausted, Cora tries to think of something else to talk about. She tries telling Lily about a great save she made while playing soccer in PE the other day, but Lily doesn't seem to care and Cora feels bad for talking about herself too much. She asks if Lily has been sleeping all right and says Victoria still keeps her awake sometimes. Lily says she's been sleeping fine. Cora asks about Lily's roommate, and Lily says her roommate's name is Alexis, and she'd rather not talk about her. Cora asks if that means they don't get along, and says foolishly that she'd like to punch anyone who doesn't get along with Lily. Lily says "If only it were that simple" and packs up her things and leaves the clubroom.

Cora is puzzled as to what she said to make things go so badly, but Nora and Ranta come in just as she's about to leave, and she settles for yelling at them.
** My first shopping trip. By Nora.

Nora has never been to the town near the school, so the other girls take her. Maybe she gets separated from them somehow and something happens.

Nora, Cora, and Ranta are all buying things (even though Nora's and Cora's parents aren't rich, they still get allowances), but Nora notices that Lily isn't buying anything. She asks Lily about this and Lily says she just isn't seeing anything she wants, but Nora notices her looking longingly at a dress. (Nora earlier in this story sees Lily in her school uniform for the first time and is surprised at how old and shabby it is.) Nora later talks to Cora and Ranta about it and Ranta says that even though Lily seems oblivious, even she must want to be cute sometimes and Nora says it seems like she hasn't got a lot of money. The three girls get together and secretly buy her the dress as a gift.

At more detail: Nora's tights rip one day when Cora (playfully) pushes her into a thorn bush (she doesn't know it's a thorn bush) while the three of them are in the garden with Lily (they weren't working, they were having a nice weekend lunch, which is why Nora wasn't wearing jeans. Lily spends the whole time working anyway, though). Nora says she's starting to run out of clothes since she didn't bring that many from her parents' and she's been surprised by how many things go missing in the laundry. Ranta suggests they go to town the next day and go shopping for clothes. She invites Lily, who conspicuously doesn't answer; Cora also invites herself along if Lily is coming. Ranta says she'll get permission from the dorm mother or one of the teachers to go out, saying since Lily is with them it should be all right.

The next morning, Nora, Cora, and Ranta meet for breakfast. They expect Lily to show up to the elementary school dining hall to eat with them like she usually does, but when she doesn't appear, Nora goes to get her. Ranta asks if she wants her to go along, but Nora says she's all right and she can find the middle school dormitory and ask someone for directions. She goes over to the middle school building and finds a friendly-looking girl in the courtyard and starts a conversation with her. The girl is friendly and says Nora is cute until Nora says she's looking for Lily. The girl asks if she means Lily van Rossum and she says she supposes, since she doesn't really know Lily's last name, and describes Lily. The girl tells her Lily van Rossum is in the school building meeting with Ms. Huckle, one of the teachers, whose office is on the third floor.

Nora goes into the middle school building and finds Ms. Huckle's office. Ms. Huckle is a bear woman and Lily's science teacher; she and Lily have an arrangement where Lily does science work on her own and brings it directly to Ms. Huckle on weekends, and in return she doesn't have to attend science classes. (The other classes, she's just skiving off.) Nora comes in and Lily introduces her to Ms. Huckle; Nora asks if Lily can come shopping with them and Ms. Huckle explains about their arrangement, but says just this once, she'll let Lily go. It also turns out that Miss (not Ms.; she's unmarried, though a paedomorphic loli and hence much older than she seems) Huckle took in the basset hound that was at the elementary school.

Nora notices that Lily's uniform (the middle school and high school have uniforms; see Notes for descriptions of them) doesn't quite fit her and looks a little shabby. Lily also doesn't want to go back to her room to change, but just wants to wear her uniform to go out, and Nora doesn't argue with her about it. 

Nora, Lily, Cora, and Ranta go clothes shopping at the mall. Nora hasn't been in the town yet and is surprised by how normal it is, although there are animal people walking around and some of the stores in the mall sell things made by people's gifts. They go to the clothing store and buy clothes, all except for Lily, who Nora notices is just looking. Ranta also notices and asks her if she's having trouble finding anything. Lily smiles and jokes that she doesn't need new overalls and she doesn't wear any other kind of clothing. But Nora sees her stare longingly at a pretty dress hung up on a rack, and then take it into the dressing room behind their backs while the rest of them are paying. 

Afterwards, they go out to lunch together. Lily orders something very small and says she had a big breakfast and isn't very hungry. Everyone offers to share with her so she can try everything, but she rebuffs them.  Cora insists that she have some of what Cora ordered, so she does, though she's very careful not to take too much.

When Lily is in the bathroom, Nora says she thinks Lily doesn't have a lot of money and she feels bad for dragging her out here. Ranta says she got the same impression, though Cora says she doesn't know anything about not having money since she's rich. Nora says she wants to do something for Lily and mentions the dress she saw Lily try on, saying she'd like to buy it but she doesn't have enough money on her own. Ranta and Cora both agree to contribute. Ranta says even Lily must want to look cute sometimes, she can't wear overalls all the time.

After Lily gets back from the bathroom, they finish eating, and then they drag Lily back to the clothing store, saying that Cora forgot her wallet in the dressing room. While Nora and Lily wait outside, Cora and Ranta go in. Nora says she noticed that Lily was admiring that dress earlier and went to try it on, but didn't buy it. Lily says, embarrassed, that she didn't want them to see that. Nora tells her there's no need to be embarrassed; they're all her friends, and they all care about her, and they want to do something to thank her for bringing them all together. At that moment, Ranta and Cora come out of the store with a dress—not the one Lily tried on, though.

Lily is just staring, and Nora is about to tell them they got it wrong, but Lily takes the dress anyway and thanks them all for their kind gift, winking at Nora to show she likes this one too. Nora thinks that she wants to be that graceful and gracious some day, and so ended her first shopping trip as a St. Galgani's student.
** The Girl [Angel?] in the Courtyard. By Nora. [change title?]

Nora is walking through the courtyard one day (coming back from the library during lunch) and sees a girl in a nightgown sitting on the bench and looking lonely. Although she's shy, she thinks about when she first met Lily and decides to talk to the girl. The girl says her name is Angelique and she's sick, so she spends a lot of time at the hospital and misses a lot of school. She's supposed to be in the infirmary right now but she was bored and sneaked out. Angelique asks about Nora's book and Nora shows her that it's Emily Dickinson, who Angelique has never heard of. Nora reads her a few of the poems and Angelique loves them. Nora has to leave now but Angelique asks if she can see Nora again and Nora says of course.

Nora starts going to see Angelique at the bench every day and reading books with her, because Angelique says she loves reading but the books she gets are always too young for her and she wants to hear about things out in the world that she'll never get to see. Cora comes by one day and sees them and Nora introduces her to Angelique. Cora thinks there's something weird about her but can't quite say what. (And we get to see the adorable and rare sight of Cora being shy.)

One day Nora asks why Angelique can't find someone to heal her, with all the different gifts at the school, and Angelique says it's too late for her and all she can do is wait. As Nora is leaving the bench, Cora, Lily, and Ranta come up and inform Nora that Lily and Ranta can't see Angelique. Nora is puzzled by this, but Cora insists that it's because Angelique is a ghost (which she is terrified of). Nora denies that she's a ghost, but Lily gently convinces her she and Cora are the only ones who can see Angelique and cats are able to see spirits, and that she shouldn't keep seeing her because it could be dangerous.

The next day Nora asks straight out if Angelique is a ghost. Angelique asks if Nora will come back later that evening, and then she'll give her an answer. Nora knows from this that Angelique really is a ghost, but she decides to believe that Angelique wouldn't hurt her and come back. She does, and Angelique tells Nora that she never had any friends because she was always sick and could never come to school, and she died alone in the infirmary before her parents could arrive. Nora says she's Angelique's friend now and it's okay. Angelique cries and thanks her, holding Nora's hands tearfully.

Nora says at the end that Angelique never appeared again after that. She says she hopes Angelique is somewhere nice with lots of friends.


* Book 3:
An autumn book.
** The Water Balloon War. By Cora.
Cora is a cat, so she hates water. But some of the other girls, led on by Ranta, are throwing water balloons and they're coming after her. Can Cora escape their deadly water balloons and squirt guns? Write like a parody of a Western. Takes place on the last warm day of the year, just as a chill wind is blowing into St. Galgani's academy that heralds the end of summer.

More detail: Cora and the Fiorentino family hear from Amy that Ranta and her friends from 6-1 are planning to have a picnic on the grass to celebrate the last days of summer. Cora, Greta, Sweta, Leah, Gracie, and Amy go after them with water guns and water balloons. (Willow is afraid, so she stays out of it.) They arrive to discover that they've been betrayed; Ranta and her friends are all armed with water guns and balloons as well, and have set up a counter ambush. In the first onslaught, they destroy Amy and Leah, who are both wearing unnecessarily nice clothes, and scatter Gracie, Greta, Sweta, and Cora. Cora ends up with Sweta, hiding behind a shed, but Sweta quickly dies when she tries to do a Butch and Sundance with Cora without waiting for Cora to actually agree to it. ("Dying" means getting soaked and losing all your ammo so you have to go back to the dormitory to change.)  

Ranta sends her other three friends after Greta and Gracie and takes Jill to go after Cora. Cora escapes from behind the shed using her catlike agility to leap across the roofs and the trees. She manages to escape Ranta and Jill and come up above the other three. Just as they kill Greta, Cora attacks and manages to kill one of them by dropping her balloons, then take another with her gun (since she's in a tree, and has a big, fancy Super Soaker and they have smaller pistols that can't shoot up into the tree). Cora yells for Gracie to escape, but Gracie runs right into Ranta and Jill, who gun her down. 

All her allies are dead, but Cora thinks she's safe in the tree. Leah returns, this time with a giant Ghostbusters water pack, but Ranta, Jill, and the other survivor from Ranta's team (let's call her Meg) gun down Leah before she can use the Ghostbusters water pack, and then Meg takes it and it has enough pressure to reach into the tree. Cora is chased out and ends up jumping the fence to leave the elementary school, since Ranta knows her course will be to try and reach the dormitory, where they can't squirt her anymore, and has Meg block her from going that way. 

Cora makes a run for the garden, hoping she can hide somewhere in there, but Ranta, Jill, and Meg trap her inside a dead-end section against the hedge and shoot her until they're out of water. Since Cora hates water so much, she can barely even move after getting so soaked, and she certainly can't contemplate revenge, especially when Jill takes her own weapons and uses them all on her. (Ranta is going to stop, but Jill goes ahead and does it and says Cora deserves it for that stunt she pulled at the mile run.) They leave Cora shivering and mewling in the garden

After she finally gets cornered and gets blasted to pieces ("killed") by the posse, Cora comes into Lily's garden, moving without thinking, crying. Lily feels a little bit sorry for her and gives her a towel from the satchel, but Cora is still crying and shaking and Lily asks if there's anything else she can do. Cora asks if Lily will give her a hug, and Lily grudgingly does. Nora comes up as they're hugging and Lily gets embarrassed suddenly and says it was nothing. Cora is mad at Nora for ruining their hug and asks what she's doing there, and Nora says that Ranta told her where Cora had gone and that now was her chance to get Cora; she has a water balloon that Ranta gave her that she was going to throw at Cora, but now she doesn't think she will. Cora gets angry and yells that she doesn't need Nora's pity; Nora asks innocently if she should throw the water balloon after all, and Cora whimpers that she'll gratefully accept Nora's pity after all.

Ends with Cora getting a cold becauase she was in the water balloon war on a day when it wasn't really that warm (though it was warm enough that they felt like having a water balloon war). Ranta apologizes and brings Cora a Thermos of hot chocolate, some cookies, and a basket of vitamin C-packed grapefruits  as an apology.
** Writing stories is harder than it looks. By Nora:
One day Nora is sitting in the clubroom writing a story. Lily and Cora come in and ask what she's doing and when she tells them, they're both full of ideas for great stories. Nora tells them she's writing about a fairy who makes friends with a flower, but Cora thinks that's dumb and if Nora writes about the fairy she'll just be a spaz with no friends. Cora suggests writing about a cat girl who is great at sports and benevolent to all humanity, even her rival, an arrogant rich girl who needs to be put in her place. The cat girl does the rich girl the service of putting her in her place and the rich girl thanks her and is a better person from then on.

Nora doesn't like that story and neither does Ranta, who just came in and heard the end of it. Ranta suggests instead the story of an evil cat overlord who oppresses all of her people, and a humble serf girl who discovers one day that she can run and run and run, and starts running, surpassing all the overlord's servants and finally running all the way to a promised land where there are no evil cat overlords, then returning and leading the rest of her people to this promised land. Nora says she isn't much good with adventure stories, so Lily suggests a story about a benevolent tree who gives everything it has to a greedy young girl, eventually ending up dying and shriveled. When it finally dies, the girl realizes the friend she's lost. Cora is in tears, but Ranta and Nora say there's already a story like that and Lily says oops, she was found out. (Or maybe a story about a boy who flies a giant peach over the ocean with a bunch of insects [and an arachnid], which Ranta and Nora have heard before.)

** The harvest festival. By Lily.
Lily has to organize the harvest festival since as the garden girl, the job just sort of falls on her. But she's being challenged left and right by the student council and the teachers
** TODO My greatest shame. By Ranta. (or "How the rivalry began. By Ranta"):

A flashback story. When Ranta was in fourth grade, she wanted to try out for the track team. She sent her mother a letter asking for permission and her mother gave it. When Ranta went to the coach to sign up for tryouts, the coach let her join without trying out. Ranta didn't think too much about it, but just went with it. However, she was confused when the other members of the team wouldn't include her in anything and seemed to resent her. She tried being friends with them, but none of them wanted to hang out with her, except for Cora, the ace of the track team, who actually stuck up for Ranta in a big speech where she admitted that she's dumb so she might be missing something, but Ranta has been keeping up with all of them and surpassing some of them in practice, and they should respect her talent.

One of the other members says Ranta's family bought her way onto the team, but Cora tells her off and says Ranta obviously has talent and the coach must have known from her PE classes how good she was and let her skip the tryout process, which was also how Cora got on the team when she wanted to. Cora apologizes to Ranta and says the other girls read too much and come up with all these crazy theories about things. Ranta is very grateful to Cora for sticking up for her and says she'll work hard to earn Cora's respect.

Then one day, Ranta overhears the coach and the assistant coach talking, with the assistant coach asking about the rumors that Ranta's family bought her way onto the team. The coach says that's not exactly what happened, but Ranta's mother did just happen to show up right when she was wondering how she was going to pay to get the high school team across the country for a big meetup in the coming months, and offered the use of a private jet. Under the circumstances, the coach didn't feel she could reject Ranta when Ranta came and asked to join the team.

Ranta feels sick, and she feels worst of all about the fact that Cora stuck up for her and threw her lot in with someone who bought her way onto the team. Ranta tries to come up with a plan to make things right, and she finally remembers a book she read where someone in a similar situation suddenly started acting cold towards the person who stuck up for her, because she wanted that person's former friends to reunite with her over the issue of hating the protagonist. Ranta does this by telling Cora she won't rest until she's the ace of the track team, and then training and training and training until she can beat Cora. It seems hopeless, with Ranta always a second or two behind Cora, until one day her work sort of explodes and she manages to run a mile in eight minutes, beating her former time of fourteen minutes by a substantial amount. She realizes from this that her gift is the Gift of Running. Ranta defeats Cora and rebuffs all of Cora's attempts at good sportsmanship with bad sportsmanship, and then quits the team, saying they're all too slow to match her. Everyone hates her, except for Cora, who is puzzled about why she's acting so different, but also mad and determined to regain her title as the fastest. This is what Ranta wanted since she didn't want Cora to suffer for taking her side in the fight; she also wanted to quit since she found out that her mother bought her way onto the team. 

So, surprisingly, it's actually Ranta who began the rivalry, and not Cora. 

** The apple of the stars. By Nora.
[Note: I might expand this into a whole book and have Ranta and Cora be there too. By the way, check out this Strawberry Sunflower -> Stargate SG-1 character correspondence:
Lily -> Samantha Carter: Both blonde, both scientists, and Samantha had a braid when she was on Atlantis.
Nora -> Daniel Jackson: Intellectual, humanities-oriented, not a fighter.
Cora -> Teal'c: Not quite human, fighter.
Ranta -> Jack O'Neill: Athletic, strong, good judgment, fighter.]

One day, Lily and Nora are in the garden, and Lily notices that the apples on the applegate tree are ripe. She suggests eating some. She warns Nora that some of the applegates have wormholes in them, so they'd better be careful. The first one Nora bites into sucks both of them into a wormhole that leads off to an alien planet on the other side of the galaxy. 

Nora and Lily meet the locals, who I'm imagining somewhat like CS Lewis's /hrossa/. They're having crop problems (Nora is able to figure out bits of the language after Lily tells her to think of it like a puzzle.) Lily helps them by introducing them to crop rotation (because she can feel the feelings of plants; she can sense that their current crops aren't getting all the nutrients they need out of the soil). She shows them a weed that's flourishing and teaches them about all sorts of things they can do with the fruit of that weed, like George Washington Carver. After that, she and Nora go back to the applegate tree where they appeared and find an applegate that takes them back to Earth.

** Halloween night. By Nora.
Nora's first time trick-or-treating inside St. Galgani's Academy and the surrounding area. (I planned the shopping trip story before this so I could include things introduced in that story in this story.) Of course since supernatural stuff exists something creepy should happen for real. But not any tedious ghost or haunted house type stuff, okay?

* Book 4
A winter book.
** The great hunt. By Cora:
I don't know if I should even go here. But, don't you think it might be funny to do a story where there's a rat in the dormitory, and the club is enlisted to hunt it down, and Cora, as a cat, becomes obsessed with catching it, as if her pride as a cat depends on it? After a great chase (where the rat is shown to be surprisingly intelligent), they finally catch it. Cora eats it.

The scenario is that everyone is stuck inside because of the rain and Cora is going a little bit crazy because she wants to be out running around. The dorm mother of the high school comes to the club and asks them if they can hunt down a legendary rat who's been living in their dormitory and stealing the food that students hide under their mattresses and in their bedside tables for years. Cora jumps at the chance. She proceeds to smash up the dormitory while chasing it (with some help from Lily and Ranta). After Cora eats it, they have to clean up the dormitory, but the high school students mostly think they're cute and help them clean up, rather than being angry.
** The cafe in the snow. By Nora.:
Nora is wandering on the grounds one day when it starts snowing unexpectedly. She's too far to get back to the school and she isn't dressed for the snow, but she catches sight of a tiny little cafe in a cottage squeezed into a little grove of elder trees. She goes in and meets the shopkeeper, a nice old fellow who serves her the best cup of hot chocolate she's ever had, along with a delicious plate of toast and sausages. (Maybe this is more of a winter story.) She tries to come back the next day with Lily and the others, but the cafe is nowhere to be found. Nora starts going every day to look for it, since she's mad at Cora for saying she's losing her mind. The next time it snows, she manages to find it again, and the shopkeeper tells her the cafe only appears when it's snowing outside and disappears as soon as the snow stops. Nora tells this to Lily, Cora, and Ranta, who still don't believe her (although Lily is nicer about it than Cora, who says she just read something in a book and then got it confused with reality). Miss Hanover happens to overhear and tells Nora that she knows what Nora is talking about. She says that cafe has been on the school grounds for five hundred years, since before there was a school there, and the owner was cursed by the owner of a rival cafe who went out of business because he did dishonest things like filling his sausages with bread and soya bean, so now he only appears when it snows out and spends the rest of the time sleeping. 

The next time it snows, Miss Hanover asks the rest of the club for help with something out on the grounds, and she and Nora bring the others to the cafe. The shopkeeper recognizes Miss Hanover from when she was a student at the school and came there, and says she's really grown up to be pretty. Lily, Cora, and Ranta are all shocked that the cafe was real, but they all have hot chocolate and sausages and acknowledge that it's really good. Cora apologizes for thinking that Nora was losing her mind, even though Nora really is losing her mind, and next time it'll be for real. (Says Cora.)

** The labyrinth. By Ranta.:

Another Nora x Ranta story. This time Nora gets to be the one who saves Ranta (to give her a chance to do something cool).

Nora hears that the high school is putting on a production of "Blithe Spirit" and wants to go see it; Ranta's brother Rel works as a costume designer for the theater club, so Ranta tells Nora she can get her backstage to see a dress rehearsal. Rel tells them to meet him at the old playhouse, so Ranta and Nora go there.

They arrive, and no one is backstage. They try to leave, but the stage door, instead of leading to the outside, leads into a dark hallway. Nora and Ranta manage to stay together by holding hands and walking along the wall. They come into a lighted hallway lined with paintings that look very Mannerist (late Michelangelo), with a locked door at the end. Nora is a little bit bashful about all the naked men, and is rather surprised when the paintings start talking to her. The paintings tell her they know where the key is, but each of them will only give her one piece of information and she has to use inference and deduction to figure out where the key is. They do one of those logic puzzles like in discrete math textbooks and Nora figures out where the key is and gets through into the next room. 

In the next room Nora and Ranta have to get through a series of hallways like the Temple of the Ancients in Final Fantasy 8 where all the junctions look the same and some of them lead in circles. They're given a piece of chalk to make marks on the floor, but soon discover that the marks somehow get pointed in the wrong direction whenever they return to a room. (They follow a marked door and comes to a room without a mark; this should be impossible, because Nora marked all the rooms she was in, so she must have never taken that door, even though the mark was on it, so the mark must have been tampered with.) [Also, they have to make the marks on a chalkboard in the middle of the room, just to be sure they can't use the location of the mark itself as any kind of clue.] Nora draws marks in all four directions, leaves a junction, and then immediately returns to it and discovers that all the marks get turned exactly one direction counterclockwise. With this knowledge, she can reorient herself according to a shifted compass rose (like a group, e.g. the group of integers mod 4 under addition being represented by 0 1 2 3 being the original marks, and 1 2 3 4 being the new marks, with an isomorphism between them). She manages to escape from this room.

In the next room they find five sleeping tapirs. A sign tells them that four of the tapirs are switchers—the first time you ask them a question, they'll either lie or tell the truth, randomly. After that, the switchers switch off between lying and telling the truth—they'll always do one and then the other. The fifth tapir is the truth teller that can tell them how to leave the maze. They have to find the truth tapir, and they can only ask two questions, though they can address the two questions to two different tapirs or ask the same one two questions.

Nora thinks about the puzzle for a while and then figures it out. She wakes up a random tapir and asks if that tapir is the truth tapir. He says no, and Nora tells Ranta that this means he was telling the truth and he'll now lie. She asks, of the five tapirs, which one is most definitely not the truth tapir. The tapir points him out, and they wake him up and ask him, whereupon he admits that he is the truth tapir and leads them out of the maze by revealing a secret tunnel out of the tapir room. 

Once outside, Ranta asks how Nora would have reacted if the first tapir had said he was the truth tapir. Nora says that was the easy part—if he said yes, then he was either the truth tapir or a lying switcher. If he was a lying switcher, he would switch to telling the truth and they could ask him where the truth tapir was. If he was the truth tapir he would tell them, honestly, that it was him. Ranta praises Nora's puzzling ability and Nora says it's not that great, but Ranta says she's really impressed and she's glad Nora's on her side. They go to meet Rel at the new playhouse, but the rehearsal is long over—they were inside the labyrinth for over three hours. Rel apologizes for his mistake—someone from the art department came over and told them they had to leave since the labyrinth had manifested itself, then had gone to get someone who was good at puzzles to defeat it. When Ranta tells him about how Nora defeated it, Rel hugs Nora and calls her adorable, deeply embarrassing her (and Ranta).

** Recursion is confusing. By Nora.
Nora finds a model of the school in one of the storage rooms and ends up inside it, where she finds a model of the school, inside which she finds another model of the school, inside which she finds a model of another place (like Disneyland, maybe), inside which she finds a model of somewhere else, inside which she finds a model of the school, which she goes into and finds herself back at school, apparently having bottomed out the recursion (or has she?!?) Continuing my vein of stealing stuff from Gödel, Escher, Bach for StrawSun. 

When she gets in line at Disneyland there can be a sign that says "Instructions: Snoc yourself to the queue. The car of the queue will be admitted to the ride. Each time the car of the queue is admitted, the cdr of the queue will replace the queue. Those attempting to cons will forced to snoc themselves to the end of the queue."

In another level there can be people who don't use recursion in their speech. They can't use complement clauses. 

I want to incorporate Romanesco broccoli, the recursive vegetable. Since this book has such a plant theme to it.

Nora finds the model because it's winter time and she's exploring the inside of the buildings. Maybe she finds it in the high school building, where all the oldest buildings are.
** TODO This garden, my sanctuary. By Lily:

About how Lily is mistreated by her class, who all think flowers are dumb and useless. That's why she hates middle schoolers and all her friends are in elementary school or high school. Lily gets them back using the ragtime weed, a ragweed derivative that unleashes ridiculously allergenic pollen whenever it hears ragtime music. (Because plants can respond to music.)

Lily begins her recollections of this time because it's now raining outside all the time, so she can't go out in the garden as much, and she has a harder time ditching classes now because they find her and make her go. Miss Huckle holds to their deal as long as she's doing something science-related with her free periods, but Lily was also ditching the classes of other teachers that she didn't have deals with and they didn't like it, but couldn't do anything about it because they couldn't find her (because of her secret, sealed area of the garden).  

At the beginning of the year, Lily entered seventh grade. A lot of new students come in at middle school since it's easier for kids that age to take being at a boarding school, so there was pretty much no one in her class that Lily knew. (They use the Japanese system—one class, which the different teachers come to at different times, except for science and PE.) Everyone did first day introductions during homeroom, and Lily introduced herself and her gift and hobbies, and ended by saying she hoped they could all be friends.

Rather than actually bullying her, the girls just don't really want to talk to her because whenever she talks to them, they talk at cross-purposes. The other girls are all into makeup and parties and boyfriends, and Lily isn't and just wants to keep being a kid for a little while longer. She discovers this through joining conversations during lunch and from a group she works with on a group assignment. In science class, when everyone chooses a partner, Lily ends up working with a boy who tries to make moves on her but she isn't interested and one of the other girls gets jealous because she's into that boy, creating a whole tween drama that Lily doesn't actually know about. She finds out because after the boy invites her to eat lunch with him one time, during which he talks about himself and dating the whole time trying to impress her and get her to "date" him. The boy wants to hold hands and Lily doesn't want to and excuses herself. The other girls think this is a date and they create a tween melodrama by accusing Lily of stealing the other girl's guy. Lily says it's not like that at all and the other girls snicker at her, saying it's always the flower-heads who attract the guys. After she refused to "date" him the boy won't work with her anymore and the other girls gossip. No one in the class will work with her anymore on anything and they don't want to talk to her.

Lily talks to Miss Hanover about how fed up she is. (She was in Miss Hanover's class for sixth grade so they are still friends.) She admits that her mother and father used to fight a lot about money and credit cards and other things that she didn't understand, and she tells Miss Hanover, "I don't understand why they want to grow up so fast, and have to start worrying about those things. I'm only twelve. I just want to stay a child a little bit longer." Miss Hanover tells Lily there's nothing wrong with that and then goes into a time she felt like that and talks about playing a trick on everyone in class. They all called her childish for playing a trick like that, so she was able to convey to them her desire to remain childish. Miss Hanover adds that she's not saying that's a good thing to do, but Lily decides to play a trick on all of them. She leaves some ragtime weed on a high cupboard at the back of the classroom and plays a radio next to it to make it release hyperallergenic pollen. Everyone sneezes a lot and Lily laughs at them, releasing her stress. She then later feels bad and tells the science teacher that she played the trick. The science teacher says the work she's done so far is brilliant and she-// can tell she's having some trouble with the other kids, so she makes a deal with Lily. As long as Lily keeps up with the tests, she'll let Lily skip science classes and go work in the garden. 

One day in the present, Lily is supposed to join a team of three for a presentation in social studies, but no one wants to work with her because she's weird. Lily is sad and just leaves class early, heading for the clubroom to hang out by herself. She comes in and finds Nora in there reading. Nora is reading "Lines composed above Tintern Abbey" again. She senses that Lily is somehow sad, so she starts telling Lily about the poem and how Wordsworth weaves a vision of a wild forest and stream, its sources starting high in the mountains, and tells of how he found peace in that wood through learning over the years how to find it within his mind whenever he felt the world getting to be too much. Nora says that Lily already has one up on Wordsworth because she's already found the sublime peace of nature without the benefit of years and years of experience, and Nora thinks it's already the cause behind many of Lily's "little, nameless, unremembered acts of kindness and of love." Lily describes the peace she feels being with Nora and how grateful she is to have such a friend who understands feelings like hers about the garden. Lily hugs Nora and thanks her for being her friend.

** The Christmas party. By Nora.
A Christmas story of some kind, but I don't know the details yet. It's not actually Christmas, everyone goes home for Christmas vacation and comes back next year.

* Book 5
A spring book. Should have a theme of the annual field day between St. Galgani's, "Hogwarts", and "Tokiwadai".
** Knocking on wood—Fight the Wooden Girls! By Cora.
Cora picks a fight with Asha and Elma Grayson, the daughters of her old teacher Mr. Grayson. Asha and Elma are yet another pair of expies of Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan. (Asha Grayson is also an on-the-sly reference to Asha Greyjoy, which no good kid should understand.) Asha and Elma are known as the Wooden Girls or the Wooden Twins because they're twins and both of their names are a tree with -a on the end (*Ash*a and *Elm*a). Asha has the Gift of Strength and has super strength. Elma has the Gift of Healing and can recover from any injury. They fight crime. They're at the middle school.

They get in a fight with Cora because one day Lily is in the garden and Cora is with her, trying to persuade her to partner Cora for the upcoming sixth/seventh grade mixer field day, where each sixth grader is supposed to team up with a seventh grader and do events. Lily insists that she's going to partner Nora even though Cora begs her. 

All of a sudden, Asha jumps out from behind a tree and attacks Lily. Cora gets in the way but is ploughed through; Lily is saved because her burglar bramble surges up and tangles Asha in brush. Asha demands to know where Lily's growing the drug plants, and Lily, confused, asks where she got an idea like that. Asha says the other girls in Lily's class told her she was growing drugs and selling them to the younger kids. Before Lily can answer, Cora leaps in and angrily challenges Asha to a fight for Lily's honor, but Elma appears and the Wooden Girls brag that they outnumber Cora two to one. Cora is going to fight anyway, but Lily tells the Wooden Twins they can search the whole garden if they want, but they won't find any drug plants. Elma says she thinks Lily is telling the truth and asks why the others would want to frame her. Cora jumps in and says they're all just jealous; Elma says they'd better investigate more, even though Asha still wants to fight.

The next day, Cora is once again wheedling Lily, when the Wooden Girls return and attack again, saying the other girls told them Lily lied to them. Cora is once again going to fight for Lily's honor, but just as they're about to fight (Cora and Asha), some of Lily's violence-abhorring vines whip around and grab Asha and Elma by the ankles. Lily tells them if they don't believe her, she'll just have to feed them something from the garden and show them it's not drugs. She grabs some ordinary grass and comments to Cora that she thinks this is safe, it looks like grass, but it might also be footman's grass, a deadly nerve toxin, and if it is, there's enough in her hand to kill eight horses. Cora, cottoning on, says they'd better feed it to Asha first to find out, since she looks tough enough to survive it, and if she lives they can try Elma. Asha and Elma both panic and beg for mercy, saying they'll leave Lily alone. Before letting them down, Cora gives a speech about how Lily is the soul of generosity, the spirit of mercy, the kindest, gentlest creature around, beautiful at heart, pure of spirit, a lovely person, and with beautiful eyes. Lily says she still won't partner Cora because that would leave Nora alone. Asha offers to partner Cora, which Cora gladly accepts, totally changing her tune about Asha being a rapscallion and poltroon and such.
** A friend in middle school? By Lily. (By Nora?)

Lily makes friends with Akari Kanzaki, a transfer student from the world of Neither Here Nor There. Akari has trouble fitting in because she's weird. She is obsessed with a book called /Cherry Moonflower/; Strawberry Sunflower is to Cherry Moonflower as /Goedel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid/ is to /Copper, Silver, Gold: An Indestructible Metallic Alloy/. (Akari is from "Hogwarts"; she's staying at St. Galgani's as part of the festival. She finds out about Lily because she sees her walking around the grounds and follows her into the garden one day, since she asked around for all the "weirdos" and is trying to chase them down and talk to them.)

[this opens the door for Jinjo, Ishinobu, Ai, and others to appear in this book since it's been established that they're in the same world. Maybe Ishinobu is an old friend of Miss Hanover's or something. And maybe Ai is a student at "Tokiwadai" or "Hogwarts".]

Akari decides that she needs to defeat the Helping Hands and establish the bizarro version of the Helping Hands after she notices the similarities between the characters in /Cherry Moonflower/ and the real-life girls. She has fantasies about setting up a club just like in /Cherry Moonflower/ and the Helping Hands are in her way because they can't have two identical clubs at the school. She gets Lily to agree to shut down her club if Akari can defeat all of them. (They become friends at the end, okay? At first Akari is just a weird transfer student who takes an interest in Lily because she spends so much time out of class and Akari is busybody.) Lily does this because she believes in all of her members and doesn't think they can be beaten so easily. Akari is allowed to pick any challenge she wants and compete with the Helping Hands girls. 

She picks a trivia contest and easily defeats Cora (she has photographic memory, remember?), beginning with a cry of "Cora! Hotheaded, cat-eared sports girl with a soft side—you're obviously just like Necomori, aren't you? And I know how to defeat you! I challenge you to a trivia contest!"

Akari then takes down Ranta in a tongue-twister contest, saying "Ranta—mature, dependable, tolerant, but with a secret weakness—you are just like Rani, aren't you? And I know how to defeat you! I challenge you to a tongue-twister contest!"

Akari is going to challenge Nora next, but Lily steps forward and says she can't allow Akari to just keep on stepping on her girls and she'll be the one to fight Akari next. Nora asks if that's really okay and says she doesn't know about this, but Lily tells Nora not to worry, she has an ace up her sleeve. Akari says she feels bad taking out the leader and leaving the small fry for last, but Lily convinces her that she won't have such an easy time with Nora. Akari challenges Lily to a singing contest, saying "Lily! The big sister of the group, with a warm, kind air, who loves gardening—you're just like Liria! And I know how to defeat you! I challenge you to a singing contest!" It turns out that Lily's singing voice is pretty bad, although Cora says she still prefers it to Victoria's constant opera. Akari's singing voice is just a bit better, so Akari wins.

Akari then confronts Nora and asks if she wants to give up. Nora says no, she has to fight for the club too, and Akari says "Are you sure? Because I know your weakness. Scaredy, and a little childish, a smart, great reader with a taste for the classics—Nora! You're just like Nina! And I know how to defeat you! I challenge you to a riddle contest!"

Of course, Nora is great at riddles because of her puzzle-solving abilities. Akari keeps on ramping up the difficulty of her riddles, but Nora answers every one and throws back some real whoppers. Akari is able to answer them at first because she memorized several riddle books, not that she thought she needed to because Nina is so bad at riddles (as she brags when the battle begins). But Nora finally manages to defeat her by making up a riddle on the spot, which isn't in any book. With Akari defeated, Lily then reveals that when Akari challenged her, she read /Cherry Moonflower/ and was able to figure out from that what kind of contest Akari would challenge each of them to. But Akari didn't know that Nora is good at puzzles, unlike Nina, the character in the book, so Lily knew they were never in any danger.

Defeated, Akari is devastated that her dream to create a club will go unfulfilled, but Lily points out that since they're so similar to the characters from the book, she can just hang out with their club. Akari asks if they'd really let her do that even after she tried to take the club from them; Cora says no, but Lily says they would. Akari is touched, and she and Lily become friends.

** Parent's day. By Nora.
The families of the students come to visit. Nora's father and sister Linda come to see her (her mother has a real job and couldn't get time off, but her father is just a literature professor). Cora's parents, little sister, and older brother come to visit too. Cora hates Linda because Linda falls in love with her brother Lucian at first sight and Cora already has a crush on him. (Plus unlike Nora, Linda is fully as obnoxious as Cora, if not more so.) Ranta's mother also stops by and they see how rich and powerful she is. (She isn't around at first because she goes to the high school to see Rel first.) 

Lily feels bad because neither of her parents come. Nora tries to make her feel better. Lily always knew it would be a longshot since her mother is a single mother to five kids and works constantly, and her father also works a lot and has a new wife and baby to look after. But she still feels disappointed. No one comes (I'm resisting the temptation to make something nice happen for poor Lily.) But she still has Nora, the object of her implied yuri love.
** The day of the races. By Cora.
I don't have all the details yet but the basic idea is that students from another school come in and challenge the St. Galgani's students to a sports match. They might be trolls, or they might be from Hogwarts, but either way they cheat. (They might be X-Men, or they might be from Tokiwadai.) Cora, as the ace of the sixth grade, has to compete with them. Ranta too. Lily and Nora act as cheerleaders.

I like the idea of a three-school meetup between St. Galgani's, Tokiwadai, and Hogwarts (obviously the latter two under different names). I also kind of think Akari should be a student at Hogwarts, not St. Galgani's. And Ai could be at Tokiwadai. 

(the field day is divided into divisions—first and second grades, fourth and fifth grades, sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, and then the high school.)
** The talent show. By Cora.
Cora wants to do a high-flying trapeze act for the talent show so she can win the grand prize, a hi-fi sound system for drowning out Victoria. She knows as a cat, she has the acrobatic and athletic abilities for an act like that, but none of her friends are capable of keeping up with her and there aren't any other cat girls that she knows well enough to ask them to compete with her. Lily knows Garnet, a high school second-year known as Fat Garney by some of the mean kids, who is a cat girl, but she's not athletic enough to keep up with Cora. (The talent show is free age group; you can partner up with people outside your division.) 

Lily tells her the only person she knows of who's as athletic as Cora is Ranta, and maybe Cora should consider asking Ranta to team up for this act. Cora resists, of course. But she hears from Nora that Ranta is being wheedled by Rel to team up with him and do an act, and Cora decides it's worth it and goes and begs Ranta to join her, yelling at Rel that she saw Ranta first (which Rel laughs at, because he saw Ranta two weeks after she was born). Cora begs her to help, and Ranta says she doesn't want to team up with Rel or Cora, and would rather just sit in the audience with Lily and Nora and make fun of everyone doing an act. 

Cora is devastated, but Ranta comes back later and tells Cora that Lily asked her to team up with Cora on her behalf, so she'll do it for Lily. They team up and practice the trapeze act, with a great deal of yelling and fighting. Finally, the day of the contest comes. Many amazing acts come on before them, and Ranta wonders if they have a chance to win with all these acts. Cora says they've got to win, because she needs that sound system, and plus, they worked too hard not to win. Right before they go on, Ranta admits that she doesn't mind even if they don't win, because she unexpectedly had fun teaming up with Cora to try hard for something. She also apologizes for what happened when they first met (recounted in "How the rivalry began"), saying she was ashamed to find out that they were right and her mother had bought her way onto the team. Cora is startled, but they're called on before she can say anything.

Cora and Ranta do well, but Cora makes a mistake because of her distraction from what Ranta said. Afterward, Cora gets mad at Ranta for messing with her emotions like that right before the act, and Ranta gets mad and says maybe she shouldn't make her emotions so easy to mess with. In the end, they win runner-up, losing to Lily's Botanical Circus, where she had plants (like the choreographed carrots) performing circus routines, including a clownthistle routine, a dandy lion jumping through a flaming hoop, and a tiger lily magic act. (It happens offscreen, 'cause all that stuff is just pun-based and would be really hard to describe. I think Cora and Ranta's act happens offscreen too; just cut to them fighting afterwards because Cora made a mistake and she's blaming Ranta for saying weird things.)
** TODO Why aren't you my friend? By Cora. [delayed from book 2. Too early and already too much heavy stuff with the Lily story. Do something more lighthearted, I think, involving Cora.]

Cora discovers that Lily doesn't consider her a friend when she finds out that the other three girls were keeping an exchange diary behind her back, with the title "My friends". (They just didn't think she would be into it.) She is devastated to find this out, because she thought that after their time in the club together they were friends. Cora confronts Lily in the garden and asks her for a straight answer. Lily admits that it's because Cora is always fighting with Nora and Ranta, who Lily does consider her friends, and that makes it hard to consider Cora a friend. Also, Cora acts quite a bit like the girls in the middle school who exclude Lily from things; Lily mentions that the way she treated Nora early on is similar to how Lily was treated by people at the middle school, and although Nora seems to have forgiven her, Lily hasn't. (Lily is like, in love with Nora, so she gets angry at people on Nora's behalf, even Cora.)

Cora makes a vow that she won't fight with Ranta and she'll be nicer to Nora for a week. She starts giving Ranta back massages and listening to Nora talk about books, although it gives her pain. She gives up after two days and can't do it. Lily asks Cora why it's so important to her to be friends when she already has friends and says that she became friends with Nora because Nora liked her garden and seemed nice and didn't have any friends, putting her in a similar situation to Lily herself, who didn't have any friends in the middle school. Cora says that's exactly why, because she feels like all of her friends in class just hang out with her because she's good at sports and brassy, and she says she wants to start trying to be more feminine when she gets to middle school and she's afraid they'll leave her if that happens, but she knows Lily will love her because Lily loves everyone. Lily says she heard about what happened when Nora asked Cora to be her friend and advises Cora to look around her more closely if she wants a friend who will like her no matter what. Cora is sad, because she takes that to mean that she and Lily will never be friends, but Lily says that's not what she means, and tells Cora that if she wants to change who she is, finding new friends is one way to do that, but a better way is to change herself first and see who comes out to be her friend.

Cora finally cottons on to what Lily is saying, and so one day after class she goes up to Nora and asks her to be her friend. Nora says no, then says she was only joking. She asks what made Cora suddenly decide to do this, since they're already sort of like friends, and Cora says that even though Nora is annoying, she's still someone Cora would like to have as a friend. They add Cora to the exchange diary, even though Ranta is against it, and Cora writes about how she and Nora are now friends, then adds, "Friendship means forgiveness. So Nora, forgive me if I fall asleep when you talk about books or yell at you when you gibber and snivel."


* Any book:

** Give my students back! By Miss Hanover.:
Miss Hanover's college rival who has the Gift of Gaming shrinks the four girls down and puts them in a jar to use as living game pieces. Miss Hanover must best him in a game to win them back, using every trick she can come up with and all her knowledge of his psyche. (It's similar to Medaka Box when it went through that games kick and had Kumagawa challenge everyone to card games.)

** The field trip. By Nora.

The class goes on a field trip to the aquarium or something. (Shouldn't the field trip be magical somehow?)

** The card game. By Nora.

Nora invents a trading card game based on classical literature and sends the idea to a gaming company. The company sends her a letter saying that while they appreciate her patronage, they can't accept unsolicited ideas. A little while later, a trading card game based on classical literature appears. No one believes Nora when she says she invented it (well, her friends and Miss Hanover do, but none of the other students do). The game explodes in popularity. Nora just gets more and more sad because they stole her idea without giving her any credit.

Miss Hanover ends up driving Nora to the company to talk to the person that Nora contacted about it. At first they won't see them and make them wait in the lobby for several hours. Finally, the person who who "came up with the idea", along with his manager in the company, meets with them and ignores Miss Hanover's pleas to stop this and let a little girl have some credit. Miss Hanover mentions in parting that he misattributed the quote "For whom the bell tolls" to Donne when it was actually Dylan Thomas who said it; the 'creator' says that of course he knew that, someone in the editing department will fix it in subsequent versions, but Nora pipes up and says no, it was Donne who said it. Miss Hanover asks the creator if he can name one work by Donne and one work by Dylan Thomas; he waffles and hems and haws, but Nora names the exact work by Donne and quotes some of the surrounding text, showing the manager that the "creator" is a fraud who doesn't know anything about classical literature. (He worked in the mailroom, but he intercepted Nora's letter, sent her back the fake rejection, and then stole her idea.)

The manager says he can't allow this to go on and the company is going to discontinue the game. There isn't enough proof to give Nora credit, but at the very least they aren't going to keep publishing the game with a shadow over it.



** Untitled action-oriented story?
Related to the whole thing with Amy and Cora, I might like to do a story where some kind of evil spirit gets released somehow, and Nora uses her Gift of accessing weird hidden spaces to reseal it, earning her the respect of the mean girls that used to be mean to her. She, of course, does not abandon her real friends to hang out with the mean girls because that's how she is.
