* Series Outline

I want to have a guide for this series towards being done, because I don't think it's really that good. It has some features that I like, but it's kind of just what everyone else is doing. Still, exposure is exposure. Plus, I have a bad habit of ditching things I start. So let's get it done.

** Book 1
It's written. James meets Sophia. The basics are set up.

** Book 2
Mostly filler, but Langston is introduced and this is the first time we hear of Elizabeth Gault, through the meeting with her sister Mary at the sorority house.

** Book 3
Skip the filler stories you've got slated for now and go straight to the serial killer story. While investigating, James is captured. The serial killer has some technique for detecting the scent of a succubus on him and uses him as bait to lure in Sophia. She has also captured Amber, a weak succubus, and is using her to keep James in check by artificially inseminating her with James's sperm, which just sucks out a tiny bit of his life force (which he can recover). Latrom is also involved (maybe also captured?). 

Like I originally conceived, James is trying to find out more about Sophia, and Latrom (very unprofessionally) mocks his sexual prowess with regards to Sophia and says maybe he'll steal her, since she must want a real man. James tells him which bar Sophia will be at, but by pure bad luck, she isn't there and the serial killer is. She captures both of them and locks them up in a foreclosed house where she's set up home base (she also has Amber there, weak and starved). She keeps Amber pacified with a variety of weapons, including a taser, a baton, and a big machete (since Amber still has some regeneration ability); she hacked apart Amber's wings with the machete to keep her from flying away, and it hasn't healed yet.

Eileen Young, aka Lilith Queen, has been traveling around killing succubi and men who associate with them. She has a variety of succubus-tracking and -killing devices that she got from WAS (Wives Against Succubi), a secret organization of women who want to kill off all succubi. She's totally ruthless about getting what she wants, which is dead succubi, and she has no problem at all killing humans to get it. She captured Amber using one of her usual honey pot tricks where she follows a man who's been scent-marked, kills him, and waits for the succubus to show up to defend her prey.

Queen keeps both men weak by taking sperm samples and artificially inseminating Amber. This can't kill them, but it does weaken them, similar to a sedative. She also keeps Amber weak by beating and hacking her apart several times a day. Queen is interested when she sees that Amber's pheromones work on Latrom, who once tries to rush the door and break through so he can stop Queen from hurting her, but they have no effect on James. James says it's just because he knows Amber, but Queen says that isn't possible, succubus pheromones should transcend any reason he has. 

Queen has the basement split into two sections by a section of chain-link fence with barbed wire along the top and bottom. James notices there's a loose section in the barbed wire and a tiny space at the top where the fence didn't quite reach the roof. He finds a wooden stake in the corner and uses it to twist the wire around and bend the fence down, after getting Amber's attention and asking if she could break the gate across the stairway and the lock at the top of the stairs. Amber says yes, she thinks so. (She's strait-jacketed to a pillar and beaten, tasered, and chopped to hell, so she can't get over to the gate unless someone frees her.) James doesn't like the sound of that, but says he'll just get over there and free her and they'll figure something out. He figures in a pinch, two grown men and a succubus ought to be able to overpower Queen, even if they're unarmed. 

He gets over the fence, lets Latrom through the gate, and frees Amber. They go to check out the gate, but Amber can barely even move her arms as she is. She says if she had her full strength she could easily break the gate and one of them will have to sacrifice himself. James tries to find a way to get through himself, but Latrom, who's been infatuated with Amber ever since he saw her, basically jumps on her and tears her clothes off, and they're having sex before James can stop them. James asks Latrom if he has any idea what he's done and Latrom says James's limp noodle never could've satisfied a real woman like this anyway. James says that 'real woman' is sixteen, and Latrom doesn't care. Latrom prematurely ejaculates after two thrusts and crumbles into dust, and Amber snaps off the gate and also tears open the cellar door, only to have Queen jam a hatchet into her face as soon as the door opens.

James watches them fight, brutally, after Queen knocks Amber back down into the basement. Amber is blind in one eye because of the hatchet, and also enraged; Queen is calm and methodical. Amber flaps her wings around, trying to confuse Queen, but Queen backs off and uses an awl to pin Amber's wing to the pillar. Queen beats her bloody around the face with a baton and sticks her several times with a combat knife while easily dodging her slashes. 

James makes a break for the door and goes for the front door to try and escape, but he doesn't know which way it is and finds himself cornered by Queen in the kitchen. Queen wonders if this is enough danger for his succubus mistress to show up and James says she's no 'mistress' of his, and in fact she's ugly and smells. Queen asks him how he came to be immune to succubus pheromones and he says he's got no idea, and if she knows, tell him. Queen says if she knew, she would have treated her husband and son and they all wouldn't be there. James asks if she's going to kill him and points out that if she waits too long to get things under control, Amber will be back and will kill her. Queen says Amber won't be a problem anymore and she's not going to kill him, she's going to take him back down to the basement to wait for his mistress to arrive.

Down in the basement, Amber has been completely gutted, like a fish. There's blood everywhere, and entrails, and stomach contents, and other gross stuff. Queen asks Amber why she's fighting her, since when she first saw James she tried to make a bargain to join in the plan and get revenge on Sophia. Amber chokes up some curses and says obviously that went out the window when Queen chopped her up with a machete. Queen can't figure out why Sophia hasn't come yet and says normally she would kill James to provoke a reaction, but she's interested in his resistance to succubus pheromones and wants to keep him alive. 

At that moment, the lights go out, and Queen gets ready for a huge battle. Sophia has finally arrived. They have a huge, epic battle that's like a Hellsing fight. To James's surprise, June Sullivan is also there. Sophia wins (and gets to be a little cool while doing it, since we know how strong Queen is). She doesn't kill Queen, though; she instead offers to tell Queen how James became resistant to succubus pheromones, although she doesn't think it will help Queen. In return, Queen will give James an interview about her past and why she kills succubuses. Amber and James both think that's letting her off way too light, especially after she killed Latrom, but June says she owes this woman her life. She was the one who went to Sophia after James disappeared to tell her about Lilith Queen. When June was in her early twenties, she was raped in a bar and became a succubus. Lilith Queen came to her and told her they could turn her back if they killed the incubus and she bathed in his blood, and together they hunted him down and turned her back. For that reason, she won't let Lilith be killed and only agreed to help Sophia find her on the condition that she wouldn't be killed.  

The final bit is a transcript of the interview between James, Lilith Queen, and Sophia. Sophia tells Lilith that the reason James is immune to succubus pheromones (and in fact has reverse pheromones that attract succubuses to him) is that he was once a victim of a succubus, but that succubus was ordered to stop in the middle by the Tyrant. So unless Lilith knows how to find the Tyrant, it's no good. James asks how that could have happened when he doesn't even remember it, and Sophia says she'll tell him later.

Lilith keeps up her end of the bargain and answers James's questions. Her real name is Eileen Young. One of the women at her husband's job was a succubus and seduced him because he was a vitalis—a man whose energy supply is an exponential function of his years of remaining life, not a linear or logarithmic like most men. Knowing his son would also be a vitalis, the woman came to their house and seduced her son; Eileen happened to walk in on them and tried to stop it, but nothing can stop it once it's begun except the Tyrant. She found WAS, but objected to their passive methods of promoting morality in society and decided to learn how to kill, which she learned from the Malleus Dei and the Templars Reborn. (The Malleus Dei are like the Catholic Church's Iscariot in Hellsing; the Templars Reborn are more of an Evangelical monster hunting outfit. The Malleus Dei are also a lot more dangerous because they hire real military men and special forces, whereas the Templars Reborn are mostly cowboys and dirty rednecks who hate Muslims and Mexicans as much as they hate the supernatural.) She says with the number of people she's killed with her own two hands, Latrom's death doesn't weigh on her at all, and Amber was just another succubus who should die. James calls her insane, and Eileen says she's been called worse, then says he's pretty damned insane too, to be hanging out with a succubus like it's nothing. She asks if he's really going to post that on the Internet, and James says no, it's going on the ever-growing stack of crap he can't publish because it has to do with the supernatural. Eileen asks if, as a favor to her, he'd consider publishing it somewhere, not necessarily on a reputable site and without his own name on it, and says she'd owe him one if he did. James ends the transcript there, before his answer. 

** Book 4
James wants to hear the story about how he became immune to succubus pheromones. Sophia is ashamed and suggests making it a story contest, with each of them telling one embarassing story about the past. James tells Sophia about how he fell in love with Lucy. In return, Sophia tells him about how she came to this town once before. She was sent out to investigate a separatist plot. Sophia explains that she works for the vampire senate; the vampires are the most numerous and organized of the supernatural creatures, so they're the ones with politics. Ever since she's been involved with them and even back into the 17th Century, there's been a big debate between the Apocalyptics and the Cryptics (which James refers to as the Apocalyptos 'who really loved that Mel Gibson movie', and the Cryptids, who are forecasting a fortean future for all). The Apocalyptics in general believe that supernatural creatures should expose themselves more to human society; some think they should do this peacefully, e.g. through the UN, while others believe in a war and domination. The Cryptics believe in the status quo and want to stay hidden. Sophia doesn't really care either way because she doesn't have any pride as a supernatural being, but she works for the Cryptics since they're dominant in the Senate. In the mid 1990s, the Senate sent her to Donner's Rest to investigate news of an Apocalyptic extremist group gathering there and starting something. 

Sophia looked into it and found that the Apocalyptic extremist group had split into two factions: the Lopez faction, which basically supported being a crime syndicate and ruling a few of these towns to feed on the people, while selling drugs to maintain themselves, led by the vampire Porfirio Lopez; and the Didier faction, led by the incubus Denis Didier des Droit, which actually wanted to use the towns as breeding grounds for vampires and demon children that could be used as an army to take over the western half of the United States. She managed to sneak into one of their meetings and caught sight of Didier; to her shock, he was the incubus that turned her. 

Sophia was ordered by the Senate to withdraw and wait for backup, but she was determined to get to Didier, so she ignored them and tried to make a deal with the Lopez faction. Her deal was that she would use her (greatly exaggerated) influence with the Sentate to get them to leave Lopez alone if he and his men would help her take down Didier. She tells Lopez that vampires and succubi are natural allies, since they're both consumers; neither of them has much to gain from ruling the western United States since they feed on humans and are better off with a good supply of them, instead of killing off a bunch in a pointless war.

Lopez agrees to her deal, although he doesn't care that much about the Senate and is more concerned to have Sophia on his side against Didier (since she tears apart a few of his men when they first meet, showing how strong she is). They decide to storm Didier's next meeting at the YMCA meeting hall and kill him and all his men. Unfortunately, Didier has an agent inside the Lopez faction, and he's ready for their attack. He kills Lopez by decapitating him with a silver-plated cavalry saber. He then asks Lopez's men to choose between joining him or dying; most of them turn, but a few remain loyal, so they, along with Sophia, are given to a local branch of the Templars Reborn. (BTW the gun club that Kenneth and Brian were part of in Book II was an arm of the Templars Reborn.)

The Templars Reborn use the vampires as practice kills for their younger members. They try to do the same with Sophia, but Sophia sees that she'll never win since even if she kills her opponent they'll just keep sending men. (One vampire manages to kill his first opponent, so they cut his legs off and send another opponent to kill him.) So instead of fighting she uses seduction and induces her opponent to say he won't kill her. Theodore "Tex" Avery, the leader of this particular cell, shoots the boy in the head and goes to kill Sophia, but Sophia's pheromones start to work on him too, and he realizes she's not a vampire, but a succubus. Avery orders his men to lock her in the basement and bring in some of their womenfolk to keep a watch on her; he says they could do a lot of things with a live succubus and she's more valuable alive.

The Templar women keep watch on her and subject her to various tortures, some of them erotic. They run various experiments on her under Avery's command, including testing the limits of her endurance for heat, cold, thirst, and starvation; the speed of her regeneration and the effects of various kinds of damage. Sophia also hears how they commit hate crimes against various groups, such as Mexicans and Sikhs (who they don't differentiate from Muslims and just refer to as ragheads) and gays. In one incident they kill off a gay boy by kidnapping him and bringing him into her den to see if her pheromones will work. They set things up by telling the boy if he proves he's a real man by killing her, they'll let him go. The boy goes into the ring with Sophia (who is tied up), and she uses her pheromones to seduce him. Tex says someone has to die before anyone leaves that ring, so Sophia tries to just stay in the ring, but Tex holds a gun on the boy and says either she kills him or he will. Sophia decides that sex with her is less horrendous than being shot in the head and turns up the pheromones to seduce the boy into having sex with her. He dies, and Sophia's pheromones are proved to work even on homosexuals. Plus, there's one less fag in the world. (This is what Tex tells her when she asks why they did all this.) 

One day, after about seven years of captivity, two of the Templar women are left to guard Sophia; one is a woman who subjected her to erotic torture in the past, leading Sophia to think she's a closet lesbian. One of them leaves to use the toilet, leaving just the lesbian. Sophia uses pheromones and seduces her, convincing her to untie Sophia. Sophia then kills her, kills the other guard, and kills several others as she escapes, though she can't kill Tex because she's too weak. She instead runs away, into the street.

Her last "meal" was the gay boy, about five years ago, and she's been beaten and shot daily ever since then, so she's pretty weak. Knowing she needs energy if she's going to survive and escape, she sheds her usual morals and resolves to take the first man she comes across, which happens to be a fifteen-year-old James, who is spying on a couple having sex through a window with binoculars. 

Sophia seduces him and is just about finished when a girl with black hair appears holding two sodas and some bags of chips. The girl asks what the hell she's doing and orders her to stop and leave him alone. Sophia, against all known succubus function, stops and gets off of him, then leaves. 

Sophia asks James if he remembers this and James says he doesn't remember it at all. He knows that girl was Elizabeth Gault. She was a weird, disturbed girl who used to hang out with him when they were teeenagers. She was at the Catholic school along with him. She had once tried to take her own life, and when her parents asked why, she said she was so bored she just wanted to go on a trip somewhere. After getting out of therapy, she became a weirdo who liked spying on the neighbors. James learned about talking to the gossip hens from her; she used to ask them who was having an affair and then sneak over to watch through the windows or using periscopes or remote control helicopter cameras or other things. Her sister Mary, a nice, normal girl, used to play with Lucy and Sue. Sophia says that Elizabeth Gault is the Tyrant, and explains what that means: every few hundred years, a human comes along who has the power to inexorably command any supernatural being to do his or her bidding. She says it probably has something to do with the difference between humans and supernatural creatures that something like the Tyrant, which can take away the free will, exists for them but not for humans. Those who believe in God say it's evidence of God's preference for humans, made in His own image. 

The last time one existed was during the 18th Century, the reign of Queen Anne in England. He was a scientist and natural philosopher who foresaw the coming end of the age of mysticism and tyranny and the beginning of the age of Spartans!!! (science and reason). He helped the supernatural creatures organize for the coming age and withdraw from view, leading to the creation of the Senate and the rules. After his death, using his blood, the vampires divined the name of the next Tyrant: Elizabeth Gault. For a long time they were asking "Who is Elizabeth Gault?" but they forgot about her as they faced the travails of the late 19th and the 20th Centuries. Sophia suspected that the girl who was able to break the rules of succubuses was the Tyrant, so she did some research and discovered the next Tyrant was supposed to be named "Elizabeth Gault". She now tells James the second reason she came to this town (she tells him about Didier, though not by name, at the end of Book II); it was because she remembered encountering the Tyrant and a boy. She remembered the boy's scent, since she'd been with him, so she started there by tracking James down and enrolling at his school, which was convenient for her because she's always in school anyway. She says she has no idea why it happened, but it must be because of that incident that James is now immune to succubus pheromones, and additionally seems to be putting down something that succubi are picking up, since June, Amber, Sayona, and Sophia herself are all attracted to him. (Make the Sayona story a side-story.) Because of that, she claimed that she was investigating Joseph Austen, which was a lie, because she liked him and wanted to help him by making sure he didn't come up against an incubus unprepared. Sophia also mentions that when James first discovered her and thought she was going to kill him, she never could have, because of Elizabeth's order to 'leave him alone'. Hanging out with him like this might be just bending the order, so she can still get away with it, but doing anything to hurt him would definitely go against the intent of that order, so she wouldn't be able to do it.

James says she heard Mary before; they have no idea where Elizabeth is. He asks what Sophia will do. Sophia says she still has Didier to track down here, so for the time being, she's not going anywhere. James asks if she has any leads, and Sophia says she only knows that Didier was in this area back in the 90s and as far as she can tell his branch of the Apocalyptics is still active, although they haven't made any moves yet. 

At that moment, her doorbell rings. Sophia goes and answers the door. James follows her. Standing there is Lucy, holding a duffel bag, and a twelve-year-old Middle Eastern-looking girl. Sophia introduces her as Anira Levesque, a senior member of the organization to which Sophia belongs. Anira tells them she needs to talk to them.

** Book 5

Didier's plan for the Apocalypse has two components: first, he plans to create a zombie retrovirus (it's always a retrovirus) and infect the population with it to break down society and create general panic. He's going to release it in the United States because that will have a profound effect on the world economy and create more panic and fear. Second, he plans to get hold of the Tyrant and make her his puppet. He mainly wants her so he can clear out the zombie-infested areas, since zombies are supernatural creatures and can be ordered to destroy themselves by the Tyrant. Also, the Tyrant is immune to supernatural effects, which the zombie virus (Z1-N1?) incorporates, so she won't be turned into a zombie.

[Notice that both of the dragons have last names that mean "Smith", because of the fire connection.] 

Around the time that James met Sophia, Lucy also met someone at her school over in New York State. (It's actually a small town in upstate New York, not New York City.) He was a dark, mysterious transfer student with a British accent who chapped her hide early on by smoking behind the building and throwing cigarette butts everywhere. His name is Heath Faber. Most of the class ignores him because he's dark (and the school is high-class, so most of the students are pretty dutiful and not dark, so they don't want to associate with him, but they're also not going to fight with him). Lucy is the only one who talks to him, and she tries to make him reform his bad habits. 

Lucy has some pretty bad habits of her own; she doesn't really have any friends, always refusing invitations to hang out so she can go home early and talk to James. But unbeknownst to James, she also fights crime. She admits it's stupid and idiotically dangerous and that if James were the one doing it, she'd call their parents to make him stop. But her uncle and his wife (who are rich, by the way), although they're nice enough to her, don't really bother with her too much. Since they don't have kids, they figure she can figure it out. 

One morning while in the city, Lucy interrupts a group of Russians who are ganging up to mug an old babushka. After getting the old woman to safety, she takes one of them down using her jiujitsu and a second one with a knife as well, but the other one has a gun and pulls it on her, saying he doesn't want to shoot a girl, but he will if she doesn't leave. At that moment, a tall and handsome gentleman intervenes and tells the man with the gun that he'd better put it down if he doesn't want to get hurt. The mugger tries to shoot, but the gentleman gets in the way and the bullet stops against his chest. The gentleman tells the mugger his name is Peter Andreyevich Kuznetsov and shows him a tattoo on his wrist; the mugger drops his gun and runs off pissing himself. 

Lucy says that was amazing and asks why he saved her; Kuznetsov says he liked her ring and shows her his tattoo. The ring is an ouroboros with an emerald eye; the tattoo is the same, a deep red ouroboros around his upper wrist with a green eye. The ring was something she bought on impulse from a junk sale when she first moved to New York. Kuznetsov asks her to coffee, and she goes. It turns out that Lucy just recently finished reading Crime and Punishment, one of Kuznetsov's favorite books, so they hit it off talking about it. They make plans to meet again next weekend.

Curious about the tattoo and why it scared off the mugger, Lucy goes home and looks it up, and finds that it's the membership symbol for a certain cell of the Russian mafia that exists in New York, the Zmey Gorynych. She goes to the next meeting with Kuznetsov and angrily says he tricked her and he's even worse than those muggers. Kuznetsov asks her to explain what she means, and says after she's done that he didn't intentionally trick her, and additionally, he's left the Zmey Gorynych and has taken a job as manager of a farm that produces organic foods under the Maidenfair Foods label. (Because the food of dragons is fair maidens.) Lucy says you don't just leave an organization like that, but Kuznetsov says she doesn't understand their world; when you're like brothers with someone and you swear him an oath that you'll never betray him, he knows you mean to bet your life on keeping that oath. He and Fyodor, the leader of the Zmey Gorynych, are like that. Lucy doesn't totally belive him, but she decides to go along with it because she enjoys his company, and figures if he's lying, maybe she can find a hook to take down a Russian mob cell. Also, she goes to take off the ring, but Kuznetsov begs her to keep it on and says it's not the symbol of the mob; it's a symbol that they appropriated from older sources. Lucy reluctantly keeps it, because she really likes the ring. 

She continues her normal life for a while, meeting with Kuznetsov on weekends to discuss literature, until one day she has another run-in with Heath where she tries to get him to behave. Lucy finally gets mad and asks him why he's even in this school if he's just going to mess around, and Heath pounds the wall and says he's here because of her, then asks her to stop seeing that guy and runs off on his motorcycle. Lucy is deeply embarrassed, wondering what he could possibly mean by that and thinking there's no way that he loves her like it sounded. She tries asking James what that could possibly mean, but James just launches into a rant about how he's going to kill that guy. Lucy decides to muddy the waters even more by mentioning that there's another guy she's been seeing, an older guy, and she's not sure what his intentions towards her are either; she says he's sexy and dangerous in a gentlemanly package, and seeing him electrifies her. James just gets even more angry and starts ranting, so Lucy hangs up on him and calls Sophia instead, figuring she's a wise older woman who can help her out. (She mentions as she does this how pathetic it is that the only person like this she has is a friend of her brother's that she's never met face-to-face.) As it turns out, Sophia is sitting right next to James helping him study, but James is so busy being angry that he doesn't notice.

Sophia tells Lucy that it can be very confusing when you fall in love for the first time in a platitudinal way, but Lucy says she's not in love or anything, she just wants to know what that means. Sophia says it could mean lots of things, but Lucy says it really couldn't. It could basically only mean one thing: he enrolled at the school because of her. As for the reason, he could be in love with her, or he could be investigating her. 

Sophia hems and haws, and James pipes in and says to just ask him. Guys are dumb; they don't think about things that deeply, so you have to ask them to explain stuff like that. James adds that this guy sounds particularly dumb, so she'll probably have to ask him lots more times. Sophia tells her goodbye by saying "Good luck with Heath", even though she never mentioned his name, which makes Lucy suspicious.

Lucy corners Heath the next day and asks if he knows Sophia de Nuit.
He claims not to, but Lucy says she knows he's lying. Heath admits
that he knows her and that she asked him to watch over Lucy soon after
she started watching over James. Lucy asks why and Heath says he can't
tell her, but he will say that she needs to stop seeing Kuznetsov,
because that guy is dangerous. Lucy says she knows and Heath says she
doesn't know the half of it, but he won't tell her the rest and just
tells her not to eat anything produced by Maidenfair Foods. He also
asks her to lay off him at school, but Lucy says she doesn't care why
he's there, as the class representative it's her job to keep him in
line. (The teacher chose her for the job because no one wanted to do
it.)

That night, there's a report on the news about some kind of maniac who came into a mall and started biting people. The police tried to restrain him, but he bit the police too and he's now in lockup. Lucy thinks about things and how they just don't add up. She doesn't know much about Sophia, but she can't figure out why she would know Heath, why she would ask Heath to watch over her, and also how Heath would know anything about Kuznetsov and Maidenfair Foods, and how Kuznetsov was shot and didn't die when they first met. (He might have been wearing a Kevlar vest, as a former Russian mafioso.) She thinks back to things James has let slip in the past about Sophia—for example he talked about her sucking the life out of him when Lucy could hear. She concludes that Sophia is some kind of vampire or demon (as crazy as it sounds), and that Heath and Kuznetsov must also be. She quotes that famous Sherlock Holmes line about 

Kuznetsov calls and asks Lucy out to a fancy restaurant on Saturday night. Lucy agrees to go, against her better judgment; she tries to tell herself it's all to maintain an appearance of normality so Kuznetsov doesn't get suspicious and kill her off, but she admits in her narration that that's a lie and she was curious and intrigued and wanted to find out more about him and what he is.  goes and meets Kuznetsov on a Saturday night; he made reservations at a nice restaurant for them. Lucy says it's a little out of her price range when they meet, but Kuznetsov says don't be ridiculous, of course it's his treat, and she goes in with him. (Her aunt and uncle are pretty rich, but they're not really the upscale types; they're just as liable to order pizza as to go out for a fancy meal.) After a nice dinner, Kuznetsov offers to drive her home, since she doesn't live in the city. Lucy says the trains are still running, but Kuznetsov mentions the maniac from the other day who bit people and says you never know how many other people like that might be running around. Lucy says she can take care of herself, though she appreciates the thought. Kuznetsov says he would feel terrible if anything happened to her, and Lucy consents to let him walk her to the train station. 

As they're walking, a criminal runs at them. Lucy takes him down with a jujitsu throw, but several more people surge out of a nearby alley and cut off escape. It's dark, but Lucy notices that all of them look terrible, as they're dead and rotting, and they shamble instead of walking. (Some of them run, but the crowd from the alley shambles.) The Lucy took down gets up and tries to bite her, and is unperturbed even when she stomps on his throat. Kuznetsov sighs and says these scum ruined his evening, then takes out a stiletto and jams it in the initial attacker's eye. He puts on a pair of iron knuckles and crushes down the skull of a second attacker, but looking over the rest of the crowd, he decides it's not worth it to keep up this masquerade; Lucy is smart anyway, so she must have figured it out when he stepped in front of the bullet. Kuznetsov's hands start to turn into dragon claws, and his eyes become snake eyes, and his teeth become massive fangs, but then a wave of fire sweeps through the crowd, and Heath appears.

Kuznetsov says wryly that Heath stole his chance to impress a girl, and Heath says he doesn't know why a playboy from the mob would spend so much energy on a bossy jailbait Girl Scout. Kuznetsov praises Lucy to the skies, calling her a gentle spirit, a fierce intellect, a fine, modest, and adventurous woman, more woman than most women ever become, as flaming zombies march towards them. Kuznetsov concludes by breathing a gust of flame at the zombies. He wraps his dragon claws around the nearest zombie and crushes its skull easily. He tells Lucy in his true form he could dispose of this garbage with one flick of his tail, but he's not sure she's ready yet for that. 

Kuznetsov and Heath together kill off the zombies, and Heath says now there's just one more piece of scum to dispose of. Kuznetsov says to try it, and they fight for a while, with Kuznetsov coming out on top and pinning Heath. Heath starts to transform, but Kuznetsov reminds him that they're in the middle of the city, and Heath manages to get control of himself and stops, unhappily. Lucy tells them she doesn't really know why they're fighting, if it's because of her or what, but she wants them to stop. (Heath tells her to get over herself.) She says she knows they're supernatural somehow, and thought maybe they were vampires, but she never imagined they were dragons. Kuznetsov lets up Heath and says he's happy to be of service to a fair maiden instead of eating her. 

Lucy says after that, Heath stalked off on his own, though Lucy thanked him for coming to save her as he went. Kuznetsov takes her home in a cab after all. On the way, Lucy asks him lots of questions, but he says he can't answer any of them, except to tell her that those creatures that attacked them were the same as the maniac in the mall and to expect to see many more of them soon. (We're not using the z-word here, at least not yet.)

Lucy calls Sophia after she gets home and tells her she knows what's going on, that Heath and Kuznetsov are dragons, and she wants to hear the rest of the story. Sophia is embarrassed that she did something stupid like mention Heath (she's really a terrible liar), but says someone superior to her, Heath, and Kuznetsov is going to arrive the next day and she'll have that person come over and explain everything.
