#A Diary about my Little Sister

##March 23rd, 2014:

I'm writing this diary because I can't stand it anymore. I can't stand keeping them secret anymore, all these feelings I have inside of me. It's been three years and twelve boyfriends, and I can't deny anymore what I have inside of me. I know the name of these feelings, and I need to say it.

I love my little sister.

Not because we're sisters. Not because we grew up together, or because of our family bond. I don't love my little sister as a sister. I love her as a woman.

I know it's wrong. It's wrong on two counts: because we're sisters, and because we're both women.
