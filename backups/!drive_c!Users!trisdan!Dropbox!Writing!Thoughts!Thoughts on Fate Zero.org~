* Thoughts on Fate Zero, <2014-07-30 Wed>
** Episode 2
I discussed Episode 1 in "Unfair First Impressions", but Fate/Zero is going to be a long series with a lot of plot, and I knew from the beginning it would need its own file.

That said, Episode 2 doesn't advance the plot a whole lot. The fact that we're following so many characters compared to Stay Night makes Fate/Zero feel even slower to develop in some ways, but also gives it a fuller and more grandiose feeling, like A Song of Ice and Fire. In Fate/Stay Night, we pretty much focused just on Shiro and Saber, and we saw everyone else through them; also, we only had five real Masters (Shiro, Rin, Shinji, Soichiro Kuzuki, and Illyasviel) to follow, plus the Servants Saber, Archer, Rider, Caster, Assassin, Berserker, Lancer, and Gilgamesh. Only Saber, Archer, and Gilgamesh were really fully-realized characters; we saw a tiny bit of personality from Rider and Caster and Assassin, and only really got a few lines with Lancer and Berserker. In Fate/Zero, we have seven Masters (Kiritsugu Emiya, Waver Velvet, Kirei Kotomine, Tokiomi Tousaka, Kariya Matou, Kayneth Archibald, and a seventh introduced in this episode) and each has a Servant; all the Servants who've appeared so far are fairly deep characters in their own rights. So it feels like there's a lot more going on. 

Episode 2 starts with Rider popping out of a bookstore and smashing stuff. Waver gets mad at him for making noise, but Rider says if you just steal and sneak off, you're a thief; if you steal and smash stuff, you're a conqueror. He stole a world atlas and a copy of Homer's /Odyssey/, and makes Waver show him where Macedonia and Persia are on the map, and also where Japan (their current location) is. (Interestingly, in Japanese they pronounce it like "Makedonia". Either the Japanese got all their Greek pronunciations from primary sources or Roman copies, or some Japanese scholar of the classical world decided "It's stupid to wrestle with the English pronunciations when the Greek pronunciations are so close to Japanese to begin with, and more accurate to boot!") Rider announces that his intention is to conquer the world again, energized by his discovery that the world is so much bigger than the corner of it he ruled. He asks Waver what his goal for the Grail is, and Waver tells him it's to make those jerks recognize his skill and change their ways. Rider punches Waver and tells him that's too small; Waver, in turn, gets mad and asks whether Rider even has a plan to defeat the other Masters and win the Grail. Rider gets angry and draws his short sword; in a flash of lightning, his chariot, led by two raging bulls, descends to the earth, and Rider announces that he is Iskander, Lord of Asia, and that he was summoned as a Rider because of that chariot. Waver is satisfied and a little scared. 

Alexander the Great actually used horseback cavalry, not chariots. That was in the time of /The Iliad/. Still, I'll forgive them because it's awesome that they put Alexander the Great in Fate/Zero. He deserved this awesome treatment in anime after that pile of crap, /Reign: The Conqueror/, stepped all over his name.  I liked that Rider seemed to notice the same flaws in Waver's outlook that I mentioned last time. In a way, though, they're a perfect pair, because both of them have a goal of personal glory and recognition of their excellence, even if Waver's is at a much smaller scale than Rider's. But they do clash in some ways, so I think they'll be an interesting pair to watch as the story proceeds. 

Kiritsugu and Illya enjoy a walk in the woods and play a game where they count budding chestnuts. (Because Illya is "budding"?) Kiritsugu cheats by counting a "wingnut", a chestnut relative, but Illya gets mad, and isn't satisfied when Kiritsugu says he can only win by cheating. Saber watches through the window and comments to Irisviel that she didn't realize Kiritsugu was like that, and thought him a cold and ruthless man. Irisviel tells her that Kiritsugu is actually fighting for peace. Kiritsugu (and Irisviel, too) was shocked to discover that King Arthur was a woman, so much that Saber found it offensive; she asks Irisviel if Kiritsugu thinks she's inferior because she's a woman, and Irisviel says it's more like he was angry at the people in her time who forced her to impersonate a man and be a king. Saber says he has no right to judge her or the people in her time, but if he fights for peace, their goals are aligned and she can work with him.

The seventh Master appears, and he definitely does not fight for peace. In fact, he's responsible for a string of serial killings in Fuyuki City. His name is Uryuu Ryuunosuke, and his hobby is serial killing, as he tells his Servant, Caster, after summoning him from the blood of a man he killed. Uryuu thought he was summoning a demon using his family's old rituals, and captured a boy to feed to the demon when it was summoned. Caster lets the boy go, but then kills him from a distance, saying fear is tastiest when it's fresh and you have to let your victims believe they have a reprieve when you strike. Caster tells Uryuu to call him Bluebeard. (He's rather different from the Bluebeard in the /Fables/ comic book, though.)

In the final scene, Kirei orders Assassin to sneak into Tousaka manor and assassinate Tokiomi. Assassin sneaks past an array of magical burglar alarms and thinks he's in when he's attacked by Gilgamesh, who he thought was no worry for him. Gilgamesh easily overcomes Assassin with his Gate of Babylon. 

We still haven't seen Kayneth summon his Servant, which absolutely must be Lancer now since Caster has been summoned. I imagine he was rather put out when Waver stole his scrap of cloth and summoned Alexander the Great, so he may have been delayed. By the way, Alexander the Great was as much a Lancer as a Rider, so it makes me wonderâ€”if Kayneth had summoned Alexander the Great like he wanted, would it have been as a Lancer? 

We also didn't see Kariya in this episode, probably because it was mostly about people bonding with their Servants, and you can't really bond with Berserker. (Well, Illya did.) Or because they were afraid if we saw too much of Berserker, it would be too easy to figure out his identity. I'm hoping we can see a little more of Sakura, too. She totally got screwed in the 2006 anime, and while I know she isn't going to play a major part in this series, at least a little more of her would be nice. 

The cliffhanger was pretty terrible. After seeing Stay Night, we pretty much know that Assassin can't stand up to Gilgamesh. I figure one of two things will happen: Gilgamesh won't kill Assassin, and Kirei will lie his way out of it somehow, or else Gilgamesh will kill Assassin, but he'll also kill Tokiomi and team up with Kirei. But Tokiomi still has command seals, so he could stop Gilgamesh's betrayal. Another possibility is that Assassin is killed and everyone counts Kirei out, but Kirei schemes his way back in somehow. We already know from Stay Night that he ends up as the Master of Gilgamesh, so Tokiomi must die somehow. 

I think Caster and Uryuu are going to be the first pair to die. They're so evil and despicable that they're the only totally villainous pair so far; even Kirei, despite his dirty trickery and opaque intentions, is not so incredibly evil as Caster and Uryuu. The only question will be who kills them. I kind of think it'll be either Kiritsugu/Saber/Irisviel, or else Waver Velvet and Rider. It might also be Kariya and Berserker. The reason I choose those three groups is:

1. Kiritsugu, Saber, and Irisviel are the moral team; they would instinctively hate a serial killer and cannibal wizard pair. Also, they are the designated heroes. And Kiritsugu is an expert in killing magi using Muggle weapons, so whatever advantage Uryuu might gain from his unconventional background, Kiritsugu is the one who could overcome it. He would also be well-equipped to handle Caster, a magic-using Servant.

2. Waver and Rider are both eager to prove themselves, and they're already active in Japan. Uryuu and Caster are probably planning a serial killing spree, which will call attention to them. I could see Waver and Rider figuring out that a Servant is behind the killings and going after that Servant, since they're both chomping at the bit for glory. Also, I don't see Waver as being okay with serial killing, and Rider is a true warrior, which probably means he's okay with killing, but only in battle, man to man, and not in a cowardly way.

3. As above, I expect Uryuu and Caster are going to call attention to themselves, and Kariya and Berserker are also already in Fuyuki City. Kariya knows his time is limited, and he seems like kind of a hothead, so I could see him also going after Uryuu and Caster. 

But the writing so far has been good enough that it could totally surprise me. And of course, I don't expect Uryuu and Caster to go down easy. We could even see inconclusive confrontations with several pairs before they're finally killed; I could see Kariya or Waver going after them, fighting to a standstill, and losing them, to be killed later by Saber and Kiritsugu. We saw things like that happen several times in Stay Night: Saber fighting Assassin on the steps of Ryudou Temple, the first confrontation with Illya and Berserker outside the Kotomine Church, Archer's first battle with Lancer. 

I look forward to the next episode.

** Episode 3, <2014-08-01 Fri>
They did something I didn't expect with Assassin. Assassin does die. Episode 3 opens with Waver, who was hiding and watching the whole thing, trying to get Rider interested, while Rider watches TV and thinks about how much he'd like to have a B2 stealth bomber. Waver tells him that they need money to buy things like that, and Rider says they need a city like Persepolis to plunder and that this man Clinton looks more formidable than Darius. (Yes, they actually show Bill Clinton on screeen. I appreciated thisâ€”first of all, Bill Clinton is nearly an Epic Spirit in the modern Democratic party. Second, it was more realistic, and reminds us that the series takes place during the 1990s.) Although Rider starts out acting uninterested and talking about how all he wants is food and sex, he starts showing how sharp he is by questioning Waver on how Assassin died, who killed him, and whether he saw anything that could tell them the identity of the killer. Waver thinks it was Tokiomi's Servant, but all he saw was a flash of gold and a bunch of swords. He asks Rider if a Noble Phantasm can create more Noble Phantasms, and Rider says it's possible it could make infinite copies of itself, although Waver is pretty sure that's not what he saw. Rider gives Waver a forehead flick for his mistakes and says if Tokiomi's Servant made a big show like that, it's suspicious, almost like he wanted everyone to see it. Rider ends up agreeing with Waver that it's a good thing the sneaky Servant is gone, since Rider is confident he can defeat the three knight classes, Archer, Lancer, and Saber, and Berserker is, as Waver puts it, just a mindless machine. They go out to find food and sex and do random stuff, as Rider desires.

We also see Tokiomi with Gilgamesh just beforehand, where he acts humble and servile towards Gilgamesh, who is bored, but takes Tokiomi's advice to walk the grounds just in time to see Assassin. That implies that Tokiomi and Kirei planned things out. Kirei goes to seek asylum at Kotomine Church with his father, Risei, but it is revealed that the two of them have several more Assassins hiding at the church. Risei also tells Kirei that Caster has been summoned and Kirei says he wanted all seven Masters to see it, but not all of them did. We can assume that at least Caster's Master, Uryuu, didn't see it. It's also possible that Kariya didn't, although I bet Zouken has some kind of monitoring on Tousaka Manor. 

Saber and Irisviel arrive in Japan. Saber has been dressed as Irisviel's bodyguard in a cool suit and sunglasses. She isn't very impressed with air travel, and tells Irisviel that one of her abilities is to ride anything as soon as she takes the reins, so in a pinch, she could probably fly a plane. Irisviel has never left Einzbern Castle before, and wants to walk around town a little, so Saber takes pity on her and walks her around. 

Meanwhile, Kiritsugu has already entered Japan in secret. He had Saber and Irisviel come openly to reinforce the idea that Iri is Saber's Master; also, as Iri herself tells Saber, she was created (as a homunculus) to be in the Holy Grail War, so it's natural at least for Tokiomi and Zouken to assume that she's the Master, although Tokiomi knows that Kiritsugu is involved too. Kiritsugu's associate Maiya smuggled in his guns and bombs and also has a camera at Tousaka Manor that captured Assassin's death. She tells Kiritsugu that Kirei is at the church. Kiritsugu broods some more, remarking that his single-shot Walther is still heavier than Illya even though she's already eight years old, until Maiya takes him in her arms and they kiss passionately.

Irisviel and Saber end the day at the seaside. Iri takes off her shoes and skirt and plays in the surf, and says how fun it was to walk around town with a gentleman. Saber asks if she was enough of a gentleman, and Iri says she was perfect. Both of them then detect a Servant nearby, sending out a challenge. They go to meet it. We see Rider and Waver sitting on the bridge (the one where so much emotional turmoil happens in Stay Night) and watching over things. Waver isn't happy being so high.

Saber and Iri face off against Lancer. Iri says she can help Saber with healing magic, but not much else. Saber says it'll be all right, but since Lancer's Master is nowhere to be seen, there may be more to their plan than meets the eye. Lancer says it feels wrong to not announce his name, and both draw their weapons and prepare to battle.

I was shocked that Kiritsugu is cheating on Iri. It does fit his image as a "cheater", but I somehow thought she was the only thing he loved. But Iri tells Saber at the seaside that Kiritsugu seems uncomfortable with being happy; from other scenes, it seems like he believes he deserves dire punishment. So I wonder if it's some bizarre form of self-destruction: he cheats on Iri with his partner because he somehow thinks he doesn't deserve Iri.

Iri and Saber do make a good pair, as Kiritsugu predicted. Their scenes together were yurilicious. They seem to really be on the same page in various ways. As we saw in Stay Night, even though Saber is very strong, she's also kind of innocent; Iri, by contrast, seems to be innocent on the outside, but to have an internal strength borne from her ideals. 

Lancer in Stay Night was cool, and I thought he was robbed; he was just a plot device, first to get Shiro to summon Saber, and later to hold off Gilgamesh while being a tsundere so Shiro and Saber could escape . Lancer in Zero is even cooler in design. He's another Irish hero, although one that I'm not familiar with. His girlfriend (in the ending credits) is cute, too. I don't expect Lancer or his Master Kayneth to play too huge of a role (although there is a grudge match with Waver and Rider in their future, I wager), but as long as he gets some cool scenes, I'll be satisfied. 

** Episode 4 <2014-08-06 Wed>
The battle between Saber and Lancer begins. Saber realizes early on that Lancer has charm magic that lets him bewitch the minds of women, but due to her high magic resistance, she's immune. (Fate/Zero is a total sausage festâ€”among all the Masters and Servants, Saber is the only girl. And Iri is a fake Master. So this power won't be nearly as useful as it would have been in Stay Night, where, by contrast, we had more girls than guysâ€”Rin, Illya, Sakura, and Bazett [Lancer's original master] among the Masters, and Saber, Rider, and Caster among the Servants.)

Lancer declares that he's glad he won't win through such means, and he and Saber fight. They are equally skilled in plain combat, fighting to a standstill, but Saber is disquieted by how little she knows about Lancer. In particular, Lancer has two spearsâ€”a short spear and a long spearâ€”and she isn't sure which is his Noble Phantasm. Meanwhile, Maiya and Kiritsugu are covering Iri and Saber and trying to smoke out Lancer's Master.

Lancer's Master speaks and tells Lancer to use his Noble Phantasm. Kiritsugu is able to uncover Lancer's Master's position, but he's too far away to get a shot, as is Maiya. (By the way, I thought it was awesome that Kiritsugu was just going to shoot Lancer's Master. Because it makes so much sense! If someone had just shot Voldemort, the Harry Potter books could've ended like, before they started!) Lancer throws down his short spear and reveals that his long spear is red underneath the cover. Saber intends to try it by allowing him to strike against her armor, but it turns out his red spear can pierce magical fields, which is what her armor is. Lancer cuts Saber and Saber figures out what his spear can do. To Lancer's boast that her armor won't help her now and he hopes she wasn't depending too much on it, Saber casts off her armor. Iri heals her wound, and they have at it once more.

Meanwhile, Assassin sneaks up to observe the battle. Kiritsugu detects Assassin and tells Maiya he's their main concern, and to leave Lancer's Master for now. We saw earlier that Kirei and Tokiomi were talking over Tokiomi's weird gramo-speaker-phone, so they were in league to plot what happened in Tokiomi's garden (although we still don't know if Gilgamesh was in on itâ€”I kind of think not). Kirei, through Assassin, sees Iri and reports her presence to Tokiomi, who is surprised, since he thought the Einzberns only had Kiritsugu in play. He concludes that she's another Einzbern homunculus Master. So it seems that Tokiomi is now fooled by Kiritsugu's pose.

Lancer and Saber have another tilt, and at the last minute, Lancer grabs his short spear and cuts Saber's wrist, while dispersing her wind magic that hides her sword with his red spear. Excalibur is seen as it cuts Lancer's wrist; but Lancer's cut is deeper, and Saber is left unable to use her left arm. Iri can't heal it; Lancer's yellow spear can leave cursed wounds which can't be healed by magic. Lancer remarks that her armor would have protected her from that, even if it was no good against the red spear. Lancer and Saber now both recognize each other. Lancer knows there's only one sword so widely known that the mere sight of it would reveal its wielder's identity: Excalibur, wielded by the King of Knights. And Saber deduces that Lancer is the Knight of Fianna, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne. (Diarmuid was a knight of Irish king Fionn MacCumhail in myth; he used his beauty mark of magical charm to seduce the princess Grainne, who I assume is the cute girl in the ending credits. And Diarmuid did have a red spear and a yellow spear, though he was also renowned as a swordsman.) Lancer compliments Saber on her skill and says how honored he is to fight such a worthy warrior, and Saber returns his compliments.

Rider is tired of watching. He was hoping more people would respond to Lancer's challenge so he could go sweep them all at once. He makes ready to go down there and interrupt Saber and Lancer's battle, summoning his chariot and bringing Waver with him. As Saber and Lancer prepare to tilt again, Rider suddenly descends into the middle of their fight and cries out his name, Iskander, for everyone to know.

The battle itself was just a bit static, with Saber and Lancer frequently stopping to compliment one another's prowess as warriors, but the animation was amazing when they did clash. And as always with the Fate series, there was a lot more going on here than just a battle. 

It seems like Kariya and Uryuu are both out of it for a while. Zouken didn't think much of Kariya's strength as a magus, so he's probably trying to keep Kariya out of the fight until some of the more dangerous Masters and Servants (like Saber, Lancer, Archer, Rider) are out. No one seems to think much of Assassin or Caster, and Caster's Master is just a serial killer without serious training in magic, so Zouken probably figures Kariya can take them. (There's not much doubt in my mind that Zouken is making all the strategic decisions.) Uryuu and Caster probably thought pretty much the same, and Tokiomi has his own machinations going on, so it seems it's between Saber, Lancer, and Rider for the next while. 

I feel like Saber never got to be her coolest in Stay Night; she was always either hampered by Shiro's stupidity, or weak from lack of mana. Her battle with Lancer was cool, though, and I expect coolness from her in the future.

Lancer was also really cool. I read some terrible spoilers (not too severe, though) saying that Lancer clashes with his Master, Kayneth Archibald. That's probably why Lancer was so concerned with getting across how honorable he was; if Lancer is honorable and Kayneth isn't (which seems to be the case, although he doesn't seem to have the skulduggery of Kiritsugu), he might be concerned to make sure no one thinks they're on the same page. 

Of course, Rider stole the show by charging in atop his flying chariot and announcing his true name without even bothering to think about inconsequential things like secrecy. Rider and Waver are probably my favorite so far (with all due apologies to Saber and Iri). Rider is a lot of fun, and he and Waver play off each other really well. Waver could potentially have been annoying; he does bear more than a passing resemblance to Wesley Crusher. But Rider keeps him from getting annoying by flicking him in the forehead and putting him in ridiculous situations like screaming for his life atop a bridge. Even though Rider, with his red hair and enormous size, looks about as not Greek as you can imagine, his personality really does feel true to Alexander the Great and the Ancient Greek desire for glory. Alexander the Great was, of course, not just a good fighter, but also a brilliant tactician and creative thinker (e.g. the Gordian knot). So far we've only seen bits of this from Rider, but I imagine we'll see more. After all, he seems to be the one making all the decisions, and also, Waver wouldn't last without someone to make tactical decisions for him, not against hardened killers like Kiritsugu and ruthless psychopaths like Kirei and Uryuu. 
** Episodes 5 and 6, <2014-09-19 Fri>
After Rider rides down and announces his name, he declares that he's now taking applications for companions (just as Alexander the Great did in history, collecting former rivals and making them trusted lieutenants) and he wants both Saber and Lancer. Both of them, of course, refuse. Saber announces that as a fellow king, she will not suffer such disrespect, and tells Rider her true identity. Rider starts to make her mad by commenting that he had no idea the great King Arthur was a little girl, but before Saber gets to the point of attacking him, Rider calls out to all the other Servants skulking in the shadows, saying they should stop hiding like cowards and have a true battle of honor, like Saber and Lancer. Kayneth speaks and recognizes that Waver stole his scrap of cloth from Alexander the Great's cloak. Rider comments that he's glad Kayneth isn't his Master, because the thought of having such a coward for a Master sickens him, and he only wants a Master who can stand beside him on the field of battle. Kayneth says he'll make Waver suffer, but Rider says he won't let that happen.

Tokiomi and Kirei know Gilgamesh will never be able to resist a call-out like that, and sure enough, he shows up to declare that he is the one true king and that Rider, called King of Conquerers, and Saber, King of Britain, should bow before him. Berserker also appears, and Waver can't read anything off him. Berserker attacks Gilgamesh, who fights back with his Gate of Babylon; Tokiomi is afraid of him revealing his identity, and uses a Command Seal to force Gilgamesh to retreat. Berserker attacks Saber, still unable to do much with her left arm; Lancer wants to help Saber and put down Berserker, but Kayneth uses a Command Seal to order him to help Berserker and attack Saber. 

Meanwhile, Kiritsugu and Maiya are planning to act. Since Saber is in a bad way, Kiritsugu is going to shoot Kayneth, while Maiya covers him by attacking Assassin. Just as Kiritsugu is about to fire, Rider interferes and rides down Berserker with his bull-drawn chariot. Berserker withdraws, and Lancer is released from his order. He thanks Rider, as does Saber, who replies that he values honor and he hated seeing such a cowardly battle. Kayneth and Lancer withdraw, as do Rider and Waver, and finally so do Saber and Airi. 

Episode 5 ends with Uryuu and Caster in some kind of dungeon of torture. Caster is looking in his crystal ball, and apparently he thinks Saber is the reincarnation of his lost love. 

In Episode 6, Iri is having a fun time driving like a maniac on mountain roads (Kiritsugu bought her a really nice car; before, she could only go in circles around the courtyard, so she's loving this chance to get out on the open road). She and Saber are waylaid by Caster, who introduces himself as Gille de Rais and calls Saber Jeanne. Saber tells him he's mistaken, she is Arturia of Britain, but Caster insists that she's Jeanne and that his wish has already been granted by the Holy Grail; this makes Saber oddly mad, and she attacks, driving Caster off. 

(I looked up Gilles de Rais; he fought beside Joan of Arc, aka Jeanne d'Arc, and was in love with her. He was later accused of witchcraft and child murder, and executed, inspiring the legend of Bluebeard. Of course, he was accused by the English, who also hanged Joan for a witch, so it's doubtful he was really a black sorcerer. But this is the Fate universe; King Arthur is a woman, Alexander the Great is a seven-foot-tall redhead, and Shakespeare is a mage.)

Kayneth is pissed at Lancer, and gives him a dressing down in their hotel room. Lancer says he will defeat Saber, but Kayneth is mad at him for ruining his brilliant strategy. However, Kayneth's wife (fiancÃ©e? I heard fiancÃ©e from other sources, but Kiritsugu later says wife), Sola-Ui, says Kayneth's strategy didn't make sense to begin with. She gives him sort of a backhanded compliment, saying that he's a great magus who managed to add a clause to his contract with Lancer making Sola-Ui a co-master who acts as an auxiliary mana source, while Kayneth holds the Command Seals, but that he's acting like a weakling and not making good use of his advantage, and that now that Saber's left arm is out of action, she's not much of a threat and he can take her out whenever he wants. Lancer gets annoyed and says she needs to stop insulting his Master; Sola-Ui's attitude towards Lancer is much friendlier than her attitude towards Kayneth as she apologizes. (It's his beauty mark that bewitches women; the camera flashes on it as Sola-Ui apologizes. That could account for some of the bad will between Lancer and Kayneth; not only is Lancer not the servant he wanted [despite being awesomeâ€”but then, no one is as awesome as Rider], but Kayneth's wife seems to like Lancer better than she likes him. Then Lancer has his own bad will because Kayneth doesn't agree with his ideals, and you get two people who really don't like each other. Not that he would've been at all compatible with Rider either. He probably would've been better off with Berserker, who will just mindlessly take orders.) 

A fire starts in the hotel, and everyone evacuates. Kayneth is sure Saber has come back and sends Lancer to fight her, then brags to Sola-Ui about his magic atelier that's perfectly set up for a battle with other Masters. Down on the ground, the hotel staff is making sure all the guests are safe. Kiritsugu answers for Kayneth. At first I thought he was using a Jedi mind trick, but the hotel guy looked so skeptical that maybe he was just taking refuge in audacity; after all, they've got other worries. Once everyone is out, Kiritsugu orders Maiya to blow up the building. Maiya does so, but encounters Kirei on the roof and barely manages to escape. (For a priest, he's pretty good with those knives.) 

Kirei returns to the church to find Gilgamesh on his couch, drinking his wine. Kirei and Gilgamesh have a chat about what Kirei's wish would be if he won the Grail. Gilgamesh makes it clear that he knows Kirei isn't really out of the war, and says he finds Tokiomi pompous and insufferable. When Gilgamesh leaves, he and Kirei seem to have sort of an implicit understanding that they're going to team up and betray Tokiomi. (Gilgamesh is totally puzzled by Tokiomi's obsession with the "Root", which I assume is a new translation for what was called the "Source" in Episode 1. These two are almost as incompatible as Lancer and Kayneth.)

After failing to convince Saber that she's Joan of Arc reborn, Caster tells Uryuu they're going to enact some large magic, kill off all the children they currently have in the dungeons, and go get more. Uryuu is disappointed that they're now going for quantity over quality, but he goes along with it. 

Kirei, Kirei's father, and Tokiomi discuss Caster and Uryuu, and how they're probably responsible for all the child disappearances on the news. They don't seem to have any intention of going for the Holy Grail. Kirei's father says he's allowed to make minor changes to the rules and says he's going to ask the other five Masters (excluding the out-on-paper Kirei) to team up and put down Uryuu and Caster. It's unclear whether this should have also been done for Caster or Shinji in Stay Night; I guess maybe they get a pass since they were hurting normal people for magical purposes related to the war, and not just killing for the fun of it. 

I'm curious why Kirei's father is going to this trouble to try and unite the other Masters. I know from glancing at episode summaries that this plot takes up the rest of Season 1 and the first bit of Season 2, so it happens. But Uryuu is just a normal person with mental illness, and Tokiomi seems to know it since he makes a disparaging comment about him; Caster is the only fighter on that team, and he's also crazy and obsessed with Saber, and neither of them is expecting an attack. Setting aside the possibility of sending Assassin after Uryuu (if he dies, Caster hasn't got long either unless he allies himself with another Master, and none of them would let him be in charge to pursue his wacko obsession with Saber like Uryuu does), since that would cause lots of suspicion among the other Masters, it seems like Gilgamesh should be more than enough to take them out. He easily killed Caster in the Stay Night anime, so magic doesn't really bother him (I'm pretty sure something like that also happened in the VN at some point), and Uryuu is nothing to worry about. That's why I suspect this is some kind of plot by the Tokiomi/Kirei team. Tokiomi, unlike his daughter Rin, is very much a wait-and-see kind of strategist; he might be planning something during the confusion of a five-on-one battle of Master/Servant teams. 

I doubt Kayneth is dead, although he probably lost his wonderful magic atelier when the building blew up. I can't see him wanting to team up with the other Masters, especially Waver, though I'm sure Lancer will want to, since I can't see him being okay with Caster and Uryuu murdering children. I also can't see Kariya coming along. Even though I don't think he would be okay with murdering children either, he has limits on his ability to control Berserker; we see him cough up blood and worms after the battle with Saber, and say that his time is limited. 

Rider continues to be totally awesome. I really didn't expect him to be my favorite character when I started this show, but he is. Kayneth's chagrin when Rider was insulting him was priceless. Lancer and Saber are also really cool, and Iri is a surprising grown-up moe character. (They're so rare, even though being grown-up and moe adds an extra layer of moe. I guess that would get stale after a while, though.) I think Zero Saber is actually much cooler than Stay Night Saber, but maybe that's just because she doesn't have to babysit Shiro all the time and is allowed to be awesome. 
** Episodes 7 and 8 <2014-09-20 Sat>
Everyone sends their familiars to the Kotomine Church to hear about Caster and their new mission to destroy him. The prize for doing so is an extra Command Seal; apparently the mediator gets all the Command Seals left over from previous wars and can give them out to the Masters at his discrection. As I thought, Tokiomi was plotting; Kirei's father intends to send the other Masters to gang up on Caster and beat him up, then have Archer swoop in and finish him off, getting Tokiomi back the Command Seal he lost when he had to order Gilgamesh to stop fighting Berserker. 

Iskander, inspired by Saber and her cool suit, has decided to order some modern clothes off the Internet so he can go outside. He somehow figured out how to place the order, but the name he put down was "Iskander, King of Conquerors". The deliveryman asks him to sign for the package; unfortunately, we don't get to see what he wrote, but I bet it was in ancient Macedonian Greek. Waver doesn't want him to go outside and tells him he needs pants, and Waver isn't going to get him any. Waver then says if they manage to bag Caster, Rider can have pants as a reward.

Meanwhile, Kiritsugu, Saber, Iri, and Maiya are planning their move. When Saber hears that Caster is murdering children, she wants to run out and stop him right away, but Kiritsugu totally ignores her. He doesn't trust the mediator and thinks he's plotting with Tokiomi. Kiritsugu thinks they should just wait for Caster to come to them, since he thinks Saber is Jeanne d'Arc and will come. 

Despite his cool attitude inside, when he and Iri are alone together, he freaks out and asks if she'll run away with him. He says it's not too late to run away, but Iri says it is, and tells him he wouldn't forgive himself if he ran away and passed up this chance to use the Holy Grail's power. Kiritsugu fears Kirei for some reason; I think it's mostly philosophical, but in this episode we also see a little why he would fear to meet Kirei in battle. (Even though I would've thought he could just shoot him. Also, I would've expected him to be the better magus, and also the more experienced fighter.)

Iri senses someone intruding on the castle's grounds (it seems to be the same Einzbern Castle where the battle with Illya and Berserker takes place in Stay night). She uses a crystal ball to see Caster on the grounds, raving as usual, with a horde of children. He lures Saber out by releasing the children into the forest and chasing them down, killing them as he catches them; he opens by killing one just to show Saber how serious he is. Kiritsugu sends Saber out to fight him and tells Maiya to take Iri to safety.

Saber faces Caster, calling him /gedou/, which is translated as "heretic". She tries to save one of the children, but it turns out Caster was using him as a decoy bomb and ugly worm things pop out of him when he goes to Saber. Caster summons a horde of worm things and Saber cuts them down, but more and more keep appearing. They wrap up Saber and trap her, but Lancer appears and frees her, saying he's here to make sure they can end their battle honorably, and his Master wants him to take down Caster.

Iri and Maiya are making their escape, but Iri senses Kirei approaching. They agree that they love Kiritsugu (Iri knows about his weird cheating thing) and want to stop Kirei from reaching him. 

Kayneth sneaks into the castle while everyone else is occupied to try and pay back Kiritsugu for attempting to blow him up. Kiritsugu uses time-based magic to evade Kayneth, but his bullets are easily blocked by Kayneth's shield, until he takes out his special gun (I forget what the type is called, but it's a long pistol that shoots one big round), which passes through the shield and wounds Kayneth.

Iri and Maiya face Kirei. Maiya is totally beaten by him (he's strong, but some of this is also just her moving too slow and missing opportunities, probably because the script says she does. After all, he fights with long throwing knives and doesn't use any particular magic like Kayneth does, yet she doesn't just shoot him). Iri uses some cool magic and manages to tie him to a tree; Maiya is supposed to shoot him at this point, but she screws up again, and Kirei pulls the tree out of the ground and beats her up again, then grabs Iri and beats her up too. 

Saber and Lancer drive off Caster by using Lancer's GÃ¡e Dearg (his red spear, which can cut through magic fields) to cut through Caster's Noble Phantasm, his grimoire, after Saber uses wind magic to blaze a path through the worm things. Caster retreats, and Lancer admits that his Master is in the castle trying to kill Saber's Master, but he's in trouble right now, and Saber tells him to go.

Kiritsugu and Kayneth both know that Kiritsugu's trick with the magic-penetrating gun won't work twice. We see in a flashback that Kiritsugu has a special store of sixty-six bullets containing ground up rib powder from one of his ribs. He received them as a child from a rough-talking, blue-haired, female mage who may or may not be Aoko Aozaki from Tsukihime. These bullets, if they hit a magus's shield, will screw up the magus's magic circuits forever, making them short-circuit and possibly screwing up his mind as well. The more powerful the magus, the worse the effects. Kayneth is hit and starts drooling and coughing up blood. Lancer appears before Kiritsugu can finish him off and tells Kiritsugu that he could easily cut Kiritsugu down, and only Saber's honor in letting Lancer go to his Master's side without a fight has saved Kiritsugu. Lancer is awesome, so I'd like to think he could cut down Kiritsugu, but I bet Kiritsugu has a few tricks that would help him even against a powerful Servant like Lancer. 

Kirei deduces that Iri, lacking Command Seals, isn't the Einzbern Master and must be a homunculus designed to act as vessel for the Grail. He senses Saber approaching and hightails it out of there after stabbing Iri in the stomach. Saber reaches Iri and is very concerned for her wounds, but Iri is more worried about Maiya, who Saber says is hurt, but not in danger of death. When Saber goes to look at Iri's wounds, they've already healed. We see in flashback that just after Kiritsugu decided to make Iri publicly Saber's Master, he also put Saber's sheath, Avalon, inside Iri, just as he later did for Shiro. As long as Saber is within range to provide mana for Iri, Iri's wounds will heal quickly, and in this case they started to heal as soon as Saber began approaching. 

These two episodes were definitely full of cool fight scenes. I liked Lancer's part, and I was also surprised when Iri turned out to be pretty tough. I was a little disappointed that Rider didn't show up, but I expect he'll do something cool pretty soon. 

I'm, let's say, a little conflicted about Kiritsugu as a character. I think he's a good character as far as writing and his part in the show. He certainly looks cool, kind of like Spike Spiegel in a costume from The Matrix. His weird, empty eyes; soft-spoken, somber persona; and constant use of trickery and underhanded scheming to achieve his aims are very unique in a hero. But I don't know if I really like him that much. I think that was somewhat the pointâ€”to make the viewer feel very ambiguous about himâ€”but he's constantly on the edge of a nervous breakdown and can get too melodramatic. Case in point, the scene in Episode 7 where he suggests running away. I don't know if he's always like that or if Kirei is really shaking him that much, but I still don't really see why he fears Kirei so much. Kirei is strong, and I can see why someone with grandiose ideals like Kiritsugu, who's gone to such lengths and sunken to such depths to achieve them, might be horrified by someone who fights for basically no reason like Kirei. But I don't understand why he finds that more horrifying than, say, Uryuu and Caster. I guess we'll find out later, hopefully. I expect Kirei to eventually kill Maiya, now that he's had two tries at it and almost succeeded both times, and maybe that's when we'll find out the deal with Kiritsugu and Kirei.

Some commenters were complaining that Saber wasn't as cool as she was in Stay Night and went on about honor too much. But I remember her going on about honor quite a bit in Stay Night too. She just didn't have to as much because she had Shiro to do it for her a lot of the time, whereas here, no one in her group cares about honor, or they have more trust in Kiritsugu than Saber does and will follow his dishonorable tactics without argument. And I think she's much cooler in Zero. For one thing, she has a full mana supply from Kiritsugu, so she doesn't have to scrimp and save. (Though I'm not sure why she keeps her sword invisible in the battle with Caster, since Caster and Lancer both know who she is already. Ah, but I guess someone's familiar could be watching.) For another, Shiro was constantly holding her back because of his idiocy. Saber took some rather unwise actions in Stay Night, such as running off to fight Assassin at Ryudou Temple, whereas here she seems much cooler and more in control. I actually think the events at the end of Zero, where Kiritsugu orders her to destroy the Grail and betrayed her, made her bitter and reckless, and her frustration with Shiro, and later her confused emotional state over his love for her, made her even more reckless and careless. In short, Stay Night Saber was a reckless, hotheaded tomboy going through puberty; Zero Saber is an awesome, poised warrior who actually seems plausible as the King of Knights, King Arthur. (And if someone like Caster had appeared in her kingdom, she would have had a score of Knights of the Round Table chomping at the bit to go take him down.)

I still don't think we've seen the last of Kayneth. Even if he's a mess now, we know that Sola-Ui was an auxiliary Master, so she can probably take over in some fashion as Lancer's Master. (That's probably exactly why they made sure to tell us that Sola-Ui was an auxiliary Master in Episode 6.) Kayneth has too many outstanding grudges to go down like that; his thing with Kiritsugu might be settled now, but he still has grudges with Lancer and Waver to deal with. And Lancer now probably has a grudge with Kiritsugu to settle, because despite his dislike for Kayneth, he's still devoted to him, even against Kayneth's own wife. (This fits with Diarmuid's personalityâ€”he was a highly devoted knight to his king, Fionn MacCumhail, but his beauty mark bewitched Fionn's girlfriend, Princess Grainne, and although he never wholeheartedly betrayed his king, he did do it, and was hunted down and killed in vengeance.)  
** Episodes 9 and 10, <2014-09-22 Mon>
After the big fight in the last episode, Kiritsugu, Iri, and Saber somehow get the castle back into shape like, instantly, even though it was smashed apart during Kayneth and Kiritsugu's struggle. Iri has used her healing powers to save Maiya, but it's going to be a few days before she's back in shape to fight. 

Saber pleads with Iri to ask Kiritsugu if they can prioritize hunting down Caster, given her revulsion at the horrors he's committing. Kiritsugu, however, guesses beforehand that Saber would ask Iri this, and says the lives of a few children, or even a few dozen, aren't their top concern. Kiritsugu is going to hunt down Kayneth and finish him off. 

Meanwhile, Kayneth is strapped to a bed under Sola-Ui's care. After he wakes up from a dream where he sees Lancer's past and the incident between Lancer, his king, and Princess GrÃ¡inne, Sola-Ui tells him his Magic Circuits are gone and his only hope is to get the Grail and wish for them to be restored. (So he had no wish when he came in? He just wanted everyone to acknowledge how cool he was?) Sola-Ui says this can only happen if he gives her his Command Seals and lets her become Lancer's Master. Kayneth refuses to give them up, saying he now knows Lancer's past and that Lancer is hiding his true wish, so Sola-Ui shows her true colors; although she keeps talking sweetly, she starts breaking his fingers until he agrees to give them up. She then goes to Lancer and tells him what's happened. Lancer at first refuses to serve her, saying he swore his fealty to Kayneth, but Sola-Ui tells him she plans to win the Grail for Kayneth so his magic circuits can be restored, and Lancer reluctantly agrees, although he thinks that the look in her eyes is just like the look in GrÃ¡inne's eyes when she induced him to betray his king. We see Lancer sitting by the unconscious Kayneth's bedside, thinking that he wants to fulfill his wish of going back in time and keeping his vows to his king. 

It now seems obvious that Sola-Ui is totally bewitched by Lancer's beauty mark and will do anything to be with him, but I doubt she was a nice person even before this; from the sound of it, she married Kayneth just because of his family, and she seems to manipulate him pretty badly by alternately insulting him and stroking his ego. Kayneth knows she has a thing for Lancer and he suspects Lancer is going to mess around with her just like he did with GrÃ¡inne. Lancer actually has no such intention, both because of his deep regret over his past and determination to keep his vow of loyalty to Kayneth, and also, I think, because Sola-Ui isn't fooling him; he knows she has her own agenda and does not have his Master's best interests in mind. Lancer and Kayneth had their disagreements, but Sola-Ui is even more dangerous and scheming than Kayneth (who tries to be clever, but mostly just comes off as kind of James Bond villain-ish, largely because he's so arrogant that he consistently underestimates his opponents), so Lancer would not be happy working with her. 

Waver comes downstairs to find Rider drinking with the bewitched old couple whose house they're staying at. He sent Rider on a mission to gather water samples from various points along the river that cuts throught the city, and Rider got his pants so he could carry it out. Waver tests the samples, hoping to find traces of magic. He finds them in all the samples up to P, after which they cut off; he asks Rider if there was some kind of drainage pipe between point P and point Q, and Rider says yes. Waver surmises that Caster's lair is somewhere at the end of that drainage pipe. Rider asks if Waver could possibly be a greatly talented magus, and Waver says no, a talented magus wouldn't use such a simple trick, but Rider says it's more admirable to use a simple trick that can't fail to get what you want.

Rider and Waver travel up the water pipe on Rider's chariot into Caster's lair. (Even though Alexander the Great used horse cavalry, I can see from a story perspective why Rider has a chariot: the damned thing is massive, like the size of a helicopter, and he can easily carry himself and Waver in it.) When they get inside, Waver dismounts, and Rider tries to warn him not to do that, but Waver does it anyway and sees the mutilated remains of a child. He freaks out, and when Rider says he wouldn't serve a man who could remain calm after seeing that, Waver yells at him that he seems perfectly calm. Rider says he has to stay calm, because they're under attack. A gang of Assassins, including the female Assassin that seems to be Kirei's main agent, surrounds them. Rider cuts one down with his short sword, and the others retreat. Rider says they can't stay to investigate, even though it could yield valuable information about Caster, because the Assassins are still around. However, he uses his power to raze Caster's lair, saying it'll at least set back that monster a little. 

Tokiomi is disappointed that they didn't get the chance to see Rider's Noble Phantasm (they must know who he is, thoughâ€”Assassin was observing when he came down and announced himself to Saber and Lancer), but Kirei says they at least learned that his Master is a third-rate magus. 

Far be it from me to question the tactical wisdom of Alexander the Great, but it seems like razing Caster's lair wasn't the best decisionâ€”if they know where he is, but he doesn't know they know, that could be a big advantage. But then, Assassin's master also knows, and maybe they assumed Caster would have some kind of detection apparatus so he would know they were there and try to reverse the trap on them. I was also kind of disappointed that we didn't get to see Rider's Noble Phantasm (or whatever he used to raze the lair), but I liked the focus on Rider and Waver in this episode.

Episode 10 is a filler/fan service episode. (In the sense of "something that only fans will care about", not "nudity.") It follows Rin, from just before the war began to the present. To people who don't know Stay Night (a surprising number of Crunchyroll commenters), Rin is just some random loli, so they have no reason to really care about her. Some of them even thought she was going to die. I knew she wasn't going to, but I know that Gen Urobuchi likes doing horrible things to cute little girls (Sakura, the Madoka girls), so the end of this episode did surprise me a little. 

By the way, Rin was my favorite Stay Night heroine. I probably would have liked Sakura a lot more if I'd played the VN, but I think Rin still would have been my favorite since I like well-written tsundere, and she is one. (The Type Moon tsundere seem to just work for meâ€”Akiha was my favorite Tsukihime heroine. She was also a little sister, another plus for me.) Plus I thought her Archer was cool. And I loved the dynamic of her initial attempts to be a brutal, ruthless competitor conflicting with her inexperience and true nature. Even with Avalon in him, Shiro would have been toast without Rin. Despite that, I wasn't really looking forward to this episode because it is filler, and the Zero story is so gripping that I didn't want to leave the main plot. 

We see Rin's initial attempts at magic, and how her father Tokiomi nurtured her interest in magic, and helped her when she needed it, and how they bonded over that shared interest. He also teaches her the Tousaka family philosophy of elegance, composure, and striving for excellence. Even in the Stay Night anime, Rin always spoke with great admiration of her father, and we can see that she took all his lessons to heart, which made her somewhat unapproachable as a teenager. At school, Rin is greatly admired, especially by the girls, who she protects from bullying and helps with homework. Her especial friend is Kotone, a shy girl who is frequently bullied. (A stand-in for Sakura, maybe?) 

One day, children start to disappear. One of Kotone's bullies dies, and when Kotone herself goes missing, Rin decides to take matters into her own hands. She rides a train to Fuyuki City, which Tokiomi had her and her mother Aoi evacuate when the Holy Grail War started. Rin's magic compass, which her father gave her as a gift, goes crazy, detecting magic everywhere, and Rin realizes that the city has become a scary place full of dark magic. She sees Uryuu walk by with a child and thinks he's crazy to be doing that at this time of night; when she sees him go by again with two other children, she realizes something suspicious is up and follows him. 

Rin follows Uryuu to an abandoned bar and finds her friend Kotone unconscious on the floor. She realizes that Uryuu is using his bracelet to bewitch the children into following him. When Uryuu comes back, he tries to grab Rin, but Rin dodges him and then manages to destroy the bracelet by overloading it with mana. This wakes up all the children, who she leads to freedom. Rin leaves the other children safe with the police and observes from an alley. She is attacked by Caster (we don't see him, but we see his ugly worm things) and her magic compass goes berserk.

Rin's mother, Aoi, has driven to Fuyuki City to find her. Presumably she has some way to track Rin, because she goes straight to her and finds her laying on a park bench unconscious. Kariya comes out of the shadows and tells her he kept Rin safe. He has to take off his hood to show Aoi who he is, and Aoi sees that his hair is white and his face is wrecked, like he suffered some kind of burn. Kariya says this is the Matou family's magic and promises he'll rescue Sakura before she becomes like him. He says she's having a hard time, but he's doing his best for her. He goes off into the shadows before Aoi can ask him any more questions. 

Loli Rin was super cute, and she won so infrequently in Stay Night that it was nice to see her victorious for once. (UFOTable, the company that did Fate/Zero, is doing an Unlimited Blade Works anime later this year, so hopefully we can see Rin win more often in that). I also liked that we got to see what Kariya was up to. I have no doubts that Berserker is stronger than Caster, but I'm sure Caster ran away as soon as Kariya and Berserker showed up, so he isn't dead. And Rin's small victory is made even smaller by the realization that Caster can probably just make Uryuu another bracelet, and it'll be right back to it; although Rin saved one batch of kids, many more will likely die before Caster and Uryuu are stopped. (Especially with Waver and Rider the only team united against them. I guess maybe also Kariya and Berserker, but it seems like Kariya is playing a waiting game like Tokiomi, so he won't want to spend too many resources hunting down Caster. And he doesn't really need an extra Command Seal since he has Berserker, who obeys mindlessly. If he'd summoned Lancelot as not Berserker, they'd probably still get along pretty well, though. I can't see Sola-Ui taking Lancer against Caster, even for a Command Seal; that seems too risky to be her style. Tokiomi won't act until someone else spends blood to soften him up. Kiritsugu won't let Saber go after him.)

It's really interesting how, contrary to Stay Night, where the Masters summoned Servants with compatible or complementary personalities, half of the Zero Masters summoned Servants with incompatible personalities. Waver and Rider are rather different, but they complement each others' weaknesses and have enough fundamental values in common; Uryuu and Caster are obviously in sync; Berserker will obey anyone, and he and Kariya do actually go together. But Tokiomi and Gilgamesh are incompatible because Tokiomi is cautious where Gilgamesh is arrogant and hot-headed; Saber is honorable where Kiritsugu is pragmatic; and Lancer is straightforward and humble where Kayneth wants to be sneaky and arrogant. 

I kind of expect Saber to take up a rogue action like she was always doing in Stay Night and go after Caster. Iri may or may not help her; we've seen that Iri can be pretty hot-headed too, as when she tried to stop Kirei from reaching the castle despite knowing how dangerous he was. And Saber and Iri are much more compatible than Saber and Kiritsugu. In fact, I think Iri is the most compatible Master that Saber ever has, even if she's not really a Masterâ€”Shiro has too many ridiculous ideas, and butts heads with her all the time, while Kiritsugu just rejects her suggestions out of hand. Only Iri seems to actually trust Saber's judgment. I kind of sense some sexism here (definitely in Shiro's case; maybe just a tiny bit in Kiritsugu's case. He seems to respect Maiya and Iri enough, even though Iri should be even more naive than Saber). 

** Episodes 11 and 12 <2014-09-28 Sun>
Season 1 only has one episode left, and I expect it to end with the death of Tokiomi, which is heavily hinted in Episode 11. These two episodes are really talky, so I got just a little bit bored a few times, but the talkiness ended up developing into some really cool revelation both times, so it didn't bother me in the end.

In Episode 11, Saber and Iri are shocked when Rider rides up in his chariot with a barrel of wine, saying that he wants to have a drink with Saber and get to know her. They gather in the courtyard, sharing wine out of a dipper while Iri and Waver watch, totally confused. Archer also shows up, to Saber's shock; Rider says he found him wandering around town and invited him. 

The three kings discuss their wishes for the Grail, all of which touch on their ideas of kingship and interestingly reflect the cultures that spawned their legends. Rider says he wants to be reincarnated into this time and take over the world once again, starting from nothing. Gilgamesh says he wants the Grail because it's a treasure, and all the treasure in the world is his due. Saber reveals that she wants to change history and revise what took place during her reign. Rider is horrified by this, and gets deeply offended when Saber says the meaning of kingship is to sacrifice oneself for the weak. Rider believes that the meaning of kingship is to be a larger than life figure, a model for your people, to embody the very ideals of your people and land and give them something to strive for. When Saber argues that Rider's empire broke up upon his death and his heirs fell to squabbling, Rider says he may regret that that came to pass, but he would never seek to undo the history that he forged. Gilgamesh believes kingship is about wealth and status and power, and that to be a king is to be entitled to all the riches of your land and its people; he says his people must obey his laws, because he set them down. 

Saber's view of sacrifice is the view of a chivalrous, knightly, Christian king taking inspiration from the King of Kings, Jesus Christ, who sacrificed himself on the cross for the sins of his people. Rider's view is the classical world's view of a rulerâ€”a glorious figure, an aspiration, peerless in war. Gilgamesh's view is the view of the tyrant, a ruler in a world of god kings and pyramids and ziggurats (though Saber accuses both him and Rider of tyrannyâ€”and Rider agrees, although I think he really meant that a tyrant is still the kind of larger than life figure that meets his ideal of kingship, much more so than the self-sacrificial Christian view of Saber's). I find it odd that Rider is more offended by Saber's point of view than by Gilgamesh's, despite the way he responds to Saber's accusation of being a tyrant. Even though pharaohs and god kings are larger-than-life figures, they go totally against what Rider says about being an inspiration to his people, because they are explicitly shown as different from everyone elseâ€”they are descended from or ordained by the gods, and not even the greatest warrior can claim that. Alexander the Great inspired people, even long after his death, because he was a great manâ€”a /man/, not a god. 

Interestingly, I think Rider's view is closest to the way we view leaders in the modern US. US Presidents, in particular, are expected to be greater than human, to embody all the ideals of the people, to be peerless inâ€”well, not war, but many other things, including virtue. There may have been a time when Saber's view was held, but that time is no more; I suspect it was back when we didn't have paparazzi following the president everywhere twenty-four hours a day. Of course, some modern American leaders (especially in business) hold Gilgamesh's view of leadership.

Rider explains that his view is correct because it allowed him to rally his people to his cause; they followed him, gladly, because they wished for some of his reflected glory, to gain his praise, to hope to surpass him some day. (Which is also the exact opposite of someone like Gilgameshâ€”the pharaohs and god emperors of the Middle East never inspired that kind of loyalty.) He gets his chance to prove it when a horde of Assassins shows up. Rider uses his Noble Phantasm, the Reality Marble Ionioi Hetaroi, which transports everyone to the Persian desert where Alexander's greatest victories were won. It turns out his entire army became Heroic Spirits, following him in his reincarnation, because they were so inspired by him. His army rides down and slaughters the Assassins, with Rider at their head, mounted on his horse Bucephalus (showing that the writers were indeed aware that Alexander the Great used mostly horse cavalry and not chariotsâ€”I guess the chariot is so Waver can come along). 

Rider leaves, saying that he no longer acknowledges Saber as a king. Archer also leaves, although he almost praises Saber with his final words. Saber says to Iri that maybe Rider is right, maybe she never understood the feelings of those who sat around the Round Table, which caused what happened. I assume this is why her wish in Stay Night is actually for an entirely different king to be chosen, which she doesn't mention here. It is consistent with Arthurian mythology; depending on the treatment, Arthur was either so naive of human nature or so disconnected from humanity and focused on holy, chivalrous things, that he never suspected Lancelot and Guinevere's betrayal. 

In the final shot, we see Tokiomi and Kirei discussing Rider's Noble Phantasm and how it's fully as powerful as Archer's Gate of Babylon. Tokiomi says he has a plan to deal with the weaker Servants, and the way to defeat Rider will become apparent as they pursue that plan. 

The commenters seemed to think the Assassins were stupid to come out in the open, but I guessed (correctly, as it turns out) that it was part of the plan to reveal Rider's Noble Phantasmâ€”the threat needed to be great enough for Rider to pull out the big guns. (And I guess if Saber had dealt with them instead, they would have seen Excalibur, so it still wouldn't have been fruitless.)

Episode 12 starts with Kiritsugu in a motel room, examining his targets. He thinks Kayneth is out of it for good (which means he hasn't found him and killed him yet), but he knows Lancer has a new Master and hasn't disappeared. He also hasn't found Caster, but children are still going missing, so Caster is still around. Tokiomi and Archer have been lying low ever since the sneak attack by Assassin early on, and Rider and Waver are too hard to track since they go everywhere in Rider's flying chariot. He also doesn't know what Kariya's been up to. Kiritsugu is most concerned with Kirei, though; he knows that Kirei didn't know he was Saber's true Master until the attack on the castle, but he still made a point to hassle Kiritsugu by coming after Maiya on the roof of the hotel and at the castle. 

Maiya brings Saber and Irisviel to their new hideout, which turns out to be the house Shiro lives in later. Iri sets up shop in the storage building, exactly where Shiro later has his workshop. Saber notices Iri doesn't drive, won't take the keys, and won't touch anything, and asks her what's wrong. Iri admits that she has no strength in her hands and can't grasp or manipulate anything. She's purposely suppressed her sense of touch to try and save energy. She says she's going to need Saber's help, and Saber says of course.

Gilgamesh shows up for another chat with Kirei and asks him what he's up to now that he's out of the war. (Apparently being a bunch of different people is Assassin's Noble Phantasm, so as long as the squad was around, Kirei was still a Master. But now he's not.) Kirei says his Command Seals go to the mediator, but that if any loose Servants appear, it's probable his Command Seals will come back and he'll be allowed to forge a new contract. (The Grail will choose a new Master, which could theoretically be a new person, but it favors those it chose already.) 

Archer then says he thinks Kirei has found a personal definition of joy, which Archer said was the thing he was lacking in their previous chat. Archer asks why, of all the Masters, Kirei spent so long researching Kariya Matou. Kirei says Kariya's situation is complicated and required extra research, but it's now known that he's not a threat. Archer asks how Kirei would react if Kariya won the war, and Kirei takes a long pause before he says the question is meaningless. Archer says if it had been anyone but Kariya, Kirei would have known immediately it was meaningless. Archer says Kirei's joy is others' pain. Kirei yells that it's wrong for him to be like that, but Archer tells him to embrace it, and suggests that he find some way to stay in the war so he can win the Grail and ask it what his wish should be. Archer picks up the Archer piece on Kirei's Holy Grail War chess board as he says this.

Tokiomi's toast. I don't know if it'll be next time or in a few episodes, but he's done. It's kind of interesting; he ought to be a somewhat likeable character, but he's not. He's a good father to Rin and treats his wife well, and he's not a child-murdering serial killer, and he's even got cleaner hands than Kiritsugu, and his wish, while selfish, is at least not actively harmful. You can't really call him evil, even if he is unscrupulous and kind of an idiot about people. Though he is participating in a war to kill six other people for his selfish wish, and he even tried to cheat at it, so maybe that's what makes him not as likable as he could be. In the end, I think maybe it's his beard and his pretentious way of sitting around in a dressing gown with a glass of wine and waxing poetic. 

On the other hand, Irisviel and Saberâ€”I love them. Grown woman moe is the best. (Okay, elementary school girls are still the best, but grown woman moe is pretty awesome.) Their scene in the storage shed was almost as romantic as the scenes between Saber and Shiro in the later episodes of Stay Night. I'm still kind of conflicted about Kiritsugu, but Iri and Saber together redeems team Einzbern. I also still really like Rider, even though I was a little disconcerted that he found Saber's ideals so foolish and resorted to insulting her with names like "little girl". 
** Episode 13 <2014-09-29 Mon>
Episode 13 begins with Caster and Uryuu finding the remains of their workshop after Rider razed it to the ground. They are both inexplicably horrified and cry like little girls being murdered by a pair of psychotic serial killers, with someone (I think Uryuu) even saying "Oh, the inhumanity!", but Uryuu tries to show Caster the bright side. They have a discussion about God; Caster says God does not punish evil, and he knows because he spent eight years committing the most horrific atrocities imaginable, and in the end God didn't strike him down; he died because some other nobles wanted his money and land, so they had him executed for his crimes so they could take it. Uryuu says that doesn't mean God doesn't exist. In fact, Uryuu believes in intelligent design and irreducible complexity. He thinks God is a great author who finds their doings endlessly amusing, and that Caster is like a straight man to God's funny man. Caster is bizarrely comforted and decides he's going to keep playing the role of straight man for God. (Uryuu starts acting all weird and keet-like in this scene. He and Caster totally have some kind of weird bromance going onâ€”in fact, there are yaoi doujins that pair them up, which is really weird and creepy given that a) they're child murderers, and b) look at Caster! Look at those eyes! Uryuu even calls Caster /danna/, which is translated as "sir". This is like the bromance episode, because Rider and Waver's subplot is also pretty bromantic.)

Waver sees a dream of Rider reaching the shores of the ocean at the end of the world, Okeanos (the subtitles use the Latin "Oceanus", but the Japanese seems to use the Greek "okeanos"). He wakes up and decides to take Rider out for some sightseeing, possibly feeling some sympathy for him after the dream. Rider says he finds exploring a foreign nation's markets just as fun as conquering them; Waver says he finds that a pretty poor reason to invade. (On the other hand, it shows that Rider is actually interested in other cultures and peoples, and isn't just a mindless killer.)

Waver and Rider go to the mall. Waver is in the bookstore when he sees a book on Alexander the Great. (It actually says that, in English, instead of "Iskander".) He picks it up and reads a bit, seeing that Alexander wanted to reach Okeanos and that was why he pushed eastward and conquered everything he found. Rider finds him and says he bought a video game (it's some kind of tactical game, and he's been wearing the shirt of it the whole time). He wants to play it with Waver, but Waver refuses to play video games. Rider sees the book he was reading and asks why he's reading a book when he has the real Alexander the Great right in front of him. Rider says to ask anything he's curious about, so Waver asks why he isn't short. Rider is puzzled that they thought he was short. Waver also asks about Okeanos and is surprised to hear that Rider never actually saw it, since he saw Rider reach it in the dream. (Japan is surrounded by Okeanos on all sides, so he could now see it whenever he wants.)

On their way home, Waver says Rider is boring, and yells that it sure is boring to win just because your Servant is ridiculously strong. He says since he's a weakling, he should have summoned Assassin, and Rider says he'd probably be dead by now if he had. Waver says if that's the case, he should be dead, and says Rider probably would have been happier with another Master. (I think he could've gotten on more or less well with Tokiomi, although he's a little hearty for a man like that. Maybe also Kiritsugu, and probably Kariya. But if Kayneth had actually summoned him, it wouldn't have ended well at all. Rider and Kayneth are totally incompatible, and unlike Lancer, Rider would not have just followed orders.) Rider says if you're a weakling, recognizing that is important, and then shows Waver the world map in his atlas and says that's their foe. He asks Waver to draw them to scale on the map, then says it's impossible. When your enemy is something of that magnitude, it really doesn't matter how strong you are, it's your will that matters. Rider doesn't quite say that he likes being Waver's Servant, and he admits that if Waver's wish had been more ambitious, he might have been more willing to follow him, but he does imply that he's fine with how things turned out.

Something bad starts happening on the river. Saber and Iri are the first on the scene. Caster has summoned a giant worm beast to swallow him. It feeds off his mana. Rider and Waver appear and Rider says they should team up to defeat Caster. He says he also contacted the other Servants and Lancer agreed to come. Waver asks Iri if she has a plan, and Iri says they need to stop the beast before it reaches shore, where it can start stealing souls and will basically become unstoppable. Lancer appears and tells Saber he can throw his GÃ¡e Dearg and cut Caster's Noble Phantasm, stopping the worm beast, but first they have to expose Caster. Saber and Rider agree to attack first and expose Caster. Rider says his chariot can get him over there, but asks if Saber will be all right; Saber says she has the blessing of the Lady of the Lake, so she can cross any water. Rider says he wants her for his army even more now, and Saber promises to make him pay for that statement. Season 1 ends on a horrible cliffhanger, with Saber and Rider charging into battle across the water. 

Even though hearing Caster and Uryuu talk was sort of repugnant, it also made them kind of interesting. They remind me of Stephen King serial killersâ€”his serial killers are always completely bizarre and replete with weird neuroses and strange interpretations of the meaning of their actions, like Caster and Uryuu. I think they deserve to die for their crimes (and I expect they will), but this scene kind of gave them the next level of character development that they needed, especially Uryuu, who we really haven't seen much of, since he wasn't with Caster during the fight at Einzbern Castle. 

Rider is still awesome, and Waver is, to me, the most relatable character. He's sort of the Frodo Baggins figure of Fate/Zero, since Kiritsugu, the designated hero, is already a stone-cold killer. While it may be true that Waver has gotten this far thanks to Rider's experience and power, Waver has also played things smart in that although he knew Kayneth, his despised professor, was part of the war, he never gave in to the temptation to take him on directly, even though Rider could probably trash Lancer (as awesome as I think Lancer is, I have to say it). Some people in the comments were even saying Rider should be the new main character. He is totally awesome, but I kind of feel he wouldn't have the same license to be awesome that he does if he were the main character. (I always like the secondary heroes in shounen seriesâ€”Sanosuke and Hajime Saito in Rurouni Kenshin, Hiei and Kurama in Yu Yu Hakusho, Piccolo in Dragon Ball Z. Rider is sort of like that, if you think of Saber as the main hero.)

Fate/Zero is pretty much everything that was good about Fate/Stay Night to the tenth power. It took the whole first season to just revel in having all these cool heroes gathered in one place, and to develop everyone's personalities, backstories, and motives. Stay Night (the anime, anyway) had more of a shounen hero's journey kind of dynamic and never did anything with some of the most interesting side characters, like Lancer and Rider. Zero Lancer and Rider are both awesome and get to just be cool the whole first season, and we know enough about the other characters to look forward to interesting times involving Kirei, Gilgamesh, Kariya, and Berserker later on, whereas the Stay Night anime basically had villains appear from nowhere with no backstory. (Especially Kirei. I understand why, but compared with Zero, Kirei was pretty much just a random shadow villain.) 

** Episodes 14 and 15 <2014-09-24 Wed>
Regarding what I said last time about Rider and Kayneth, someone asked Urobuchi in an interview what would have happened if Kayneth had summoned Rider, and Urobuchi says he would have fucked both Kayneth and Sola-Ui since he was bisexual. (There's no evidence Alexander the Great was bisexual, but it was reasonably common in his time.)

Episode 14 and 15 begin Season 2, and they pick up where we left off with Saber and Rider attacking Caster's giant tentacle monster. It regenerates too quickly for them to expose its Caster-flavored center (eww) for Lancer to strike. Meanwhile, bystanders are gathering alongside Uryuu on the banks of the river, and fighter jets are scrambled. Two of the jets are taken out by Caster, but the third one is commandeered by Berserker using his ability to make anything into his Noble Phantasm.

Tokiomi and Archer arrive on Archer's giant flying platform/superdimensional space fortress Macross. (It has wings and shoots lasers! And it even does the twirly thing with the trail of missiles following it.) Tokiomi asks Archer to finish off Caster with his Noble Phantasm, so Archer throws some swords through Caster, which doesn't really do anything, and says he's done and that thing is disgusting and he's ready to leave. Dismayed, Tokiomi humbly begs Archer to use his Ea (the sword from Stay Night that lets him use Enuma Elish), but Archer is incensed by this. When Kariya and Berserker appear, Tokiomi goes to talk to Kariya while Berserker and Archer have a space fighter jet dogfight.

Tokiomi thinks very little of Kariya since Kariya abandoned the path of the magus, but he does explain to Kariya why he gave Sakura up to Zoukenâ€”because apparently if a magus has more than one child, only one child is allowed to inherit the family magic, but Rin and Sakura both had the signs of powerful magic, so Tokiomi sent off Sakura to allow her to gain her full potential as a magus, saying that even if he fails to gain the Grail, his daughters will succeed and find the "Root", even if it means they have to fight each other.  Kariya finds this reprehensible and isn't convinced by Tokiomi's argument that they would still have honor as magi even if one were killed by the other in the process of winning the Holy Grail. As Kirei looks on, Kariya tries to kill Tokiomi with his bugs (his worms can hatch into giant mosquitos), but Tokiomi is too powerful and he sets Kariya on fire. Kariya jumps off the ledge, where Kirei finds him, apparently dying, and, thinking back to what Archer said earlier, heals him so he can watch him keep suffering.

Uryuu is cheering on Caster from the show while surrounded by onlookers, in his usual crazy way, when he's suddenly shot in the stomach by Kiritsugu. (I knew Kiritsugu would just shoot that freak.) Caster gets angry at seeing this, but can't do anything since Kiritsugu sniped Uryuu from far away. Kiritsugu gets Maiya on the radio and tells her he shot the boy they thought was Caster's Master, and it looks like they were right. (So they weren't even sure? Damn, that's cold.) He says the only way they'll kill this monster is with an anti-fortress Noble Phantasm that can kill it in one shot, and Saber has one, but she can't use it because of her left hand being disabled by the wound from Lancer's battle. He says he hopes he can rely on chivalry once again.

Meanwhile, Rider tells Saber he has an idea and asks her to come to the shore. He says he can trap Caster inside his Ionioi Hetairoi for a few minutes and buy them some time to come up with a plan, but not even his armies can fully kill that thing. He says he'll send Waver a messenger when he's about to lose it.

Waver asks Iri if she has any ideas, and she doesn't, but her cell phone rings. She doesn't know how to use it, so Waver takes it and answers, talking to Kiritsugu (who of course doesn't say who he is). Kiritsugu asks if Rider can rematerialize things from his Reality Marble at a specific spot, and Waver says yes, as long as it's within about a hundred meters of where it entered. Kiritsugu says he's going to shoot up a flare, and Rider should rematerialize the monster under that spot. He also tells Waver to tell Lancer that Saber has an anti-fortress Noble Phantasm that she can't use because of her left arm.

Upon hearing this, Lancer says he knows what to do. Saber tells him her wound is a badge of honor and that taking it was worthwhile since it won her the alliance of Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, but Lancer replies that at this point, it doesn't matter who actually defeats Caster, it just matters that he's defeated. Lancer breaks his yellow GÃ¡e Buidhe, lifting the curse on Saber's arm. Rider's messenger arrives and delivers Waver's instructions. Kiritsugu goes out in a boat and shoots up the flare, and Caster reappears under that spot. As Saber goes to engage Caster, Berserker suddenly attacks her with his jet. (He used up all his missiles on Archer, but he still has his machine guns.) Lancer goes to fight him and knocks his jet out of the sky. (Lancer had to do something a little cool at this point, or he would risk losing his reputation.) 

Saber uses Excalibur and vaporizes Caster. Archer and Rider watch from the bridge, and Archer asks Rider if he still finds her unworthy when she has such great power. Rider says she has that power because she took the hopes and dreams of her entire people onto her shoulders, and that it destroyed her. He sums her up as a dreaming little girl who pursued ambitions much too large for her, and was cursed to live by her ideals, ending in her destruction, and ends by calling Archer the Babylonian King of Heroes, revealing that he knows who he is. Rider asks if Archer will allow his retreat, and Archer says it would be meaningless to defeat the King of Conquerors at less than full strength.

It seems like Lancer's final episode is next up. Even though Lancer won't win the Grail, interestingly, he did get his wish in a way (provided he never actually fucked Sola-Ui)â€”he was able to stay loyal to his Master and fight with chivalry. Even though Lancer is cool, he was definitely outclassed in this war by Saber, Rider, and Archer. But his lack of rapport with his Master was also a big factor against him from the beginningâ€”and also his Master's general incompetence. Kayneth is sort of the opposite of Waverâ€”personally very powerful, but arrogant and obsessed with baroque schemes, where Waver is weak, but does things in a simple and effective way. He has to rely on Rider's power, of course, but not even Rider's power could have saved Kayneth from his arrogance and complexity addiction.

It also seems like Kariya is going to start being a major force from now on. So far, Kariya has proven quite ineffectual (I'm not even sure he could have beaten Iri in one-on-one magical combat, given what we saw her do to Kirei). Berserker was able to fight with Archer, although Archer was far from serious, and he fought Saber, although she was already wounded and tired out from fighting Lancer. He apparently wasn't able to beat Lancer when Lancer jumped up to his jet, although that was somewhat situational. But it seems like Kariya and Berserker are both quite weak. I was kind of disappointed that he was so useless against Tokiomi.

Speaking of Tokiomi, I'm not sure whether to reappraise him or not. I still don't know if he understands just what Zouken isâ€”he seemed to still think that Sakura's wish in the Holy Grail War would be for the Root, and not for Zouken's immortality. I don't quite agree with Kariya's appraisal that he' s monstrous for sending Sakura away to realize her magical potential. The mere fact of wanting to see Sakura reach her potential, I take more as a parental feeling; Tokiomi wanted both his daughters to have the chance to realize their full potential and become the best people they can. He equates this with becoming a magus, since that was his path, and doesn't see how there can be any value in a life outside magic. That makes him shortsighted, but not evil; given that belief, he really did think he was acting in Sakura's best interest. But, if he does know what kind of person Zouken is, and still sent his daughter there, he's edging closer to evil territory. I still don't think he quite makes it, since he probably doesn't know the exact details of what Zouken is putting her through. I can't see Tokiomi being okay with his daughter being raped (which is what Shinji, and I think also Zouken, do to her in the Stay Night VN), no matter how much magic there is in it. He's an idiot, there's no question about that. He displays the same idiocy in his interactions with Archer, thinking that Archer will just acquiesce to his plans and not refuse just to be a pain in the ass. And because he is such an idiot, even if he knows Zouken, he still can't figure out that Zouken has no interest at all in the Root and won't raise Sakura to have any either. (He's not going to raise her at all, unless letting first a big pile of worms and then his grandson rape her counts as "raising".) So he's fatally stupid, and his petty attempts to be ruthless and brutal bring him further towards evil than Rin ever got. But I don't think he makes evil, not when Uryuu and Caster are the measuring stick. 
** Episode 16 <2014-10-09 Thu>
After Caster's defeat, Kayneth goes to the church and convinces Risei, Kirei's father, to give him the extra Command Spell, since Lancer was instrumental in Caster's defeat (by breaking his yellow spear to let Saber use Excalibur). Kayneth shoots Risei to guarantee the other extra Command Spells won't go to any of the other Masters.

Meanwhile, we see that during the battle with Caster, Maiya captured Sola-Ui and cut her hand off to make sure she couldn't summon Lancer. Lancer apologizes profusely, but Kayneth is angry and accuses Lancer of seducing Sola-Ui (and we can see during her capture scene that she's all enamored of Lancer). Lancer tries to explain himself, but Kayneth won't hear of it.

Saber and Iri drive up to their hideout, and Saber challenges Lancer to a final duel of honor, saying that since all the other Servants are tired out from the battle with Caster, they won't be interrupted. Saber and Lancer have a beautiful battle of honor, with Saber not using her left hand, saying it would defile her honor to do so. Kayneth is angry at Lancer for doing that while Sola-Ui is gone, but then Kiritsugu shows up, carrying Sola-Ui, who is unconscious. 

Kiritsugu presents Kayneth with a binding magical contract which promises that he won't harm Kayneth or Sola-Ui as long as they agree to its conditions, but he'll kill them both if they don't. The condition is that Kayneth use his one Command Spell to order Lancer to commit suicide. In the middle of his duel with Saber, Lancer suddenly stops and stabs himself with his own spear.

Lancer is incensed at all of them. As he dies, he screams that they all know nothing of honor and that when they fall into hell, they'll know the true wrath of Diarmuid Ua Duibhne. It seems like he was talking to Saber, thinking that she was in on the plan, but also to Kayneth and Sola-Ui, and of course to Kiritsugu. 

Kayneth sits broken in his wheelchair, cradling the unconscious Sola-Ui. With Lancer dead, Kiritsugu can't kill Kayneth or Sola-Ui. However, Maiya can; she shoots Kayneth and Sola-Ui from the rooftop. As he lays dying, Kayneth asks Kiritsugu to finish him, and Kiritsugu says he can't, since he's contractually obliged. Saber instead finishes him off as she comes to confront Kiritsugu over what happened. She yells that she believed in the words of Irisviel and thought she and Kiritsugu had the same goals, even if their methods differed, but no wish borne out of this kind of treachery could ever realize peace, and it makes her ill to think that if she wins the Grail, she'll have to hand it over to a man like him. Kiritsugu is just going to ignore her and run off like always, but Iri, also horrified, demands that he answer Saber. Kiritsugu instead addresses Iri, commenting that she's never seen how he kills, but Iri says he needs to tell Saber, not her. Kiritsugu tells Saber that he despises Heroic Spirits, because they're murderers who prattle on about honor and glory and convince young men to go to war in order to be like them. He used the best tool for the job, a Heroic Spirit, but he hates them. Saber objects that without honor, every war would raze the entire earth, and Kiritsugu comments cynically that Saber prefers war to hell. He runs off, and once he's gone, Iri collapses into Saber's arms, apparently too weak to stand.

I guess this is how the last part of Fate/Zero is going to be. It always had this dark undercurrent where you knew that most of the Masters were really pretty bad people (all except Waver and Kariya), but now it's come to the fore. Kayneth and Sola-Ui weren't very good people, but they weren't as ruthless or brutal as Kiritsugu, and he took advantage of their arrogance and complacency and internal conflicts and utterly destroyed them. I expect he killed them mostly because of his ruthless total war philosophy, because once Lancer was dead, they were just a cripple with no magic and a one-handed woman; even if they'd managed to find a free Servant to make a pact with, they would hardly be a big threat. He tells Saber he made sure to kill Lancer because if he just killed Kayneth and left Lancer alive, Lancer could have teamed up with another Master. In Stay Night, Kirei controlled two Servants, Gilgamesh and Cu Cullain Lancer, and it's possible that someone else, like Waver or Kariya (I can't see Lancer teaming up with Tokiomi or Kirei) could have taken him in as a second Servant. Also, Kirei is still around as an unattached Master, so it was possible he could have teamed up with Lancer. 

If Iri can't act as Saber's Master anymore, then Kiritsugu will have to take over (or have her pretend to be unattached), but Saber now hates him because of his dirty tricks. I mentioned earlier that Gen Urobuchi likes to do horrible things to cute little girls, but I expect here he's going to do something horrible to a cute grown woman. (And maybe also to her daughter, Illya, a cute little girl.)

We also saw Kirei save Kariya and lay him outside the door of the Matou mansion, thinking as he walked away that even though he saved a man who will surely seek revenge on his master, Tokiomi, he somehow feels exhilarated. 

It seems the next few episodes are going to focus on Kiritsugu's past. So far the writing in Fate/Zero has been really good, so I don't know how much I need to worry about this, but I hope it isn't going to be just some info dump that gives a Freudian excuse for Kiritsugu being the way he is. For one thing, I think I already pretty much understand the kinds of things someone could see in modern war that would make them like Kiritsugu, so desperate to end war that he's prepared to sink to any depths to do it. Even just hearing about it on the news is enough to make me understand Kiritsugu's point of view. I expect we'll see how he became a magus, and I hope that we'll get to see how he and Iri first met.  
** Episode 17 <2014-10-10 Fri>
Somehow, it felt like not much happened in this episode, even though it was pretty packed with content. I think maybe we're getting to a point where the scenes are more lip-flappy (the end of Season 1 was pretty lip-flappy), so it feels like a lot less happens; even though each event in an episode is pretty significant, there are a lot fewer of them, so it feels like less is going on. Plus, we've lost two teamsâ€”Uryuu and Caster, and Lancer, Kayneth, and Sola-uiâ€”so there are fewer actors that we're following.

After Iri collapsed, Saber got her back to the workshop and put her on the magic circle to help her regenerate. Iri wakes up the next morning and apologizes for worrying Saber, and they hold hands and look soulfully into each others' eyes, declaring their love, and they slowly kiss...not. But the scene was a bit shoujo ai (otona no onna ai?) and extremely cute. I love the dynamic between Iri and Saber. I can see us heading for Iri's death, which I think is going to embitter Kiritsugu even more, but I think Saber is going to be equally torn up by it. There were two people that Saber really liked and respected in this war: Lancer, and Iri. (I think she also respects Rider, but their clashing ideals and Rider's constant attempts to recruit her for his army make him harder for her to like.) Lancer died thinking that Saber had betrayed him in a horrible way. If Iri dies, Saber will have no one left in this world, and she'll be stuck with Kiritsugu and Maiya, with nothing to look forward to except for winning the Grail, which she now believes will turn out disatrously because she doesn't think Kiritsugu's ends justify his means.

Maiya comes in and says that Tokiomi Tousaka wants to make an alliance with them. Iri thinks the idea is completely absurd and that he just wants to trick them with a fake alliance so he can deal with Berserker and Rider, figuring the Einzbern team would be the easiest to convince. However, she decides to meet with him, seeing an opportunity to get Kirei out of things, since she knows that Kirei works for Tokiomi. 

Kirei discovers his father dead on the floor where Kayneth shot him. He takes his father's final gift, the extra Command Spells (that probably explains how he was able to keep Archer around for ten years, into the Stay Night era, and also how he took control of Lancer). Tokiomi is deeply disturbed by this news. As Kirei leaves, Archer appears and notes how calm he is, surmising that Kirei wanted to be the one to kill his father and now he's been robbed of the opportunity. 

Tokiomi goes to see Aoi and Rin, who is delighted to see him. He seems to know that his end is near, and he greets Rin by telling her that she will achieve the Root and that she needs to train hard. He gives her a book (written in Hebrew) and says goodbye.

Iri, Maiya, and Saber confront Tokiomi, Kirei, and Archer at the Kotomine Church. Tokiomi makes a big speech about how the fact that the representatives of the three great families all remain, showing their superiority. He says he he thinks the Einzbern family will agree that an outsider (Waver) can't be allowed to win the Grail, and proposes an alliance, until Berserker and Rider are defeated. Iri says the idea is absurd, but she's willing to declare a temporary truce where the Tousaka and Einzbern teams agree not to attack each other until Rider and Berserker are defeated. She has two conditions: first, she wants all the information Tokiomi has on Rider's Master. Tokiomi agrees right away. Second, she wants Kirei on a plane out of the war zone. When Tokiomi asks why, Iri says she knows Kirei was helping Tokiomi cheat, and she doesn't trust him. Tokiomi agrees to that condition as well.

Kiritsugu has gotten Saber a motorcycle, which Saber says is easier for her than the car because it's more like a horse. She goes on ahead while Maiya drives Iri in the car. Iri loses control and collapses, leaning on Maiya as they drive away. She explains to Maiya that she's a homunculus, created to act as a vessel for the Grail, since the three families wanted the Grail vessel to have an instinct for self-preservation and so put it in a human form. Her body should have given out long ago, but Avalon, Saber's scabbard, has been maintaining her. However, when Saber is far away, her condition worsens.

Kirei is packing, when he receives a call telling him where Iri and Saber are hiding out. Gilgamesh appears and asks him if he's really going to leave. Kirei says he doesn't know yet what he's going to do, but he shows Archer that he has all the Command Spells and regrets that there are no free Servants. Kirei reveals to Archer that the only way to find the Root that Tokiomi wishes for is for all seven Servants to die; Tokiomi wanted an extra Command Spell so badly because he needs to order Archer to commit suicide when the Grail manifests. Archer is angry that all of Tokiomi's loyalty was fake (who could be loyal to that jerk? Then again, I guess if he understood that, he wouldn't be who he is). But then he laughs, saying that finally that tiresome man will provide him with some amusement, and that soon, there just might be a free Servant for Kirei to make a pact with. Kirei asks if Archer is really okay serving someone like him, and Archer says that Kirei is at least interesting. 

Tokiomi has a final drink with Kirei and noticing how late it is, says he'd better let Kirei go so Kirei won't miss his plane. He tells Kirei he was proud to have him as a student, and gives him a letter which constitutes his will: if anything happens to him, he wants Kirei to become Rin's legal guardian and to complete her magic training. (What about Aoi? I understand the magic training thing, but why can't Rin's mother still be her guardian while that's going on? Unless Tokiomi suspects something is about to happen to her too.) He also gives Kirei a gift: an Azoth dagger, proof that Kirei has mastered the Tousaka style of magic.

As Kirei follows Tokiomi out of the room, he stabs Tokiomi in the back with the Azoth dagger. After Tokiomi dies, Archer appears and comments on the stupid expression on his face. Kirei says he probably didn't expect to be killed when he was in his own house and had a Servant right next to him.

I actually think Tokiomi was not such a bad person. Sure, he was self-absorbed and elitist and wasn't above cheating, but he was also a pretty good father to Rin, and I do think he thought he was being a good father to Sakura. Also, his cheating kind of has a different dimension to it when you consider that he believed, first of all, that finding the Root was the sincerest wish of all mages, and that it was so important that he didn't even care if he personally won the war, as long as someone found the root. In that respect he's more of a somewhat misguided scientist than an evil supervillain. Second, he believed that any Master whose wish wasn't the Root was going to do something horrible to the world (and in some cases, like Uryuu, he was almost certainly right to think this). So in his mind, his cheating was accomplishing an important breakthrough and also preventing whatever damage the other Masters might have done with their wishes. I have to say that, in most ways, he's not a significantly worse person than Kiritsugu, even if he is much harder to admire or sympathize with. Also, he seemed to feel at least a little sorry for the wreck that Kariya had become, even as he was full of contempt for Kariya's betrayal of his magus heritage; he said something along these lines when he tried to kill Kariya (which Kirei saved Kariya from). Come to think of it, maybe he does kind of understand what Zouken is putting Sakura through; he didn't seem surprised when he saw Kariya's worm magic, just kind of grossed out. That's a point in his disfavor, but I'm sure his elitism is enough for him to justify that it's the best thing for Sakura. 

But he was a chronically bad judge of character, severely misjudging both Kirei and Archer. He wasn't a complete idiot; unlike Kayneth, who was always convinced he was on top of things and his overwhelming awesomeness was going to crush all opposition, Tokiomi recognized that his plans were going south in a lot of ways. When he begged Archer to use Ea to finish Caster and Archer refused, Tokiomi wondered to himself why all of his plans seemed to be going so wrong. He knew things were going bad, but he was in too deep to back out, so he tried to make it work. I think his attempt to make an alliance with Iri was because of that; he felt his position was too weak since he and Archer were so out of sync. He also knows that Rider and Saber are the two most powerful Servants in the war aside from Gilgamesh, and that they've worked together before, when they fought against Caster. He may have perceived some danger of Rider and Saber teaming up to finish off him and Kariya. All four people involved: Iri, Waver, Rider, and Saber (leaving Kiritsugu out for now) are honest enough to make an alliance like that work. Rider and Saber would probably love to team up and then finish things with a duel of honor to decide who wins the Grail. Of course, if it had happened, Kiritsugu would have ended up killing both Rider and Waver in some horrible way, like he did with Kayneth and Sola-Ui and Lancer. He probably had some degree of pesonal animosity towards Kayneth that he wouldn't towards Waver, but I doubt that would stop him. In any case, Tokiomi may have feared this. He may have even feared that Iri and Kariya would team up. Tokiomi couldn't team up with Kariya, who despises him, and he wouldn't team up with Waver, who isn't aristocratic enough for him, so that pretty much left Iri and Saber. (On the other hand, maybe that's giving him too much credit, since he was such an awful judge of character.)

In any case, I still think he's a lot like Rin: he tries to spin schemes and be ruthless and brutal, but he's really a fairly nice person at heart. The way he treated Kirei just before he was killed, plus his scenes with Rin, convinced me that he does actually like people, and he seems to enjoy teaching magic. (He should have been a teacher alongside Kayneth. He probably also would have reacted badly to Waver's essay, though.) Unfortunately, his front of ruthlessness put him in bed with some truly ruthless people, who saw him as being in the way of their goals. Rin was a little bit lucky and a little bit better at judging people than Tokiomi was. The point where she refuses an alliance with Shinji because she finds Shiro more trustworthy illustrates, I think, the key difference between Rin and Tokiomi. Even though Shiro was basically useless, and his uselessness was hampering Saber, Rin didn't make the alliance that brought more power into her corner; she made the alliance with the person she could trust. She was smart to realize that Shiro's uselessness made him dependent on her, which made him unlikely to betray her. (And as we saw, he had several opportunities: both Shinji and Illya offered to make an alliance with him if he would betray Rin. But he didn't, even though he probably could have sailed through the war with no worries with Illya on his side, given Berserker's overwhelming power.)  

In any case, Iri correctly identified that the only Master who posed a threat to Kiritsugu was Kirei, and tried to use the alliance with Tokiomi to get him away. Kirei now being teamed up with Gilgamesh, the most powerful Servant in the war, is sort of a nightmare scenario for them. I don't think that this will end up happening, but the smartest thing might be for Iri and Kiritsugu to go to Waver and Kariya and ask to team up against Kirei and Gilgamesh. I know even if it does happen (which I doubt), it doesn't work, because the final battle comes down to Saber and Kiritsugu versus Archer and Kirei. 

The next few episodes focus on Kiritsugu's past. I guess after that, Kirei and Archer will make some kind of attack on the house. It may even be that they kill Iri before she dies naturally, giving Saber and Kiritsugu even more reason to hate them. 
** Episode 18 <2014-10-11 Sat>
This is part 1 of a duology of Kiritsugu's past. The commenters seemed to find this episode a lot cooler than I did. Not that it was bad, but I'm still not seeing why we needed this whole info dump about Kiritsugu's past (apparently it was in the novels, which, by the way, I might read after I finish the series, just for the hell of it). According to one comment, Kiritsugu has "a lot of haters", probably doubly so after the whole thing with Lancer, and this episode helped alleviate some of the hate. I'm not sure that's really a good reason, though. Like I said, I think I can imagine the kinds of things he saw to become the person he is now. I already thought that Kiritsugu was an interesting character who was amoral, yet somewhat understandable, and I don't really expect seeing his past to change my opinion. But maybe we'll see something more vital in part 2.

As a child, Kiritsugu lived on a tropical island with his father. It seems like it's not part of Japan, because everyone has European names, and Kiritsugu's friend Shirley, an older girl who's sort of like a fun big sister to him, can't pronounce his name (her attempt sounds like "Keritoogoo") and calls him "Kerry". I'm thinking it's one of those small Pacific islands that were colonized by Europeans or became Westernized under the influence of the US military during the war. Kiritsugu's father is doing magical research on freezing time (which, as we saw in his battle with Kayneth, is also Kiritsugu's own magical specialty) and has been experimenting on flowers, making them so they stay in bloom forever. He plans to move up to people at some point. Shirley is working as his assistant and learning some magic herself, even though Father Simon, the local priest, is against it.

Shirley tells Kiritsugu at an improbably romantic cove that his father's research will change the world. She later says Kiritsugu is going to be the one to inherit his father's magic, and we see that the flower she enchanted has died. Kiritsugu's father also gave Shirley a dagger to protect herself with, which she carries around everywhere. 

One day, Kiritsugu's father tells him not to go into the village. Kiritsugu later finds Shirley in the back, by the chicken coop, going crazy and biting the chickens' heads off. She tells him to stay away from her and throws him the dagger, asking him to kill her. Kiritsugu runs off and gets Father Simon, who comes with him, but is attacked by another crazed maniac with red eyes and overcome. Kiritsugu hides from the zombies in his house. The zombies are going to get him anyway, but he's rescued by a squad of church members, one of whom has big, long knives like Kirei. (But I don't see how it could be Kirei; Kiritsugu looks like he's in his late thirties, and Kirei looks, if anything, younger, though he could be a bit older. Also, it's definitely the same church from Tsukihime, and Ciel's chosen weapon was also a set of long knives, so that's probably all it is.) 

The Mage's Association is also there, and sets the village on fire, trying to destroy all the evidence. One of the mages, a tough, butch female mercenary with blue hair, rescues Kiritsugu from zombies and questions him about the mage who created all these zombies (they're actually Dead Apostles, the vampires from Tsukihime, and specifically they're ghouls, the lowest level. Kiritsugu's father apparently was experimenting with the vampires' ability to be unaffected by the passage of time). Kiritsugu says the mage has a barrier in the woods and only he can penetrate it quickly. 

Kiritsugu confronts his father and asks what happened. Kiritsugu's father says the experiment was unfortunately a failure, but they'll continue somewhere else. He has a boat prepared to escape. Kiritsugu stabs his father with Shirley's dagger, thinking of Shirley, and then takes a gun from his father's drawer and shoots him several times. The female magus 
says Kiritsugu got through the barrier pretty easily and comments on what he's done. Kiritsugu says he had to do it, otherwise the research would have continued elsewhere, and the female magus says that's a pretty bad reason to kill your own father. (She earlier said that she didn't expect Kiritsugu to know anything about magic; the fact that he immediately knew what she was talking about, plus his quick entry to the barrier, plus his resemblance to the dead man, probably tipped her off.) 

The episode ends with Kiritsugu sitting on a plane next to the female mage (whose name I think turns out to be Natalia). In the preview, adult Kiritsugu tells us in voiceover that he spent the next several years with her.

A lot of the commenters seemed to be going "Wow, he killed his own father. That explains everything!", but I don't buy it. Maybe that explains how he became an assassin of mages, but at the beginning, when Kirei researched Kiritsugu, he found that he'd been in war zones all across the world. There's more than enough cruelty, betrayal, and pointless death in global war zones (look at Somalia, Iraq, and Syria for a few current examples) to explain why Kiritsugu became such a ruthless, brutal bastard; it's the only way to get by if you're a special operative in a place like that. He then (or maybe concurrently) decided that war needed to end, and he became a ruthless, brutal bastard with a purpose, making him probably able to justify any brutality. His decision to kill off Kayneth and Sola-Ui certainly seems like the decision of a special operative; they weren't much of a threat, given that Kayneth was in a wheelchair and Sola-Ui was so besotted with the unceasingly honorable Lancer that she would probably have ended up being as honorable as Lancer himself. Sola-Ui was magus enough to supply Lancer with mana, but we don't really know how powerful she was, and Lancer himself was considerably weakened by having to break his yellow spear so Saber could defeat Caster. If Kiritsugu had left them alone, they probably would have been finished off by Tokiomi or Kariya (or Kirei, assuming things between him and Tokiomi had gone down the same way). But Kiritsugu doesn't believe in leaving your enemies alive; he believes in utterly destroying them, because that's the only way to guarantee they never come back for revenge, no matter how remote the possibility of that might be. After all, Kayneth would present a pretty unimposing figure wheeling himself onto the battlefield with no magic, his wife cooing over his Servant like Sola-Ui was doing when Maiya captured her, his Servant down one Noble Phantasm. But Kiritsugu doesn't like loose ends. Just knowing that he was a special operative in war zones is enough to understand that, without seeing that he killed his own father.

Still, it wasn't that bad of an episode. (Actually, it was among the worst of Fate/Zero so far, but Fate/Zero is such a good show that it's still pretty good.) And since I have faith in the Fate/Zero team, I still think the next one could justify this one.
** Episodes 19, 20, 21 <2014-10-18 Sat>
Episode 19 is part 2 of Kiritsugu's past. It's not very notable; it just shows how he became an assassin alongside Natalia Kaminski, the woman who rescued him from the wreck of his village after he killed his father. Kiritsugu ends up being forced to kill her, in order to stop a plague of evil magic bees that turn people into ghouls from escaping a plane. 

The whole sidetrip into Kiritsugu's past is probably the worst part so far of Fate/Zero. It almost seems like it was just to explain where his Origin Bullets came from. Granted, they're pretty important to the plot, but not enough to justify two whole episodes just to describe how he got them. 

But Episodes 20 and 21 get back on track. In Episode 20, Kiritsugu comes to visit Iri as she lays dying in her magic circle. Iri returns Avalon to Kiritsugu and says he'll need it for the upcoming battles. Saber has gone out to track down Rider, and Kiritsugu goes out to kill Tokiomi, leaving Maiya to guard Iri. Meanwhile, Waver and Rider are in the forest where Waver first summoned Rider. Waver is planning to sleep all day so Rider can replenish his mana and tells Rider that he knows Rider has been holding back and using his own mana instead of drawing on Waver's. He asks how bad things are, and Rider says he can probably only use Ionioi Hetairoi one more time and he plans to save it for Archer. However, his first order of business is to defeat Saber; he tells Waver he has to beat her to get her back on track, otherwise she'll spend eternity going down the wrong path, which would be sad. 

Waver says he wanted to show everyone that even someone like him could accomplish something as grand as winning the Holy Grail, but Rider says he would admire that goal if the Holy Grail existed, but he doesn't believe it does, just as Okeanos never existed, as he found out after he came to modern day and looked at the atlas. He expresses regret at how many people died following him, dreaming of something that doesn't exist.

Kariya is chained up in the basement and has worms eating at him to heal him. Zouken comes down and says he has a secret weapon for Kariya: the first worm to taste Sakura's chastity, which contains a year's worth of her life force. The worm jumps in Kariya's mouth before he hears that, and Zouken says in a pervy way to live off the life force of a young girl's virginity (or something, he's a damn creepy old bastard). 

Iri and Maiya talk, and when Maiya points out the paradox that Iri knows little of the world, and yet desires to change it, Iri admits that she doesn't really share Kiritsugu's ideals, since she doesn't know enough of the world to know why she should, but she follows them because she believes in Kiritsugu. She says her wish is for Kiritsugu and Saber to win the Grail, because if Kiritsugu wishes for an end to war, that includes the Holy Grail War, and if the Fourth War isn't the last, her daughter Illya will be next.  She asks Maiya what she'll do when Kiritsugu gets his wish and there is no more war in the world. Maiya tells Iri that she's from a small, war-torn country and was a child soldier, and that she doesn't even know her real name; Maiya Hisau is just the name on the first forged passport that Kiritsugu ever gave her. She says she has no idea what she'll do in a world without war, and Iri tells her she has to find her family and her real name. At that moment, someone busts down the door, attacks Maiya, and grabs Iri. Maiya manages to call Kiritsugu before she's overcome.

Kiritsugu uses a Command Spell to get Saber back to the house and get her on the tail of Rider, who kidnapped Iri (apparently; I knew it wasn't him. I had faith in Rider. This totally isn't his style. Plus, as Kiritsugu later mentions, Rider's Master doesn't have the intelligence-gathering capabilities to find the house). Kiritsugu, having discovered that Tokiomi is dead, hurries back to the house and arrives in time to be by Maiya's side as she dies. 

Episode 21 starts with Saber chasing the fake Rider. At some point, the fake Rider disappears and the real Rider appears (you can tell because the real Rider has his chariot). Saber chases him down on her motorcycle and is shocked to see that Iri isn't on the chariot. They fight, and Saber destroys Rider's Gordius Wheel with her Excalibur, but Rider manages to get himself and Waver out of the way, and admits that he made a mistake. Meanwhile, Kiritsugu has captured a stooge of the Matou family and is squeezing him for info. He asks where Kariya is, and the stooge tells him Kariya went to meet some kind of priest who said he was the observer. 

It turns out Berserker has a special ability that allowed him to disguise himself as Rider. He did so, kidnapped Iri, and brought her to Kariya, who is now in league with Kirei. Kirei gives Kariya two Command Spells to replace the two he used to bring this plan about, and tells Kariya if he comes to the church at midnight, he can fight Tokiomi.  Kariya seems to be a little crazy after eating that worm with Sakura's virginity in it. He leaves, and Zouken appears, telling Kirei he actually doesn't know which he would like more: to win, or to see Kariya die a pathetic death. He says he senses that Kirei is the same as him, someone attracted to the smell of rotting flesh, a maggotâ€”and Kirei throws a knife through his head. He doesn't die, of course.

Kariya goes to the church and sees Tokiomi sitting on a pew towards the front. He approaches and realizes that Kariya is already dead. At that moment, Aoi comes in and thinks that Kariya killed Tokiomi. Kariya at first tries to deny it, but he loses track of his argument and instead tries to justify that it was all Tokiomi's fault that Aoi and Sakura couldn't be happy. Aoi screams that Kariya knows nothing about that because he's never loved anyone, but Kariya thinks that he does have someone he loves and he does understand. He grabs Aoi by the neck and strangles her, leaving her dead on the church floor. 

Kariya has basically spent the entire war being a toy of Zouken and Kirei, and now they've decided to get more direct with their torment. Essentially, he's just been mocked and jerked around the whole time, failing to defeat Tokiomi, then having his love hate him, then finally killing her because of his deteriorating mental state, both knowing the end of his life is near and knowing that he's going to die an utterly destroyed man. If Kiritsugu ends up shooting him, that will actually be a mercy in a lot of ways. Kariya's failure had a tragic inevitability to it (even if you don't know that Sakura isn't rescued), but his mental decline was somewhat of a surprise. Still, it makes some sense; Kariya was fighting for others, mainly Aoi and Sakura, and for emotional reasons like wanting to save them and see them happy. But he didn't understand that Aoi loved Tokiomi and that even though losing Sakura made her sad, she didn't blame Tokiomi for it. When he finally saw this, it made him crazy. Plus, hearing that the woman he's loved for all these years thinks that he never loved anyone. But in some ways, even though Kariya was nominally fighting for other people, he was really fighting for himself; or perhaps it would be better to say, he was imposing his ideals on others. And maybe, just a little, he wanted to show Aoi that he was the better man than Tokiomi.  But someone like Kiritsugu can't be shaken like this, because his ideals are beyond emotions like love and hate.

Presumably, Kirei got Aoi to come by telling her that Kariya was going to kill Tokiomi in the church at midnight (or maybe at 12:10, to make sure they didn't meet outside; Kirei was very specific that Kariya come exactly at midnight). Kariya must know that he did it, but I guess it doesn't matter, because Kirei now has Iri, the vessel of the Grail.   And Kirei knows (or at least thinks) that Kariya is no threat to him. Unfortunately, he's probably right; Archer has topped Berserker in two battles now, even if they were inconclusive, and Kirei himself can probably beat Kariya himself, given that Kariya was utterly defeated by Tokiomi. Tokiomi was probably a much stronger magus than Kirei, but Kirei has other weapons than magic. 

But I don't think Kirei will be the one to kill Kariya; I think it'll be Kiritsugu. For one thing, Saber and Berserker must meet on the battlefield since Berserker's true identity is Lancelot. I also feel that it's important that Kiritsugu and Kariya meet. And Kirei and Zouken probably won't want to put Kariya out of his misery since they like watching him suffer so much, but Kiritsugu doesn't mind killing, and death might come as a relief to Kariya. I've been wrong about most of my other predictions, so maybe I'm wrong about this too; maybe Kirei will just kill Kariya. 

(I wonder what Lancelot's backstory is in this version where King Arthur is a girl. I feel like I read somewhere that they still married Saber to Guinevere, as a way to build an alliance, since of course they couldn't have children together. Mordred, who is Saber of Red in Apocrypha, was born by Morgan using magic to impregnate herself with her sister Arturia's weird clone child. I guess even if you have a yuri marriage for political purposes, it could still destabilize the kingdom if one of your knights is doing your waifu, though.)

This might be different in the visual novel (I think it is; guess I'll find out), but in the 2006 anime, the Servants didn't really have relationships with each other, other than Gilgamesh being in love with Saber. I like that the Servants in Zero have relationships with each other, like Rider's desire to recruit Saber for his army (he compliments her martial prowess several times during their battle, and says that girl can only attain her true power by joining his army), or Lancer and Saber's friendly rivalry.  By contrast, in the 2006 anime, the Servants never even really spoke to each other. In particular, Archer and Saber never spoke, even though he must have known her (and he didn't go out of his way to hide anything from Illya). 
** Episode 22 <2014-10-20 Mon>
Episode 22 starts with Waver's fake grandfather calling him to the roof to talk. He pretends like he's still hypnotized, but then he tells Waver he knows Waver isn't his real grandson, because he's too good to be one of theirs. He says he knows Waver doesn't mean any harm by living there and his wife hasn't been that happy in a while, and he asks if Waver can stay a while longer. Waver says he doesn't even know if he'll come back alive. The old fellow says he doesn't know what's so precious Waver would risk his life for it, but when you've lived as long as he has, and you look back on it, you see that nothing is as precious as that.

Kiritsugu knows that Kirei will bring Iri to one of four sites to summon the Grail: Ryudou Temple, the city civic center, the Enzoudan, or Tousaka Manor. He's waiting at the Enzoudan, having already checked the manor and Ryoudou Temple, thinking that if Maiya were still alive he would have sent her to the Enzoudan, but he's now alone again. As Saber walks up, he thinks that he never even thought to count her. Saber announces that she's spent all night scouring the town for Irisviel, but with no luck, and tells Kiritsugu to summon her with his Command Spells if he finds anything. Kiritsugu ignores her as always, and she rides off on her motorcycle.

Kirei has brought Iri to Caster's hideout. Iri tells him that he doesn't understand Kiritsugu at all, and when Kirei asks, she tells him that Kiritsugu's wish is for world peace. Kirei seems amused, saying that humankind's nature is conflict and that he's finally found his reason to fight. He strangles Iri.

Kirei goes to the civic center and fires a signal that can be understood by the other Masters, saying victory has been achieved in the Holy Grail War. Rider and Waver see it, and Rider summons his horse to ride off, but Waver stops him and uses his Command Spells to order him three times to win the Holy Grail, giving up his status as a Master, apparently having taken the old man's words into consideration. Rider insists that Waver come see him win anyway, saying that even if they're no longer Master and Servant, Waver is his friend. They fly off on Rider's horse.

We also see Saber approaching the civic center on her motorcycle, and Kiritsugu leaves the Enzoudan, thinking that Kirei purposely chose the worst location so he could control how the battles happen. Overlooking the city, Gilgamesh tells Kirei that it seems like he's finally found his reason to fight, and Kirei tells him he can go out and fight the other Servants at his full power if he likes. Gilgamesh says to have Berserker hold Saber if she arrives before he gets back.

We see Iri in a dream, looking at a warehouse stacked high with duplicate bodies for her (like the Rei Ayanami tank scene in Eva). She recalls talking to Illya and hearing that Illya had a bad dream where she was a cup and seven lumps were inside her. Iri then drowns in black liquid while dozens of gross hands grab at her.

I'm afraid that Waver is going to die. We know Rider doesn't win since the final battle is Archer versus Saber, as we know from Stay Night. Even though he's no longer a Master, I don't think that will matter to people like Gilgamesh and Kirei; they'd kill him just for the fun of it. Even Kariya might; he's pretty much crazy now, and if anything, realizing he killed Aoi would have just made him more crazy. Hell, even Kiritsugu might, although he does know enough about Waver to know that he's just a kid and not someone who needs to die, like Uryuu, or someone likely to be a future threat, like Kayneth and Sola-Ui. 

Speaking of Kayneth, I'm somewhat disappointed that we never had the Waver/Kayneth grudge match where Waver disproves Kayneth's elitism, but there's so much else going on that I can see why there wasn't time for it. Plus, the victory probably would have been mostly Rider's.

Gilgamesh said "have Berserker" like Berserker was somehow under Kirei's control, but I doubt that Kariya is still working with Kirei, so he probably meant something more like "manipulate the situation so that Berserker...", because even if Kariya is crazy, he must recognize how thoroughly he was tricked. In the same way that Kayneth's arc paralleled the story of Fianna, GrÃ¡inne, and Diarmuid, Kariya's parallels Lancelot's story: he started out with the most chivalrous of intentions, rescuing a young girl from an awful situation, but succumbed to temptation (revenge, in Kariya's case; his obsession with revenge on Tokiomi allowed Kirei to manipulate him) and eventually, insanity. If the parallel were to be followed all the way to the end, Kariya and Berserker would have to somehow play a part for good in the final battle, like when Lancelot showed up to fight with Arthur against Mordred's forces, but it doesn't seem like that's going to happen. (The Kayneth/Sola-Ui/Lancer story didn't end like the myth either.) 
** Episodes 23 and 24 <2014-10-22 Wed>
Waver doesn't die, but the reason is something I didn't really notice until this episode, combined with a coincidence. (At least he doesn't die /yet/. He could still die in the giant fire that's coming up, but I'm not sure even this show is willing to kill off one of its principal characters in a totally meaningless way like that. 

Rider and Archer face off on the bridge. They first share a cup of wine, and Rider asks Gilgamesh if he'll join forces, saying that if they armed his Ionioi Hetairoi  with Gilgamesh's Gate of Babylon, they'd be unbeatable. Gilgamesh refuses, but shows his respect for Rider. Rider summons his Ionioi Hetairoi, but Archer uses Ea, and unleashes Enuma Elish, destroying the Reality Marble, and with it, Rider's chance of victory. Rider asks Waver to be his retainer, and Waver agrees; he asks Waver to stay alive, and remember the final charge of Alexander the Great, and continue the legend. Rider charges, pierced by Gilgamesh's swords; at the last second, as he is about to strike Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh summons some chains to bind his hands and stop him. Rider says ruefully that Gilgamesh always has some trick up his sleeve. Gilgamesh says that Rider can keep challenging him, and he'll always be the garden of the world and there to stop him, alluding to the fact that Alexander the Great intended to make Gilgamesh's city of Babylon his capital before his death. Gilgamesh approaches Waver, asking if he's Rider's Master. Waver tearfully says that he's Rider's retainer. Gilgamesh asks if he's going to fight, and Waver says if he fights, he'll die, and he promised Rider he would live. Gilgamesh says to remain loyal, and leaves without killing Waver, after taking note of his lack of Command Spells. 

Saber and Berserker fight in a parking garage. Berserker attacks Saber with a .50 calibur rifle and an MP5 submachine gun, but Saber overcomes both weapons. Berserker manages to block her Invisible Air, and Saber suspects that he's a knight she used to know. 

Meanwhile, Kariya is slumped against the wall, watching their battle. He sees a hallucination of Sakura, who asks why he's fighting. Kariya says Kirei promised him the Holy Grail if he helped him win, and reminds Sakura that he has to win so they can all have fun together again. Sakura asks if that means she can see her mother again, and Kariya sees Aoi, glaring at him balefully as she did just before he killed her.

The darkness around Berserker recedes, and his sword appears, and Saber recognizes it, naming it as Arondight (more commonly Alondite), and his helmet comes off, and Saber recognizes him as Sir Lancelot, the greatest of her knights. She is utterly puzzled, and cannot understand why he hates her so much, as she recalls Rider's words that she saved her people rather than ruling them, and that she was never a king. For a minute, Berserker has the advantage, but Saber overcomes him, saying even if it means killing her greatest knight, she must reach the Grail. At the same moment that Saber's sword pierces Lancelot, Kariya dies. Lancelot regains sanity in his last few minutes and says some cryptic words.

I was dying from curiosity, so I had to look it up; apparently Arturia Pendragon was married to Guinevere to keep up the pretense that she was a man, and Lancelot fell in love with her as in the normal King Arthur myth. Although Arturia wasn't particularly angry about this, something had to be done because of tradition and the destabilization of the kingdom, so everything went down as in the normal Arthurian legends: Lancelot killed Gawain's brothers, setting off a feud and causing a civil war, and at the end he returned and fought alongside Arturia again. Although she forgave him, he actually wanted to be punished for his crimes against her, and went insane with the weight of his guilty conscience. (This is all from the novel, which I still might read; there's quite a bit that wasn't covered in the anime. But I got that from the wiki. Gen Urobuchi cut that scene, which was a flashback during the final battle of Saber and Berserker, in order to help the scene flow better and keep the viewer in the moment. I admire his principles as a writer, but shounen manga do that all the time, so he could have easily gotten away with it.)

Also, Kariya isn't actually dead (we'll see that in the last epiosde). But being Berserker's Master requires a massive amount of mana, and Kariya's mana was totally drained during Berserker's final battle. I'm sure he dies next time, though; his death was pretty much inevitable from the beginning if you know from Stay Night that he doesn't win, given how horribly his body has deteriorated.

Kiritsugu faces off against Kirei in the basement of the parking garage. This was one of the coolest fight scenes so far in Fate/Zero. It reminds me a lot of a Cowboy Bebop fight scene (and of course, Kiritsugu is Spike Spiegel as a wizard to begin with). Kiritsugu's Origin Bullets don't finish Kirei since Kirei is using Command Spells as mana sources rather than his own Magic Circuits, but Kiritsugu does manage to take out Kirei's right arm on his second shot since Kirei is bolstering his hands with magic and using them to block bullets; the Origin Bullets can still penetrate the magic, and the bullet destroy's Kirei's hand. Kiritsugu also manages to put a knife in Kirei.

Above them, Iri's body disappears and the Grail manifests, spilling black liquid down onto them. Kiritsugu sees a vision in which he perceives the Grail's true nature and realizes it cannot grant his wish. The Grail takes Iri's form and questions Kiritsugu's methods, presenting him with a thought experiment in which all that remains of humanity is five hundred people, three hundred on one ship and two hundred on another, and both ships simultaneously spring a leak, with only Kiritsugu able to fix it and him only able to fix one. Kiritsugu says he would save the three hundred people, but the Grail asks what would happen if the two hundred take him hostage and ask him to fix their ship, and we see the answer: all two hundred people killed. The Grail then says that the three hundred saved split into two groups, a group of one hundred and another of two hundred, and the same thing happens again. Kiritsugu sees that this would mean he killed three hundred to save two hundred. The Grail tells Kiritsugu he's always sacrificed the few for the many and says it could only bring about his wish to end war using a method he understands, which will kill a lot of people. 

The Grail then offers to bring back Iri and Illya, showing Kiritsugu a vision of them in a room back at the Einzbern Castle in Germany. Illya jumps up and hugs him (I don't know why she calls him "Kiritsugu" instead of "Father"; he calls himself "Father" when he's with her, and there seems to be no doubt that he's her father). Essentially, it seems to be tempting him to give up on his ideals and save the few instead of the many. Kirtisugu rejects that. Returning from the vision, he finds that Kirei saw all of it; Kirei says that Kiritsugu is a fool to reject the Grail and says if he's not going to use it, give it to Kirei; Kiritsugu says disgustedly that he doesn't understand Kirei at all and knocks his head into the ground.

Saber faces off against Archer in the room where the Grail is. Archer demands that Saber marry him or else he'll keep stabbing her with swords from his Gate of Babylon (that Archer is one smooth talker). Kiritsugu enters and uses his Command Spell to order Saber to destroy the Holy Grail. Saber is so resistant to this idea that she needs to be ordered again, using Kiritsugu's other Command Spell. Episode 24 ends here.

I was kind of disappointed with how Rider and Berserker ended. I wanted to at least see Rider's armies get shot up by Gilgamesh's Gate of Babylon for a while before Gilgamesh used Ea (which I knew he was going to). But I thought it was interesting that Gilgamesh respects Rider like that. Gilgamesh never seemed to respect anyone; he doesn't respect Kirei, just finds him amusing, and his weird obsession with Saber is more like his obsession with treasure than respect. Rider is, I suppose, the only other Servant in the war who was a king on Gilgamesh's level during life (even though I think the number of people that would have been in Babylon during Gilgamesh's time is closer to Arturia's Britain, so Alexander totally outclasses him in number of subjects). Rider, Saber, and Archer are the three strongest Servants in this war (though Lancelot may well have been a match for them if circumstances had gone differently; he was stated in Arthurian legend and apparently in the novels to be stronger than Arthur). Rider was steadily weakened by circumstances, though; first he was summoned by the rather unimpressive Waver, and then had to use Ionioi Hetairoi twice (against the Assassin squad and against Caster), and then lost his Gordius Wheel to Saber (who, by the way, is able to just throw around Excaliburs like it's nothing in Fate/Zeroâ€”I guess because Kiritsugu has a good supply of mana for her?). But it seemed like Ea would have been able to break Ionioi Hetairoi no matter how strong Rider was at the time. All of this just makes it highly confusing that even Saber could defeat Gilgamesh in the Stay Night anime, since his Enuma Elish is so powerful that it can crack apart the entire world. I guess it was a sign of Gilgamesh's respect for Rider that he pulled out Ea right away, though; he refused to use it at all against Caster, and he engages Saber with Gate of Babylon (though he wants to avoid killing her so he can marry her). 

Berserker's final scene was probably a lot cooler in the novels. I understand Urobuchi's reason for not adapting it that way, though. I'm glad that Kariya isn't quite dead yet, because his story really never had an emotional conclusion. I expected Kiritsugu killing him to be the emotional conclusion, but it seems he makes it back to the Matou house and has a final talk with Sakura.

Apparently, in the novels, it was stated that Zouken set Kariya up with Aoi when they were kids because he knew she would be able to breed magic back into the Matou line. Kariya left his training as a magus because he disapproved of Zouken's ruthless and creepy methods, and left Aoi to marry Tokiomi, hoping she would be happy with him. He was something of a family friend before the Holy Grail War, and it seems he even approved of Tokiomi, since Tokiomi provided for Aoi and her children well and was non-creepy and apparently not as ruthless. (Hm...Which would I rather have, magic based on pretty shiny jewels that sparkle, or magic based on creepy gross worms that burrow into your flesh?) He scratched out a living as a freelance reporter before the war, so he was kind of like Spiderman.

The wiki page also explains that some of Kariya's apparently awful decisions (like trusting Kirei even after Kirei obviously betrayed him by sending Aoi to find him with the dead Tokiomi) and his decreasing sanity come from the fact that not only is he in constant pain from the worms in his body, the worms are also eating his brain and driving him insane, kind of like syphilis. (There's some kind of rap here...he's in constant pain, the worms are in his brain, eating the grey matter and driving him insane...) The wiki also points out that since he was able to sustain Berserker's massive mana requirements even though he was never trained as a magus, he was well-suited to be a Master and could have made a good go with the very powerful Lancelot as some other, non-Berserker class. (Berserker might have suited Kaynethâ€”he had pretty high mana, and he just wanted mindless obedience, which the Berserker class will give as long as the Master has the mana to keep the Servant under control. The worms suck Kariya dry and make it harder for him to sustain the mana output whenever Berserker uses too much power, and this allows Berserker to leave Kariya's control and go after Saber instead of going after Archer like Kariya usually wants. Of course, this was never a problem for Illya, whose mana is essentially infinite.) 

In the novel, Kiritsugu apparently ranked the Masters according to how dangerous they were; Kirei was number one, Kayneth was number two, and Tokiomi was number three. I guess that makes Uryuu dead-last, huh? (The articles I read didn't include the whole list, but I'm guessing after that, there was an exponential dropoff in danger, with Kariya next, but still exponentially less dangerous than Tokiomi, then Waver, and finally Uryuu in dead last, since he's just a creepy insane serial killer with no real magic abilities who can just be shot by Kiritsugu or Maiya.) Presumably this didn't include the Servants, since Gilgamesh is the most dangerous Servant, and Rider is much more dangerous than Lancer or Assassin.
