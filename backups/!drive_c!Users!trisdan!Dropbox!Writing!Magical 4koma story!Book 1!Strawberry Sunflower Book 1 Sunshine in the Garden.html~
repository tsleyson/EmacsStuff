        <p class="standard"><b></b>How
are you? I'm Nora. </p><p class="standard">This
is a story about how I made my first friend at my new school. By the
time I met her, it wasn't really my new school anymore because I had
already been there for two months. But until I finally made a friend,
it didn't feel like my school at all.</p><p class="standard">My
school is called St. Galgani's Academy for the Gifted. It's a
boarding school. That means you don't go home after school; I have my
own room in the girl's dormitory where I go sleep every night. I eat
breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the dining hall with the other
elementary school kids.</p><p class="standard">St.
Galgani's is a school for kids with special talents, so there are a
lot of amazing people here. Oh, I'm not one of them. Some people from
the academy came to my old school one day and tested everyone to see
if any of us had special gifts. They told me I didn't have any gift,
but I would someday, and asked me to come to the academy. I was
scared when I thought about going away to live by myself at school
without my parents, but my big sister told me to think of it like an
adventure and just throw myself in. My big sister tells me to do lots
of things that aren't good ideas, but she was right for once, so I
came to this academy.</p><p class="standard">Everything
was scary at first like I thought. The academy was almost as big as
the neighborhood I used to live in with my parents. It had its own
swimming pool, a big garden, a forest, and a horse corral. My old
school would have fit in just the building where my bedroom was. I
was nervous, but also excited to make friends and do lots of
interesting things that I could tell my big sister and the other kids
back home about.</p><p class="standard">On
the first day of school my teacher, Miss Hanover, had me come up to
the front and introduce myself to the class. The night before I had
come up with a speech I wanted to say, about making friends and
having fun together for the next year, but when I looked at all those
people sitting in front of me, it all left me. </p><p class="standard">"Go
on, introduce yourself," said Miss Hanover.</p><p class="standard">"I,
I don't know what...to say," I whispered.</p><p class="standard">Miss
Hanover's tail flicked. Oh, I forgot to mention that Miss Hanover is
a fox lady. She has a fox's ears and tail. Lots of people at my
school are part animal. There are cat people and dog people too, and
probably other kinds of animal that I haven't met yet. </p><p class="standard">At
the time I thought she was mad at me, but I later found out that her
tail flicks when she's feeling sorry for someone. Even though she has
the Gift of Trickery, she can't ever play tricks that are too cruel
because her tail will flick and give her away. </p><p class="standard">"Why
don't you tell them your name?" Miss Hanover suggested.</p><p class="standard">"Um,
hi, my name is Nora," I said, looking over the rows and rows of
desks. I counted them later; there were only twenty of them, four
columns and five rows to a column, but on that day it seemed like
they reached all the way up to the moon. </p><p class="standard">One
of the girls in front looked at me, and I looked back, and then
suddenly got nervous and looked down, letting my bangs fall down over
my face to hide it.</p><p class="standard">"Um,
uh, I like reading, and, um...my name is Nora, and..." I tried
to remember my speech. I had written it all down and recited it in my
head three times, but it was all gone now.</p><p class="standard">"What's
your favorite book?" asked a boy in the second row.</p><p class="standard">"Um...I
like ham...ham and..."</p><p class="standard">I
was trying to say "Hamlet", but I started stuttering and
couldn't get out the last part, and everyone thought I was saying I
liked ham and laughed. That made me even more nervous, and I could
feel my face getting hot. Besides, <i>Hamlet
</i>wasn't
my favorite book to begin with.</p><p class="standard">"I
mean, my favorite book is <i>Lyrical
Ballads </i>by
William Wordsworth!" I corrected, but no one heard because they
were all laughing.</p><p class="standard">I wanted to run away,
but Miss Hanover put her hand on my shoulder and whispered, "It's
okay, just wait a minute and tell them again." So I did. When
everyone had stopped laughing, I said it again.</p><p class="standard">"Myfavoritebookis<i>LyricalBallads</i>byWilliamWordsworth."</p><p class="standard">"I don't
understand. Talk slower,"  said the boy who had asked the
question.</p><p class="standard">"My
favorite book is <i>Lyrical
Ballads </i>by
William Wordsworth," I said, more slowly.</p><p class="standard">"What, I've never
heard of that." </p><p class="standard">"Well, I have,"
said Miss Hanover. "It's a very beautiful book, and Nora is a
very good reader to be able to understand it. Why don't you ask her
about it later? For now, though, let's start class. Nora, you can sit
in that desk there, okay?"</p><p class="standard">"Okay," I
said, my face still burning. I was glad to be done, and I went to my
desk towards the back of the classroom and sat down and buried my
face in my arms so I wouldn't have to look at anyone.</p><p class="standard"><br /></p><p class="standard">I didn't make things
any better during our first group assignment. It was a week after
class began, and when everyone paired up, I was the only one left
without a partner, so Miss Hanover assigned me to work with Greta and
Sweta to answer some questions about a book we had read. </p><p class="standard">Greta and Sweta
started talking about a show they had watched on TV last night and
ignoring the assignment and me as soon as we all moved our chairs
into a circle and sat down. I looked over the questions, waiting for
them to be done so we could start answering.</p><p class="standard">After five minutes
they still weren't done, so I said, "Um...uh...".</p><p class="standard">They ignored me.</p><p class="standard">"Ex, ex, excuse
me...Um, about the assignment..."</p><p class="standard">Finally they looked
up, glaring at me like they were annoyed. "What was your name
again? I forget," said Greta.</p><p class="standard">"N-Nora," I
said.</p><p class="standard">"I'm talking to
Sweta, so we'll do the assignment later. What are you, some kind of
teacher's pet?"</p><p class="standard">I looked down and hid
behind my bangs, and Greta and Sweta kept talking and went back to
ignoring me. I did the assignment on my own, handed it in to Miss
Hanover, and got to go to lunch early; when I got back everyone was
calling me a teacher's pet.</p><p class="standard"><br /></p><p class="standard">I
had never been a star at sports, but I wasn't that bad. I used to
have fun swimming and playing softball and soccer with my friends at
my old school. So when we had soccer for PE, I thought maybe I could
do something good for my team and show everyone that I wasn't just
a teacher's pet weirdo who stutters.</p><p class="standard">We were playing out on
the third field, a smaller field where the elementary schoolers
usually ended up for PE. St. Galgani's also has a middle school and a
high school, and the high schoolers usually get the bigger first and
second fields. Our teams had been picked by Ms. Rutherford, the
girls' PE teacher. I was on Cora's team, and we were playing against
Leah's team.</p><p class="standard">Things weren't too bad
at first. I stayed near the back, closer to my team's goal, and
helped move the ball away from our goal and get it back to my
teammates a few times. We were ahead by one goal. Leah's team had the
ball and was moving it back towards our goal, but they were still at
center field. Most of our team was clustered around Leah and Gracie,
who were passing the ball back and forth and moving it down towards
us.</p><p class="standard">Then I saw that
Mikaela, the strongest player on Leah's team, wasn't standing by the
cluster where the rest of the team was; she was off to the side by
herself. I realized what was going on: Leah was planning to pass the
ball to Mikaela, who was too far away for any of my team to reach in
time. Mikaela would have a clear shot at the goal.</p><p class="standard">I was the only one who
had noticed. It seemed like my chance had come.</p><p class="standard">I ran towards Mikaela,
who was still watching the main action and hadn't seen me. I saw Leah
receive the ball from Gracie and then pass it towards us.</p><p class="standard">I was on Mikaela just
as she received the ball. I went to kick it away from her. </p><p class="standard">Suddenly, my feet slid
out from under me, and I flailed my legs around, trying to keep my
balance. It didn't work, but my foot did hit the ball as I fell
backwards.</p><p class="standard">The ball bounced off
my foot and flew up into the air, slamming straight into Mikaela's
nose. Mikaela reacted too late and was hit. I saw her grab onto her
nose.</p><p class="standard">I found out later that
someone had left a kiwi skin on the field. It was brown and green, so
it blended in with the grass and I couldn't see it. If you've never
eaten one, they're delicious, but at that time I wished there was no
such thing as a kiwi.</p><p class="standard">Ms. Rutherford stopped
the game and everyone came over to see what was going on. My own
teammates almost stepped on me as they ran over to find out what was
going on.</p><p class="standard">"Are you all
right, Mikaela?" asked Ms. Rutherford.</p><p class="standard">"I think my nose
is bleeding," Mikaela said.</p><p class="standard">"I'll take her to
the infirmary, Ms. Rutherford," said Gracie, and the two of them
left the field.</p><p class="standard">Gracie came back a few
minutes later and we kept playing, but everyone on Leah's team was
mad at me because I took out their best player. As for my own team,
they were mad at me because when we started playing again, Ms.
Rutherford gave Leah's team a penalty kick against us since I had
broken the rules and hit Mikaela with the ball.</p><p class="standard"><br /></p><p class="standard">When I wrote my sister
a letter asking how to make friends, she wrote back and said
"Everyone loves cookies. Try giving cookies to people, and
they'll want to be your friends."</p><p class="standard">I
woke up before class one day and took my allowance over to the
shopping center at the high school, where there were lots of
restaurants and bakeries, and bought a bag of little shortbread
cookies in the shape of hearts and stars and crosses. They were warm,
crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, one of the best things
I had ever tasted.</p><p class="standard">I put the cookies in a
basket and came into the classroom before anyone else got there. I
pinned a card to the basket that said "Please take one and
enjoy". Then I waited for everyone else to come.</p><p class="standard">Miss Hanover was the
first to arrive. "Nora, did you bring these?" she asked.</p><p class="standard">"Yes, I wanted to
do something nice for everyone."</p><p class="standard">"How sweet.
You're a nice girl, Nora."</p><p class="standard">Miss Hanover was
always nice to me, even though I had almost screamed the first time I
saw her fox ears and had asked all sorts of questions about them. It
made me feel good to be complimented by her, but that was the sort of
thing that made everyone call me a teacher's pet, so I tried not to
feel too good about it.</p><p class="standard">Before very long,
other people started to come in. Some of them ignored the cookies,
but two boys&mdash;I thought their names were Robert and Philip&mdash;stopped
and asked Miss Hanover if they could really have some.</p><p class="standard">"Yes, go ahead.
They're for everyone," said Miss Hanover.</p><p class="standard">"Did you bring
them, Miss Hanover?" Philip asked.</p><p class="standard">"No, I'm not the
one who brought them," said Miss Hanover, and she caught my eye
and smiled. I knew she was telling me I should come forward as the
bringer of cookies, but suddenly I felt so embarrassed that I
couldn't even speak.</p><p class="standard">"I wonder who
brought them?" said Robert.</p><p class="standard">"Uh, I-I-I-I..."
I managed to say, my voice barely higher than a whisper. The girl
sitting in front of me looked back, and I looked down and hid behind
my bangs.</p><p class="standard">"Maybe they're
poisoned!" Philip suggested. "Maybe some crazy guy is
trying to kill us like rats, by leaving poisoned cookies around."</p><p class="standard">I buried my burning
red face in my arms. I definitely couldn't come forward after that.
With the way things usually went, if I came forward, everyone would
say I had tried to poison them as revenge for being called a
teacher's pet.</p><p class="standard"></p><p class="standard">After the cookie
incident, I gave up for a while on trying to make friends and tried
to keep my head down. I started to think that I was trying too hard
to stand out. It was okay if the rest of the class thought I was
weird, as long as I had one friend to talk to. And maybe if I had one
friend, other people would also become my friends.</p><p class="standard">I decided to be
scientific about searching for a friend. I wanted someone nice and
smart, who had something in common with me. An animal person might be
good too; Miss Hanover was a fox lady, and she was the only person
who'd been nice to me since I came here. </p><p class="standard">I
decided on Cora. She wore glasses, so she was probably smart, and our
names rhymed, so that gave us something in common. And she was a cat
girl, and I liked cats; we had one at home named Pudding. Her hair,
which she usually wore in pigtails, was orange and white, just like
her ears and tail, and she seemed really nice when she was with other
people;
she was always laughing and having fun.</p><p class="standard">I never actually
thought about it scientifically. If I had ever written down my
reasons for choosing Cora and read them, I might have been able to
see how silly they were. </p><p class="standard">One day, after class,
I summoned up all my courage and went up to Cora to ask her to be my
friend.</p><p class="standard">When she saw me
approaching, she ignored me.</p><p class="standard">I almost left right
there, but all my courage was still with me, so I said "H-hello...".</p><p class="standard">"What?" Cora
asked. "Do you need something?"</p><p class="standard">"Um, I-I-I wanted
to ask you to be my f-f-f-friend..."</p><p class="standard">For a second I thought
Cora was going to say yes. She looked at me thoughtfully, took off
her glasses, breathed on them, wiped them on her shirt, put them back
on, and looked at me squarely.</p><p class="standard">"No," she
said. "You're a teacher's pet and you read too much. I hate
reading. It makes my head hurt."</p><p class="standard">"B-but&mdash;"</p><p class="standard">"You probably
thought I liked reading because I wear glasses, right? Don't be
stupid. Wearing glasses has nothing to do with reading. I'm just
blind." Cora hitched up her backpack across one shoulder and
smoothed down her skirt. "See you."</p><p class="standard">Even though no one was
there after she left, I still sat down at my desk and buried my head
in my arms.</p><p class="standard"><br /></p><p class="standard">I tried to stay home
from school the day after that, but it's hard to have your mother
call in sick for you when you live at the school and your mother
doesn't. Miss Hanover came to my room to get me when I didn't come to
breakfast.</p><p class="standard">"Nora, are you in
here?" she asked as she knocked at my door. </p><p class="standard">I didn't really want
to see anyone, but I was afraid to make Miss Hanover mad since she
was the only person who talked to me, so I got out of my top bunk,
climbed down the ladder, and answered the door.</p><p class="standard">"I was a little
bit worried since you weren't at breakfast," said Miss Hanover,
her fox ears pointed straight up at the sky and her tail swirling as
she smiled down at me. She was holding a white porcelain vase for
some reason. "Are you sick?"</p><p class="standard">"Yes." I hid
behind my bangs, waiting for her to say something else.</p><p class="standard">"Nora, could you
possibly do me a favor?" she said at last. "If you'll do
this for me, you can stay in bed the rest of the day."</p><p class="standard">Miss Hanover was too
nice to ask a sick person to do a favor for her in return for being
allowed to stay in bed, so she must know I wasn't really sick. Still,
I kept looking down and waiting for her to leave.</p><p class="standard">"The classroom is
just so gloomy. I think some flowers would look nice in it. Don't you
think so?"</p><p class="standard">"Yes."</p><p class="standard">"Do you know
where the garden is? Have you ever been there?"</p><p class="standard">I nodded, still
looking down. I had seen it on the tour and I walked by it sometimes,
but I had never gone inside. </p><p class="standard">"If you can
choose some nice flowers for me, and put them in this vase and bring
them to the classroom, then I'll let you have today off. What do you
say?"</p><p class="standard">"Yes, Miss
Hanover," I agreed. Since she was nice enough to offer me a deal
like that even when she knew I wasn't sick, I might as well take it.
Plus, a walk in the garden might make me feel better. </p><p class="standard">I went back into my
room and got dressed in some old jeans and a T-shirt so I wouldn't
get any of my nice clothes dirty in the garden, then took the vase
and left the dormitory headed for the garden.</p><p class="standard">The weather outside
was beautiful, and the warm sun felt nice. The garden was pretty far
from the dormitory, on the edge of the forest, and I walked
extra-slow to enjoy the sunshine, so it took me a while to get there.
It was surrounded by a high white fence, one of those ornate wrought
iron fences that are as much art as fence, with the metal twisted
into leaves and vines and flowers. It was fenced in to keep the deer
and rabbits out, not the people; the gate was usually unlocked and
anyone who wanted to could go inside. </p><p class="standard">I opened the gate and
went in, closing it behind me, and right away I was face-to-face with
a sea of purple, red, yellow, and green. Flowers and plants of all
kinds were in front of me: tulips and daisies and begonias and
orchids. I walked along the winding stone path underneath a lime
tree, and saw a white marble statue of a young boy enclosed in twigs
and bramble, and thought of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem "This
Lime Tree Bower My Prison". </p><p class="standard">Now that I was here, I
had no intention of quickly choosing some flowers and trotting back
to the classroom with them. I had to explore this place, at least a
little. As pretty as the flowers here were, I felt as if there must
be much prettier flowers somewhere further inside, and I wanted to
find them. </p><p class="standard">I'm not sure how much
time I spent wandering the stone paths of that huge, dreamlike
garden, looking at flowers, eating the fruit that grew on the trees,
admiring the creeping vines and ivy and climbing roses that grew up
the trellises, and resting inside the gazebos, staring through their
latticework walls, the light coming down on me in criss-cross
patterns. I spent at least an hour, though it felt much longer.</p><p class="standard">I came into a clear
and more orderly area where someone had set up raised planter boxes
and was growing potatoes and rutabagas. It seemed to be a dead end;
at the other end was a high hedge that ran all the way down to a
stone wall on both sides. But from the way the garden fence had
looked from the outside, it seemed there should be more to it. It
seemed there should be something past that hedge.</p><p class="standard">I came up to the hedge
and tried to look through to the other side, but it was so thick that
I couldn't see anything at all. I walked along the hedge from stone
wall to stone wall, trying to find some spot where I could see
through, but there wasn't one.</p><p class="standard">As I was making a
second pass along the hedge, I noticed a squirrel creeping along the
bushes ahead of me. The squirrel brushed up against a misplaced clump
of light purple martagon lilies growing in the shade of the hedge.</p><p class="standard">Suddenly the hedge
parted.</p><p class="standard">I dashed to where the
squirrel was, but the hole in the hedge had disappeared by the time I
got there, making me wonder if it was just a mirage, some trick of
the light. I watched the squirrel go off on its business. The hole
had appeared exactly when the squirrel had touched those lilies.</p><p class="standard">I touched the lilies. </p><p class="standard">The hedge parted
again.</p><p class="standard">It was a small hole,
just large enough for me to go through crawling on my hands and
knees. It was a good thing I'd changed into my jeans. I got down and
pulled myself into the tunnel.</p><p class="standard">For a brief moment I
was in the dark, surrounded by hedge on all sides. I pulled myself
through, and emerged back into the sunlight on the other side.</p><p class="standard">I stood up and looked
around. This area of the garden didn't look so different from the
other side, so I wasn't sure why they'd gone to all the trouble of
hiding it, except...</p><p class="standard">Nearby was a plant
that looked like a sunflower. Except there was something weird about
it, something that made me look twice. I went up to the sunflower to
get a better look. It truly was a beautiful sunflower, tall and
bright yellow with a crisp green stalk. Except that it didn't have
seeds in the middle like a normal sunflower. It had some kind of huge
red fruit in the middle, something that looked a lot like a
strawberry.	</p><p class="standard">I picked one,
wondering if I should eat it. I'd never seen a plant like this
before. I sniffed the fruit. It smelled like a strawberry. I tasted
it. It was a strawberry.</p><p class="standard">A sunflower with
strawberries growing in the middle. </p><p class="standard">I knew then that I had
to find the prettiest flowers from this corner of the garden. This
was definitely where the prettiest flowers would be. Why else would
they hide it behind that hedge?</p><p class="standard">There were no paths
back here except what had been worn in the grass by people walking
through. I followed those worn trails around looking for signs of
flowers. Now that I thought of it, those martagon lilies outside had
been pretty. Maybe there were more of them in here somewhere. </p><p class="standard">I made my way towards
a patch of tomatoes, their vines wound around wooden stakes in the
ground. Next to them was a small grove of trees with wooden tubes,
pointed down at the tomato patch like the cannons of a pirate ship,
growing from the branches. Martagon lilies like the shade, so there
might be some in the shadow of those trees.</p><p class="standard">As I was approaching
the tomato patch, something hard hit me in the chest, bouncing off
and leaving behind a stinging pain. I knelt to see what it was. It
was a walnut.</p><p class="standard">WHOOSH!</p><p class="standard">Several more walnuts
flew past my head, barely missing my face.</p><p class="standard">I looked up, and saw
that the trees were shooting walnuts out of those tubes; nuts encased
in a hard brown shell about the size of a golf ball were being
showered on me from above.</p><p class="standard">POP!</p><p class="standard">The tomatoes
suddenly began to burst, spraying red juice and flesh and seeds all
over me. The explosion of the tomatoes on the first plant seemed to
set off a chain reaction; the explosions rippled through the patch,
moving outward from me. The next instant I was completely soaked with
tomato juice from head to toe, and walnuts were still raining down on
my head.</p><p class="standard">I turned around and
ran away from that tomato patch as fast as I could, walnuts flying
after me like bullets as I went. I didn't stop running until I was
well out of range of all those dangerous plants, and then I collapsed
on the grass, out of breath.</p><p class="standard">I hope you won't think
I'm too much of a crybaby if I admit that I cried. After two months
with no friends or family, after what Cora said to me yesterday,
after being attacked by tomato bombs and walnut artillery, I think
you'd cry too, or at least you'd want to.</p><p class="standard">I sat there in the
middle of the rut worn in the grass and cried for a minute, until a
girl I didn't know appeared on the garden path ahead of me. Then I
got embarrassed and stopped. At least, I tried.</p><p class="standard">"My, I'm so
sorry! I grew those plants to protect this place from intruders, but
I didn't think about how how it would feel to be attacked by them!"</p><p class="standard">I stood up and wiped
my eyes, and then thought to check and make sure Miss Hanover's vase
was still okay. It wasn't. The walnuts had hit it and chipped off a
piece of the brim, and I'd dropped it when I collapsed to the ground,
getting dirt and grass all over it.</p><p class="standard">The girl I didn't
know&mdash;she looked older than me, possibly a middle school or high
school student&mdash;tossed her long blonde braid back over her shoulder
and took a handkerchief from the pocket of her overalls. "Here,
use it to wipe off some of the tomato juice," she said, giving
it to me.</p><p class="standard">I took the
handkerchief and wiped my eyes and face with it. I felt bad, because
what was on my face wasn't just tomato juice, but also tears and snot
from crying, so I said, hiding behind my bangs, "I, I, I'll get
it w-washed...for you."</p><p class="standard">"No worries,"
said the girl. She reached into the leather satchel slung over her
shoulder and took out a Thermos. "Here, drink some of this. It's
tea with peppy mint."</p><p class="standard">"Peppermint?"</p><p class="standard">"<i>Peppy</i>mint. I grow it here. It'll fill you with cheer and vigor and give
you enough energy to do anything! Here, try it."</p><p class="standard">I took the tea from
her and sipped. It was good. It tasted just like the mint tea that my
mother used to make back home. Each sip seemed to warm up both my
body and my heart. </p><p class="standard">"Are you better?"
the girl asked. </p><p class="standard">"A little,"
I said.</p><p class="standard">"Good." Her
eyes went to the vase in my hand. "Were you here looking for
some flowers?"</p><p class="standard">"Yes. My teacher
asked me to get some for the classroom."</p><p class="standard">"I know this
whole garden," the girl said. "Maybe I can help you find
some that you like."</p><p class="standard">"Um, that would
be really good. Um, there were some martagon lilies that I touched to
come inside here..."</p><p class="standard">"Oh, those? Yeah,
the hedge can smell lilies on you. It opens if it smells that, but
you have to be pretty close to it, or else it can't smell. There's
another clump of them this way."</p><p class="standard">The strange girl led
me off down another trail, away from the exploding tomato patch. As
we walked I saw other amazing plants that I had never heard of. I
asked the girl about them as we walked by.</p><p class="standard">"Those are
beehive bellflowers," she said as we walked by a planter box
full of huge cup-shaped violet flowers buzzing with bees. "There's
enough space for the bees to build hives inside the flower itself.
Then the flower has a built-in pollinator. The bees make honey inside
the flowers, so it's also possible for a beekeeper to move them to
another flower and then take a whole flower to get the honey from."</p><p class="standard">When I asked her about
some strange climbing vines sprouted along the whole length with pale
pink and purple flowers, she said, "Those are flower crown
vines. Rather than pick a bunch of flowers and chain them together,
you just pick the vine, trim it to size, and tie it on your head."</p><p class="standard">We passed a patch of
gigantic blood red flowers with yellow spots, each the size of one of
my shirts. "Aren't those rafflesia?" I asked. "The
flowers that smell like rotting meat?"</p><p class="standard">"Those ones don't
smell like rotting meat. They're rose rafflesia. They smell like
roses." And they did; the scent was so strong, I could smell it
even from ten feet away. "And you can only see the flowers on
normal rafflesia for about three days in a year, but you can see
these ones year-round," she added.</p><p class="standard">We reached a large
clearing where some less unusual trees and plants had been allowed to
grow. Thriving in the shade of an elm tree were some martagon lilies,
like the ones that had parted the hedge.</p><p class="standard">The girl bent down and
picked some, and stuck them in the vase under my arm with a smile.
"Here you go. Oh, take some of these carnations too. They'll
look beautiful in your classroom."</p><p class="standard">"Thank you,"
I said, accepting the flowers. For a moment we looked at each other,
and then I got embarrassed and hid behind my bangs.</p><p class="standard">"Well, I guess
you'd better get back to your classroom," said the girl. "Your
teacher and all your friends must be waiting for you."</p><p class="standard">"Oh. Um, er,
actually, I...I...I don't have any friends in my class."</p><p class="standard">"Oh. What about
in another class?"</p><p class="standard">I shook my head, too
embarrassed to look at her.</p><p class="standard">"In another
school?"</p><p class="standard">I shook my head again.
"I had some friends at my old school, but none at this academy."</p><p class="standard">"That's not
right. With so many people at this school, none of them should be
left without a single friend." The girl reached into her leather
satchel again and brought out some peaches. "Tell you what. If
you like, I'll be your friend."</p><p class="standard">I looked her straight
in her blue eyes, my mouth open in shock. "R-really? You'd&mdash;you'd
be my friend, just like that?"</p><p class="standard">"Sure. You seem
like a nice person. No one with such good taste in flowers could be
bad." The girl smiled and handed me a peach.</p><p class="standard">I took the peach and
bit into it. It was the sweetest peach I could ever remember eating.</p><p class="standard">And just like that, I
made my first friend at St. Galgani's.</p><p class="standard">"My name is Lily.
I go to the middle school here. What's your name?"</p><p class="standard">"Um, I'm Nora.
I'm from the elementary school. Um, did you grow all the plants on
this side of the big hedge?"</p><p class="standard">"Sure did."
Lily beamed with pride. "I love gardening. Being with plants is
so peaceful, you can forget all your troubles here."</p><p class="standard">I agreed. Up until the
tomatoes and walnut trees had attacked me, I'd been having a great
time in the garden. And after that, I'd had a great time walking
around with Lily in here.</p><p class="standard">"My trouble is
school, so I like to come here to forget about it."</p><p class="standard">Something seemed wrong
with that, but I didn't want to lose my first friend by saying so.</p><p class="standard">By the way, when I
went to apologize to Miss Hanover for breaking her vase, she wasn't
mad at all. "Someone who used to be in my class always said the
garden was a place to forget all your troubles," she said. "So
I sent you there so you'd forget about whatever was bothering you."</p><p class="standard">I told her I had met
Lily and we were friends now. "Is that so? I'm happy for you,
Nora."</p><p class="standard">Miss Hanover probably
sent me there hoping I would meet Lily and the two of us would become
friends. That's the sort of foxy teacher she is.</p>

      <h2 class="heading"><a id="My_friend_Lily">My
friend Lily. By Nora.</a></h2>
      <img src="myfriendlily.jpg" />
      <div class="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard">Even
though I still didn't have any friends in class, everything seemed
better now that I had Lily. When I had to work on a group assignment
and the rest of the group was ignoring me and talking, I would do the
assignment on my own and imagine what Lily would think about it.
Talking to people in class seemed easier, because I wasn't so worried
about saying the wrong thing and ruining my chance to make a friend.</p><p class="standard">After
class, I would go over to the garden and rub the scent of martagon
lilies on my hands and part the hedge, and go through to Lily's
secret corner of the garden, and we would talk while I helped her
take care of the plants. They needed a lot of things, like water,
special soil, and different amounts of sunlight. Some of them also
needed trimming and pruning. Lily took care of all of them, and she
seemed to always know exactly what each plant wanted, as if she could
talk to them.</p><p class="standard">One
day I was watering a patch of roses when I saw a purple flower that I
recognized as a milk thistle growing underneath a rose plant. I was
about to pull it out, but Lily stopped me.</p><p class="standard">"Don't
pull it out," she said.</p><p class="standard">"But
milk thistles are weeds. They overgrow everything else," I said.</p><p class="standard">"They
may be selfish, but as long as we make sure they share, we can still
let them live here," said Lily, taking her garden trowel from
the pocket of her overalls. She slid it down into the soil and pulled
up the milk thistle, leaving all of its roots intact inside a clump
of dirt. "Let's go find somewhere we can let this little one
grow."</p><p class="standard">We
settled on a space near the blackberry bushes with lots of sunlight.
"The blackberries are selfish too," said Lily, "so
they'll help keep him in line. And some day he might thank us for
letting him live here. You know, milk thistle can be used to make
medicine that can help cure liver disease and poison mushroom. So
even though some people call them weeds, they also have a gift that
only they can give us."</p><p class="standard">"You
always seem to know exactly what to do when it comes to plants,"
I said.</p><p class="standard">"It's
my gift. I have the Gift of Gardening." Lily took some
strawberries from her satchel and offered them to me. They were from
the strawberry sunflower, and were some of the ripest and sweetest
I'd ever tasted. "Though it might be better to say I have the
gift of understanding what plants are telling me."</p><p class="standard">"Do
they talk?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"They
don't talk or make any noises, but they do have feelings. They're not
like human feelings or animal feelings, though. Plant feelings are
slow, strong, twisting. A person might be mad for a few minutes, but
a plant builds up its feelings gradually over a long time, and then
keeps feeling that way for a long time."</p><p class="standard">I
didn't totally understand, but I thought it was amazing, and I told
Lily so.</p><p class="standard">"It's
not that amazing." Lily looked embarrassed to be complimented
like that. "I may be able to understand plants, but it means I
have a hard time understanding people."</p><p class="standard">We
finished taking care of the plants, and as we were leaving the
garden, Lily said, "I told you about my gift, but I never asked
what your gift is."</p><p class="standard">"Oh.
Um, my gift, er...I don't know yet."</p><p class="standard">"Oh,
you're a Potential."</p><p class="standard">"Yes.
It's kind of embarrassing..."</p><p class="standard">Lily
shook her head. "There's nothing wrong with being a Potential.
It's kind of fun that way, wondering what gift you'll get, looking
forward to the wonderful things you'll be able to do someday. It's
like waiting for Christmas."</p><p class="standard">Some
of the kids with gifts looked down on Potentials, who didn't have
gifts yet, but what Lily said made me feel good about it. Even though
she had such an amazing gift, she wasn't snobby at all.</p><p class="standard">Lily
was in middle school, so her dormitory and dining hall were in a
different building across the field from the elementary school, but
she seemed to spend a lot of time in the elementary school building,
even though middle schoolers weren't supposed to come over here. It
seemed like Miss Hanover had given her permission to come over
whenever she wanted to. I would often come to breakfast or dinner and
find her in the dining hall, waiting for me. We would go through the
line and get our food, then choose a small table in one of the
corners, away from all the hustle and bustle of the walkway. Once the
head chef himself came out to talk to Lily at our table.</p><p class="standard">"Lily,
thanks for all these beautiful vegetables you grow for us," he
said, as I hid behind my bangs.</p><p class="standard">"Thank
you for making them into such nice food," said Lily. "I'm
sure they're happy to be cooked by someone as skilled as you."</p><p class="standard">"No,
no. Good food comes from the ingredients. Without ingredients, a chef
is nothing." The head chef then turned his gaze on me. "Is
this your friend?"</p><p class="standard">"Yeah,
this is my friend Nora," said Lily. "She's been helping me
out in the garden."</p><p class="standard">"Thanks
for your good work, Nora," said the head chef.</p><p class="standard">"Um,
y-you're welcome..." I stammered.</p><p class="standard">"I'd
better get back to the kitchen. Thanks again," said the head
chef.</p><p class="standard">When
Lily and I had finished eating, Lily said, "I guess I should go
check my mail."</p><p class="standard">"The
mail doesn't come to your room?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"No,
my club mailbox. I've been neglecting the club for a while now."</p><p class="standard">"Oh you're in a club? And they make you check the mail?"</p><p class="standard">Lily
smiled. "Well, I am the club president&mdash;and only member&mdash;so
pretty much everything is my duty." She stood up. "Come on,
let's go the clubroom, and I'll show you."</p><p class="standard">I
followed Lily up the stairs to the third floor, where there were lots
of empty offices and lounges. The elementary school building had lots
of empty rooms, because we didn't have as many teachers, tutors, and
coaches as the other schools. Elementary school students weren't
allowed to start their own clubs, although the teachers had started
lots of clubs that we were allowed to join, like the literature club,
the music club, and the natural sciences club. Elementary school
students could also join high school clubs if we could find a high
school student to sponsor us and get permission from the club's
adviser and our teacher.</p><p class="standard">I
had thought about joining a club as my next move to make friends, so
I had read all about
them in the handbook.</p><p class="standard">Lily
took us down the hall to the wooden door of a lounge. A manila
envelope hung on the wall next to the door, pinned up with a
thumbtack. "This is my mailbox," she said, looking inside.
"Still nothing. Looks like no one needs help today." She
took a key from the pocket of her overalls and unlocked the door.
"Come inside, and we'll have some tea."</p><p class="standard">Inside, the room was similar to the teacher's lounge, where I had
gone a few times to see Miss Hanover before or after class, but
unlike the noisy and crowded teacher's lounge, decorated with posters
with all sorts of boring grown-up jokes on them, it was still and
silent, and Lily had decorated every inch of the wall with plants and
flowers. An arrangement of climbing flower crown vines wound all the
way around the upper parts of the wall, filling the room with a fresh
scent. Off to my left was a little counter with a sink, a teapot, and
some dishes and utensils, also surrounded by flowers. In the center
was a little wooden table with two chairs and a vase of flowers set
atop it. White gossamer curtains swayed over a pair of tall bay
windows at the far end of the room. The teacher's lounge had the same
window seats, and I had always wanted to go sit on them and absorb
the sunlight while reading. I didn't have a book with me now, but I
still took my chance to go sit on them and absorb the sunlight while
Lily made tea.</p><p class="standard">"Do
you like milk and sugar in your tea, Nora?" Lily asked.</p><p class="standard">"No,
thank you. Plain for me, please," I said as I climbed into the
window seat. From here you could see across the campus, all the way
to the high school building and beyond to the mountains. The high
school soccer team was practicing on the field, moving around like
tiny ants in the distance, chasing a ball I couldn't see.</p><p class="standard">When
the tea was done, I went to climb down from the window seat, but Lily
said, "You can stay there if you like" with a smile, so I
took my cup and saucer up into the window with me and drank tea while
looking out across the school.</p><p class="standard">"It's
too bad we can't see the garden from here," I said. "I bet
it would look amazing from this height."</p><p class="standard">When
my tea was gone, I came down from the window seat and washed my cup
and saucer in the sink and put them out to dry on the dish towel. "So
what do you do in this club?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"It's
the tea-drinking club," said Lily.</p><p class="standard">"Eh?
They allow clubs like that?"</p><p class="standard">"Only
joking. I actually made this club to gather together people with all
sorts of gifts, and pair them up with someone who needs their help."</p><p class="standard">"I...don't
understand," I admitted.</p><p class="standard">"Well,
everyone in this school has a gift, even if they don't know what it
is yet. And somewhere out there, maybe there's a person who needs
help from someone with that gift. Maybe someone out there is having
trouble growing food that they need to feed their family. Then I
might be able to help them with my Gift of Gardening. Or maybe
someone is sick and isn't getting better. Then one of my friends from
the high school might be able to help them with his Gift of
Strengthening. We all have gifts, and even though some of them might
seem useless,
they can all be useful to the right person."</p><p class="standard">"Like
the milk thistle," I suggested. "Even though it might be a
weed to someone trying to grow roses, it could be medicine to someone
with mushroom poisoning."</p><p class="standard">Lily
smiled. Her smile was so beautiful and gentle that I always felt a
tingle in my back when I saw it, and it made me feel like smiling
too. "Exactly," she said. "So, do you want to join?"</p><p class="standard">"Me?
But I don't have any gift yet."</p><p class="standard">"That's
not true," said Lily. "Even if you don't have any power
like my Gift of Gardening yet, you still have gifts that only you can
offer to someone in need."</p><p class="standard">Just
as I was about to respond, the door opened. Standing there, with a
slight blush on her face, a cake box in her hand, her cat ears
standing straight up, her orange-and-white pigtails decorated with
yellow ribbons and her glasses fogged up around the corners, was
Cora.</p><p class="standard">She
began to smile at Lily, but then caught sight of me and looked
disappointed.</p><p class="standard">Hiding
behind my bangs suddenly wasn't good enough, so I quickly got up and
pulled the curtains in front of me, and shut my eyes tight.</p><p class="standard">"I
can still see you, idiot," Cora said. I heard her set the cake
box on the table and I opened my eyes. These curtains really were
easy to see through. Nonetheless, I stayed behind them, pulling them
closer around me to hide my feet.</p><p class="standard">"Hi,
Cora," said Lily. "What brings you here?"</p><p class="standard">Cora's
tone of voice became completely different as she said, "I
brought this cake for you! I was hoping we could, um, maybe eat it
together."</p><p class="standard">Lily
opened the box and looked inside. "That looks delicious."</p><p class="standard">"Doesn't
it?" Cora agreed.</p><p class="standard">"And
there should be enough here for Nora to have some."</p><p class="standard">"Ye...yeah,
I guess so..."</p><p class="standard">"But
we only have two chairs. Let me go look in some of the other rooms
and see if I can find another one," said Lily, getting up from
the table. "Nora, won't you help Cora make tea and cut the
cake?"</p><p class="standard">"Um,
s-sure," I stuttered. I poked my face out from the curtains and
saw Cora getting a knife and beginning to cut the cake, looking
annoyed all the while. When she had left the counter with a knife, I
went over there and began to make tea.</p><p class="standard">Lily
had a self-heating teapot, so we didn't need to have a stove in the
room to heat water. All I had to do was fill the teapot with water,
put it on the heat-absorbing tile, and twist the little red ball at
the top, and the teapot would heat the water inside. I started the
water heating, then turned around to see Cora glaring at me and
jumped.</p><p class="standard">"Let's
be clear about this," said Cora. "I'm only sharing this
with you because of Lily. Otherwise I wouldn't give you any."</p><p class="standard">I
reached for the nearest curtains and hid behind them again. "O-of
course, I know that. Y-you told me you didn't want to be
f-f-f-friends with me and I g-got the message..."</p><p class="standard">"Well,
as long as you understand, that's okay. But I guess it's not that bad
that you're here.
It gives me the chance to apologize."</p><p class="standard">"Huh?"
I was confused, and peeked out from behind the curtains to see Cora
polishing her glasses on her shirt, looking away from me as if she
were embarrassed.</p><p class="standard">"I'm
sorry about what I said the other day. I still don't want to be
friends with you, but the stuff I said was too mean. Sorry."</p><p class="standard">I
came out from behind the curtains and stepped closer to Cora.
"I...accept your apology. I guess it was a little too forward of
me to just come up and ask you to be my friend like that."</p><p class="standard">"That's
right! I had no idea what to say when you just popped off like that,
so my true feelings just came out," said Cora. "But saying
all that was too mean, and I felt bad afterward. So I apologize."</p><p class="standard">I
somehow felt like she was still insulting me, but I appreciated the
intentions behind what she was saying. "I thought maybe you were
mad at me about the soccer game," I said.</p><p class="standard">"That
was obviously an accident! Everyone just got too worked up. At least
you were trying. Some girls hate sports so much they just stand in
the middle of the field like lawn gnomes, and that's the kind of girl
that really makes me mad. Besides, I win so much at sports that
losing one stupid PE soccer game is nothing to me. I don't give a
rat's tail about that."</p><p class="standard">Hearing
that made me think that Cora really was a nice person after all, so I
made tea for the three of us and sat down to talk with her while we
waited for Lily to come back. </p><p class="standard">"Um,
how did you become friends with Lily?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">Cora
put her glasses back on and started playing with her own tail,
holding it and swirling the tip around her finger. "We met two
years ago, when Lily was still here in the elementary school,"
she said. "My teacher back then, Mr. Grayson, was making us just
read and read and read. He had us sit there at our desks for two
hours, just reading this stupid book he loved. You probably know what
it is&mdash;U something, by some Irish guy."</p><p class="standard">Even
though I had read a lot of books, I wasn't a library database, so I
couldn't figure out what book it was from such a vague description. I
shook my head, and Cora went on.</p><p class="standard">"Anyway,
after two hours Mr. Grayson told us if we couldn't reach page fifteen
by lunchtime, we'd have to sit there in the classroom through lunch
until we got there. I was already starting to get hungry, and my head
hurt from all that reading, and my legs were itching to get outside
and run. When he said that, it made me mad, so I threw the book at
the window and ran out of the classroom."</p><p class="standard">After
an incident like that, it was amazing that Cora hadn't been labeled
an angry, violent person and left out of the class like me.</p><p class="standard">"After
I ran around the grounds a little bit, I worked out all my anger and
was starting to think that I should go back to the classroom and
apologize, but I was afraid that Mr. Grayson would be mad at me and
I'd get in trouble. As I was walking around wondering what to do,
Lily found me."</p><p class="standard">"I
asked her why she wasn't in class and she said she had permission
from her teacher to come to the garden during certain activities. She
asked me why I wasn't in class, and I told her what had happened.
Lily said when people get mad at someone, they'll first be angry
about
whatever happened to make them mad, then they'll stop being mad after
they have time to cool off. But if the person they're mad at doesn't
apologize, then after a while they'll get mad at that person again
for not apologizing. She said Mr. Grayson had probably just stopped
being mad, and she would come with me to apologize to him before he
got mad at me again for not apologizing."</p><p class="standard">"Lily
walked me back to class and went with me to apologize to Mr. Grayson.
I told him I was sorry and I would take any punishment he wanted to
give me for what I did. But Mr. Grayson admitted that he might have
been unreasonable, and he said we could all go to lunch and he'd give
us some time the next day to read up to page fifteen."</p><p class="standard">"After
I saw how amazing Lily is, I wanted to be her friend, but I somehow
get embarrassed and can't be myself when she's around, so we never
managed to get close."</p><p class="standard">"Don't
worry," I said. "I'm sure Lily wants to be friends with you
too. After all, you told her all about getting angry and throwing the
book at the window, so she knows that you're a violent and brutal
person, yet she hasn't abandoned you."</p><p class="standard">"You
little&mdash;!" Cora snarled, and I jumped up and hid behind the
curtains again.</p><p class="standard">"Are
you two getting along well?" Lily asked as she came in carrying
a chair, followed by Miss Hanover, also carrying a chair.</p><p class="standard">"Miss
Hanover? What are you doing here?" asked Cora.</p><p class="standard">"Hello
Cora, Nora. I'm this club's faculty adviser," said Miss Hanover.</p><p class="standard">"I
asked her where I could find a chair," said Lily, "and when
she heard there was cake, she insisted on coming to advise the club."</p><p class="standard">I
left the sanctuary of the curtains and made a cup of tea for Miss
Hanover too, and we sat down to have cake together.</p><p class="standard">"By
the way, Cora, were you able to finish that book in the extra time
that Mr. Grayson gave you?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"No.
I think I gave up the twenty-third time I had to read page two, and
just started drawing in the margins."</p><p class="standard">"Are
you talking about <i>Ulysses</i>,
by James Joyce?" Miss Hanover asked.</p><p class="standard">"Yes."</p><p class="standard">Miss Hanover and Lily
exchanged knowing looks. "Do you want to tell her, Lily?"
Miss Hanover said.</p><p class="standard">"It was your
idea," said Lily.</p><p class="standard">Miss Hanover took a
sip of tea and said, "Cora, after Lily told me how the two of
you met, I started to ask Mr. Grayson some questions about the book
he was having his class read. After a while I could tell that he had
no idea at all what the book was about. I told him I didn't think it
was right to make his fourth-grade class read a book that many
adults, including him, can't understand."</p><p class="standard">"So he stopped
making his class read that book?" Cora asked.</p><p class="standard">"No.
He said if his fourth-grade teacher had made him read it, then today
he'd be able to understand it just fine. But since he had no idea
what the book was about anyway, I waited a few days and then showed
him an order form saying that he'd ordered the wrong book. So he
reordered everything, and nowadays his class reads <i>The
Adventures of Odysseus </i>and
they can all reach page fifteen by lunch."</p><p class="standard">Cora's face lit up,
and she stood up and threw her arms around Miss Hanover, quickly
letting go again. Then she took Lily's and Miss Hanover's plates and
served them the two extra pieces of cake we'd ended up with when we
cut it.</p><p class="standard">"Somehow, this
gives me a nice warm feeling inside," I said</p><p class="standard">Miss Hanover and Lily
smiled, but Cora scowled and started cleaning her glasses. "That's
just your twice-baked brain," she said.</p><p class="standard">Her glasses get dirty
a lot.</p><p class="standard">By the way, later,
after Miss Hanover left, I told Lily I would love to join her club.
Cora chimed in and said she would too, so Lily's club got two new
members. I'm not sure what gift I can offer to help others, but I'll
do whatever I can.</p>

      <h2 class="heading"><a id="My_rival">My

      <img src="myrival2.jpg" />
      <div class="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard">How
are you? I'm Cora.</p><p class="standard">You
probably have a bad image of me because of what that creampuff Nora
said about the first time we met, so let me set the record straight. </p><p class="standard">First,
Nora is a teacher's pet, klutz, and creampuff who hides behind Miss
Hanover, the curtains, or whatever else is handy. I can hardly
believe that we're the same age, because she acts like she still
sometimes needs to wear diapers. </p><p class="standard">Second,
I never hugged Miss Hanover. That didn't happen. I'm not a teacher's
pet creampuff like Nora is, so I wouldn't have done that.</p><p class="standard">Third,
I really did feel just a little bit like I might have gone too far
when I turned down her friendship in class that time, so I decided to
put up with her even though she's always in the way whenever I try to
become better friends with Lily. Lily is nice to everyone, so when
that creampuff came to her whining about not having any friends, she
graciously agreed to be  friends and entertain that klutz every day
in her clubroom.</p><p class="standard">It
made me a little jealous that Nora had accomplished in two minutes
what I'd spent two years trying to do, but I really did feel just a
little bit bad for telling Nora what I did, so I decided to apologize
and put up with her, hoping that I could use her as a stepping stone
to get closer to Lily.</p><p class="standard">Thanks
to her, I ended up joining Lily's club. I'm not very clear on what
this club does, but if it means I can become better friends with
Lily, then I'm okay with it. If it means being in this club with
Lily, I'm even willing to try and be friends with Nora. I'm even
willing to talk to her in class, if it means that she'll say good
things about me to Lily.</p><p class="standard">This
story isn't about Nora, although she does have a part to play in it.
A very small, ignominious part. She screams, hides, flaps, flails,
and wets herself, along with nearly killing me, herself, and the
person I'm about to tell you about. This person is someone who annoys
me even more than Nora.</p><p class="standard">That
day, I decided to try talking to Nora in class. I knew this would
either make or break my reputation. Either everyone would decide that
Nora wasn't so bad, and they would all look up to me for being smart
and nice enough to see it, or they would throw me on the creampuff
tray with her and no one in class would ever talk to me again.</p><p class="standard">I
knew all this, and yet I still went to talk to her before class. I'm
really brave and nice, aren't I? I'm sure you can see that now. Got
it? I'm nothing like the violent, brutal, and mean girl that Nora
probably told you all about.</p><p class="standard">When
I came into the classroom that morning, Miss Hanover hadn't arrived
yet, but some of the other kids were there. I went to my desk and set
down my backpack.</p><p class="standard">"Hi
Cora," said Willow, the girl who sat next to me.</p><p class="standard">"Hi,"
I said.</p><p class="standard">"Did
you finish your homework?"</p><p class="standard">"Yeah."</p><p class="standard">"Can
I copy it?"</p><p class="standard">I
let Willow copy it. There was no way that Miss Hanover wouldn't
figure it out. Even without her Gift of Trickery, which let her see
through lies and cheats as well as lie and cheat like a champ
herself, she could have just noted the fact that all my answers were
wrong, and all of Willow's were wrong too, except for the few I had
gotten right, which would also be the few that Willow had gotten
right.</p><p class="standard">Still,
I'm such a nice person that I let Willow copy. I left her to it and
started moving down the rows of desks towards Nora's desk. We both
sat in the far column, next to the windows, but my desk was closer to
the front than hers.</p><p class="standard">Having
two sets of ears means I can hear really well, and I can turn my cat
ears to pick up sounds all around me. That's how I knew that Willow
had stopped copying my homework and was whispering with another girl.
They were wondering where I was going. </p><p class="standard">I
tuned them out and kept going, finally stopping at Nora's desk. Nora
looked up at me with surprise.</p><p class="standard">"Hi,"
I said.</p><p class="standard">"H-hello..."
Nora replied, her mouth full of marshmallows as usual, and then she
went back to her book.</p><p class="standard">Something
about this made me really mad, and I wanted to yell at her, but I
reminded myself that she could be my one-way ticket to friendship
with Lily, so I held myself back. The desk next to her was empty, so
I sat down in it and tried to smile. "What are you reading?"
I asked.</p><p class="standard">Nora
showed me the cover. <i>On the Banks of Plum Creek</i>,
it said, and there was a picture of a river out in a prairie
somewhere, a horse and a plum tree at its edge.</p><p class="standard">"Is it good?"</p><p class="standard">"Uh-huh. It's
very interesting."</p><p class="standard">"Good. See you."</p><p class="standard">"Uh-huh."</p><p class="standard">I stood up and
returned to my own desk. "What was that about?" asked
Willow when I got back.</p><p class="standard">"Nothing."</p><p class="standard">"She almost
totally ignored you! Are you gonna let that teacher's pet get away
with that? I'm gonna go make sure she understands what her position
is." Willow got up, but I took her by the arm and shook my head.</p><p class="standard">"Leave her
alone," I said. "She's a drool-headed creampuff, but she's
not that bad. Just leave her alone."</p><p class="standard">Willow sat down again,
looking skeptical. "Why'd you go talk to her anyway?" she
asked.</p><p class="standard">"I found out
we're in the same club," I said, "so I thought we should be
friends."</p><p class="standard">"Looks like she
didn't think so," said Willow.</p><p class="standard">That was true, but I
didn't want to hear it from Willow, who was so dumb she was copying
the dumbest person in class's homework, so I said, "You'd better
finish copying that before Miss Hanover gets here", and Willow
forgot all about Nora.</p><p class="standard">I went to the clubroom
after school intending to give that creampuff a piece of my mind. She
knew it, too, because when I came in she was hiding behind the
curtains again, up in the window seat. Lily wasn't here yet&mdash;the
middle school classes let out a bit later than the elementary school
classes, and she had to walk over from the middle school building,
too, so I'd expected to have a few minutes to take care of this
before she came.</p><p class="standard">"Hey! What was
that about this morning?" I asked. </p><p class="standard">She didn't say
anything.</p><p class="standard">"I try to talk to
you and you just blow me off?" I pulled the curtains aside.
"Come on, you're not fooling anyone by hi&mdash;"</p><p class="standard">She was asleep.</p><p class="standard">Somehow she'd managed
to fall asleep in the five minutes she'd been here before me,
snoozing on the windowsill with drool all over her face and a book on
her stomach. It was the same one from this morning, <i>On the Banks
of Plum Creek</i>.</p><p class="standard">I picked the book up
and looked at it. "What is so interesting about this garbage? I
don't understand." I read the back cover. Some garbage about a
pioneer family living on the plains and braving the winter and
mountain lions, or something. As a cat, I was on the mountain lions'
side, so if I read this, I would be hoping for the family to get
eaten the whole time.</p><p class="standard">As I was looking at
her garbage, Nora woke up and saw me. As soon as she realized who was
standing over her while she slept, she jumped and tried to hide
behind the curtains.</p><p class="standard">"Hey! What was
the deal with this morning?" I demanded. "I tried to talk
to you, and you just blew me off!"</p><p class="standard">"I...I just
didn't know what to say," Nora gibbered. "I didn't expect
you to talk to me in class...I thought you'd be worried...about what
the other kids would think..."</p><p class="standard">"So you thought I
was the sort of person who would just ignore you in class and try to
hide the fact that we know each other? Apologize to me right away!"</p><p class="standard">"I'm sorryyyy!"
Nora squealed like a piglet. </p><p class="standard">"You don't know
me at all! When I say I'll do something, I do it, and I said I would
talk to you, so I will."</p><p class="standard">Nora looked at me
stupidly. "What?" I demanded. "Are you going to start
crying?"</p><p class="standard">"No...but...When
did you tell me you'd talk to me, Cora?"</p><p class="standard">I thought back. I
never actually had.</p><p class="standard">"It was implicit!
Implicit in the talk we had yesterday! You should have been able to
figure it out even without being told directly!" I tossed her
book down on the window seat next to her and went to sit down and
wait for Lily. "I'm not talking to you anymore."</p><p class="standard">About ten minutes
later&mdash;ten minutes of sitting in strained silence as Nora read
her book and drooled, or whatever she does while reading&mdash;Lily
came in with Ms. Rutherford, the girls' PE teacher for the elementary
school, in her usual mauve jogging suit.</p><p class="standard">"Ms. Rutherford
is looking for some help clearing one of the PE sheds," said
Lily. "Since  our club's purpose is to help people, she came to
us for help."</p><p class="standard">I felt like telling
Ms. Rutherford to go find someone with the Gift of Dust Disappearance
and leave us alone, but I couldn't be so bad-mannered in front of
Lily, so I said, "We can do that, can't we, Nora?"</p><p class="standard">"Um, y-yes,"
Nora sputtered as usual.</p><p class="standard">"Just give us a
chance to change out of our school clothes," I said.</p><p class="standard">"We'll wait here
for you," said Lily. "Would you care for some tea, Ms.
Rutherford?"</p><p class="standard">Lily served tea to the
old hag as Nora and I left the room. "Now listen, and don't
forget this," I said once we were out of earshot. "I am a
nice, kind, generous person. Just like Lily. Right?"</p><p class="standard">Nora looked skeptical,
but she said, "Right."</p><p class="standard">"So from now on,
talk to me just like you would talk to Lily. That's an order."</p><p class="standard">"Aye-aye, sir..."</p><p class="standard">We went off to our
rooms to change. My roommate, Victoria, was lying on the top bunk and
listening to opera on the radio when I came in. I got my gym shorts
and an old, ratty T-shirt and went into the bathroom to change.</p><p class="standard">"Ranta?"
Victoria asked when I came out.</p><p class="standard">"Club," I
said.</p><p class="standard">"Have a good
time."</p><p class="standard">That was what I liked
about Victoria&mdash;she didn't pry into things. What I disliked
about her was her habit of waking up at five in the morning and
singing opera in the shower for forty-five minutes, even on weekends.
She has the Gift of Voice, so she can create some pretty weird sounds
with her voice. She once broke my glasses by singing a high note. My
parents were angry at me, and gave me the lecture about not
appreciating all the hard work they went through to earn their money,
and they didn't believe me when I said my roommate had broken them
with her voice.</p><p class="standard">I met up with Nora,
who had changed into some grungy old jeans and a T-shirt, and we went
back to the clubroom for Lily and Ms. Rutherford.</p><p class="standard">Ms. Rutherford led us
down to the shed we would be clearing. It was an old wooden building
by the field, the paint chipping off and the door hinges rusty. Ms.
Rutherford gave Lily the keys.</p><p class="standard">"Please return
them to the faculty office when you're done," she said. "Be
careful; the shed is infested with hornets. I'd like you to take all
the equipment out and move it to the shed across the way there, and
then we'll call in someone to handle the hornets."</p><p class="standard">It seemed to me that
things were going in the wrong order here, but Ms. Rutherford was
gone before anyone could say anything. I knew there was a reason I
never liked that woman.</p><p class="standard"></p><p class="standard">Lily, who kept bees in
her garden, suggested we set up the hose before we started so we
could spray at the hornets if they attacked us. She also told us to
move slowly and quietly to try not to surprise them. It would be
better, she said, if we could blow some smoke at them to calm them
down before we started, but since we were kids we weren't allowed to
have anything that could make smoke.</p><p class="standard">I dragged a hose over
from the nearest faucet, turned the water on, and crimped it towards
the end so the water wouldn't keep on running while we were working,
and then Lily unlocked the shed and we got started.</p><p class="standard">I could hear the
buzzing as soon as the door opened, but I tried to ignore it and tell
myself it was just the cheers of roaring fans as I bravely led the
way into the dark, dusty old shed. Most of the equipment inside was
for soccer. Stood up in the corner was a bundle of the pipes used to
make the goals. The nets were stored in mesh bags next to them. To my
right were two wooden barrels filled with balls. There was also some
general equipment like jerseys and cleats and whistles, and a few
track accessories like starting blocks. It looked like it was going
to take us a while to move all of this, especially since we had to
move slowly to avoid waking up the hornets.</p><p class="standard">"That old witch
is totally bullying us," I muttered as I tiptoed towards the
corner to grab the goals and the bag of nets. Lily and Nora followed
me in and started looking around for things to move.</p><p class="standard">Since Lily worked in
the garden so much, she was pretty strong, so she helped me move the
goals while Nora took the smaller stuff like cleats and whistles. We
decided to just leave everything outside for now so we could move it
all off to the other shed without worrying about the hornets. Once
we'd moved the goals out, Lily took over the smaller equipment while
Nora and I started on the balls. There was no way we could move those
barrels, even with all three of us, so we decided to just carry the
balls out one by one and leave the barrels inside.</p><p class="standard">As soon as Nora, that
klutz, lifted a ball off the top of the barrel, a cloud of hornets,
disturbed from their place of rest, came flying up at her face. I
could see her about to scream and ruin everything.</p><p class="standard">I quickly jumped into
action, grabbing her from behind and clamping my hand over her mouth.
She stopped, and I whispered, "I'm going to back out of this
shed. Just like this. Blink if you understand."</p><p class="standard">She blinked, although
I wasn't sure if she really understood or just had dust in her eye. I
started backing out anyway, my left hand over Nora's mouth, my right
hand on her shoulder, guiding her to match my movements. We slowly
backed towards the door, coming out onto the grass without disturbing
the hornets, and I took my hand off of Nora's mouth.</p><p class="standard">"Whew," Nora
sighed, and she went over and dropped the ball on top of the other
equipment&mdash;and hornets surged out of it.</p><p class="standard">I couldn't believe
it&mdash;the hornets were living inside the ball.</p><p class="standard">There was no time to
think. Nora started screaming and flailing, and I didn't want her to
wake up the other hornets. I grabbed the hose, undid the crimp, and
with my thumb over the end to spread the stream, sprayed all over
Nora and the hornets.</p><p class="standard">The hornets didn't
seem to be very bothered by the hose, but I kept spraying them
anyway. They did seem to go out of their way to avoid being sprayed,
so as long as I sprayed around Nora, I could keep them off of her for
a while.</p><p class="standard">Lily came out of the
shed with a mesh ball bag over her head and another one in her hands.
She ran up to Nora, taking some spray in the process (I tried not to
hit her, but even I can't aim a hose with my thumb over the end very
well), and put the mesh bag over Nora's head. At first I couldn't
figure out what she was doing, but then I realized that the mesh bags
looked a lot like the netting that beekeepers wear to keep bees off
of them while they're working in the hive.</p><p class="standard">Lily's a genius.</p><p class="standard">I grabbed another one
of the mesh bags and charged in, bravely, I might add (and do add),
and threw the hornet-infested ball inside it, drawing the strings as
tightly as I could. That sealed most of them inside the bag. I put
another one over my head, like Lily had done, and chased off the rest
of them using the hose.</p><p class="standard">"That old biddy,"
I cursed at Ms. Rutherford as I sprayed off the last of the hornets,
wishing I could have her right here to spray in the face instead.</p><p class="standard">"What's going
on?" asked the last person whose voice I wanted to hear right
now.</p><p class="standard">I pulled the bag off
my head and turned around to face her. She was looking all smug like
usual, with her rugged olive skin, her hair cut all short and boyish,
walking up to us in her gym shorts and shirt like some kind of
bigshot.</p><p class="standard">Ranta, my rival.</p><p class="standard">"Nothing," I
said, even though that was obviously a lie. Here we were, me with a
hose, all three of us with mesh bags over our heads, yelling and
flapping in the middle of the field. Nora had somehow gotten trapped
inside her mesh bag and was rolling around on the grass trying to get
free.</p><p class="standard">Ranta didn't even
blink; she walked straight over to Nora and freed that klutz from the
bag, then helped her to her feet. "Are you all right?" she
asked.</p><p class="standard">"Th-thank you..."
Nora stammered.</p><p class="standard">"Do you need some
help finishing this?" Ranta asked, looking around at us.</p><p class="standard">"No!" I
insisted.</p><p class="standard">"Yes," Lily
and Nora contradicted me.</p><p class="standard">There wasn't much left
to do, so having Ranta helping didn't really mean anything, but Nora
still acted like she was some kind of superhuman and kept buzzing
around her and chattering, like a honeybee and a honeysuckle.</p><p class="standard">We finished moving
everything out of the hornet shed (except for the balls, which we
left along with a note to be careful of them) and into the other
shed, and were just about to go up to the faculty room and return the
keys when I heard Lily say something shocking to Ranta.</p><p class="standard">"You're Ranta,
right? The ace of the track team? I heard they stopped letting you
compete when they found out your gift was the Gift of Running. Would
you ever think about joining our club?"</p><p class="standard">"No!" I
butted in. "Ranta would never think about joining this club.
It's not good enough for a high and mighty rich girl like her."</p><p class="standard">"I would like to
join," said Ranta, "but Cora might throw a tantrum, so I'd
better not. She's really such a whiny crybaby."</p><p class="standard">"You're confusing
me with Nora over there," I said. Then I saw Nora looking like
she was about to start crying. Crying because someone called you a
crybaby is exactly what it means to be a crybaby.</p><p class="standard">"Really, she's so
unpleasant. I don't know why you tolerate her," said Ranta,
crossing her arms in a haughty way as she spoke. "Lily, I have
an idea. Why don't you and Nora throw Cora out of the club, and I'll
replace her? It won't be long before you see that I'm stronger,
smarter, and nicer than she is."</p><p class="standard">I bit my lip. I really
wanted to say something, but I was afraid I'd already ruined myself
in Lily's eyes. Nora looked like she wanted to use Ranta's idea, but
Lily stood up for me.</p><p class="standard">"Cora has good
things about her. She can be a little rambunctious, but she has a
good heart."</p><p class="standard">Oh, Lily...I knew you
wanted to be friends with me...I'm touched. </p><p class="standard">"By the way,
Cora, I thought you might want to know that you were eating my dust
in the last mile run. Seven minutes and sixteen seconds. Soon I'll be
down to the five minute mile of Lawrence of Arabia. What was your
time again? Nine minutes? Were you hopping on one leg the entire
time?"</p><p class="standard">"You have the
Gift of Running! Obviously any competition where your gift gives you
an unfair advantage doesn't count!"</p><p class="standard">"The words of a
true loser. Since you're a born loser, Cora, you'll lose no matter
what we compete in. So go ahead, pick something. I'll prove to you
that you can't win against me."</p><p class="standard">"Soccer!" I
yelled. "I bet you can't score one goal against me in soccer!
Tomorrow, after school. Be here, ready to lose against me!"</p><p class="standard">"Fine. I'll prove
one more time that I'm better at sports than you are," said
Ranta, her arms crossed in that infuriating way. "See you
tomorrow Lily, Nora. I hope you'll cheer for me." With that, she
left.</p><p class="standard">"She's pretty
gutsy, asking people from Cora's club to cheer for her in a match
against Cora," Lily commented.</p><p class="standard">I ground my teeth in
fury. Tomorrow, I swore, would be the day I made Ranta get down on
her hands and knees and bow to me!</p><p class="standard"><br /></p><p class="standard">The next day, during
lunch, I went to the library to look for Nora.</p><p class="standard">We hadn't spoken at
all that morning; I'd been up late thinking about all the
embarrassing things I was going to force Ranta to do when I won, and
I hadn't gotten up the first time my alarm clock went off, so I had
just barely gotten to class on time and hadn't had a chance. When
lunch started, Nora ran off before I could catch her, and I hadn't
seen her in the dining hall, so I assumed she was at the library. </p><p class="standard">The main library was a
huge castle-like building over by the high school. I didn't think
Nora would have time to walk over there, so I walked across the
courtyard to the smaller elementary school library. I'd never had
much use for the place, so I didn't really know how many books were
in it, but even a book freak like Nora couldn't have read all of
them.</p><p class="standard">I wasn't spending so
much time looking for Nora because I enjoyed her company. The truth
was, I might have gotten myself in too deep. As a cat, I can jump and
climb and roll better than any human, which makes me a good
goalkeeper in soccer; but Ranta's Gift of Running made her a brutal
kicker, since she could build up so much speed before hitting the
ball. I needed to be sure I could win. Anything, even the smallest
advantage, could give me the match.</p><p class="standard">What? Don't look at me
like that. I'm not a cheater. This is something I would never do to
anyone but Ranta. I'm actually doing her a favor, by teaching her
that I'm better than she is.</p><p class="standard">I went into the
library and started looking around for Nora, checking all the tables
and in between all the shelves. The library was pretty empty at this
time, since most people over here don't love books enough to run off
during lunch and read them. That's why when I moved towards the back
corner, I heard their voices right away.</p><p class="standard">It was Nora, and
Ranta.</p><p class="standard">They were sitting
together in the window seat, like the one in the clubroom where I'd
found Nora sleeping. They were sitting close together, and a huge
leather-bound book was laid across their legs, with Nora holding the
left side and Ranta holding the right side. The title was <i>The
Poetry of William Blake</i>. Nora was reading out of it, and Ranta
was listening and following along.</p><p class="standard">"'Tyger, tyger,
burning bright, in the forest of the night,'" Nora read. "'What
immortal hand or eye, dare frame thy'&mdash;" She stopped when she
saw me. "Oh...Cora..."</p><p class="standard">Something about her
reaction made me mad. It was like she was disappointed to see me. I
scowled at her. "Come with me. I need to talk to you."</p><p class="standard">"Oh. Okay. Um,
I'll be back in a minute, Ranta."</p><p class="standard">"I'll be right here,"
said Ranta.</p><p class="standard">I led Nora back to the
front of the library, where we wouldn't be heard. "What are you
doing?" I asked. "Don't you realize she's the enemy?"</p><p class="standard">"She was n-nice
to me y-yesterday," Nora stammered, her mouth as always full of
marshmallows. "And she l-likes books, s-so I said we should
r-read together sometime..."</p><p class="standard">"Fine, well,
forget about that. I want you to help me with something."</p><p class="standard">Nora looked sullen,
but she nodded her head.</p><p class="standard">What was with this
difference in treatment? It made me mad somehow.</p><p class="standard">"Actually, this
could be even better. I want you to go to the PE shed before the
match and pick out the ball. Try to find one that's kind of flat.
That way it won't have as much force when Ranta kicks it, and I'll
have a better chance of being able to stop it. Ranta trusts you, so
she'll never think you did anything to the ball."</p><p class="standard">"That's
cheating!" Nora flared, like a creampuff on fire. "I don't
want to cheat Ranta!"</p><p class="standard">"Shut up! Just do
it! Listen, you don't understand what kind of person Ranta is. Ever
since we were little, she's always thought she was better than
everyone else because she's rich and good at sports. It got even
worse after she found out what her gift was. This is really for her
own good. If she loses, she'll stop thinking she's better than
everyone else and become a better person in the end. Don't you think
that's a great plan?"</p><p class="standard">"No," said
Nora.</p><p class="standard">I couldn't believe
this slimy little tadpole was disagreeing with me, so I just snarled,
"Do it. Or else I won't talk to you in class."</p><p class="standard">For a second, Nora
looked like she might have more to say, but she finally nodded and
then turned around and left without saying a word. "And don't
tell Lily!" I added to Nora's back. Lily was too good a person,
so she would stop me if she knew about this.</p><p class="standard"></p><br /><p class="standard">By the time of the
match, I felt pretty bad about the way I'd treated Nora in the
library. She made me mad, but I was still a lot meaner to her than
I'd wanted to be. I felt especially bad about my threat not to talk
to her in class. I didn't really want to talk to her at all, but it
wasn't fair for me to talk to her only when I needed her for
something, so the second I'd asked her for a favor, I had lost the
right to not talk to her.</p><p class="standard">I put on my gym shorts
and my soccer jersey, tied my hair up in a ponytail at the back of my
head, and pulled on my shin guards, gloves, and cleats in my room
before going down. When Victoria saw me, she asked, "Club?",
and I replied, "Ranta." Victoria nodded and left it at
that.</p><p class="standard">Ranta and some of her
obnoxious friends had already arrived at the field when I came, and
so had Lily, but Nora wasn't there yet. Normally, we wouldn't have
been allowed to use the school's equipment for something like this
since it wasn't a school activity, but I had asked Ms. Rutherford and
she had allowed it, so the PE shed where we'd moved everything
yesterday was unlocked.</p><p class="standard">Ranta's friends
erupted in a chorus of booing and whistling when they saw me. They
were all rich girls, and they couldn't stand the idea of a commoner
like me challenging their champion, the snobbiest and most stuck up
of all the rich girls in this school.</p><p class="standard">"I don't really
know why this is necessary, but good luck to both of you," said
Lily.</p><p class="standard">The goal had already
been set up, so I took my place in front of it and stared into the
eyes of my enemy as we waited for Nora to get there with the ball.</p><p class="standard">"That creampuff,"
I muttered. "What's taking her so long?"</p><p class="standard">Nora finally arrived,
carrying a soccer ball in a mesh bag. She walked to where Ranta was
standing and placed the ball at Ranta's feet, then went to Lily's
side.</p><p class="standard">Ranta started to back
up. It looked like she was planning to use pure force to try and get
the ball past me as fast as possible so I wouldn't have time to stop
it. She was in for a nasty surprise.</p><p class="standard">I took a solid stance,
planted my feet, my arms out to the sides, my tail swishing, my ears
standing high. I heard a strange buzzing sound. I craned my ears
forward more.</p><p class="standard">That idiot!</p><p class="standard">Wait!"
I screamed as Ranta ran in. "Don't kick that ball!"</p><p class="standard">She ignored me and
kicked it anyway. </p><p class="standard">As soon as her foot
hit it, hornets came surging out of the ball, buzzing around angrily.
Ranta's friends screamed and scattered all over the place. Ranta
herself just stared for a second, her mouth wide open in
astonishment.</p><p class="standard">"Run!" I
screamed.</p><p class="standard">Lily, Nora, Ranta, and
I all took off. Since the other girls had already run off, the
hornets chased us.</p><p class="standard">We ran across the
field as fast as we could, the buzzing cloud hot on our heels. Nora
started to fall behind at one point, and Ranta stopped and heaved her
up on her back and kept running, carrying that creampuff piggy-back. </p><p class="standard">"Go for the
pool!" said Lily. "We can hide there until they lose
interest!"</p><p class="standard">The middle school's
pool was about thirty yards away, well within reach. But come on, a
cat in a pool? Maybe a tiger could take it, but for a tabby like me,
getting soaked in water was about as much fun as going to the
dentist.</p><p class="standard">But maybe it was
better than being chased by angry hornets. </p><p class="standard">I could see there was
a lock on the gate from far away, but we'd managed to gain about
twenty feet on the hornets, so there was time to deal with that. A
plum tree stood next to the fence, its branches reaching over the
fence. I took Nora from Ranta and clambered up the plum tree, over
the fence, and down on the other side with that creampuff clinging to
my back the whole time.</p><p class="standard">"Get in!" I
yelled, tossing her into the pool. There was a cover on it, but Nora
pulled it back at the corner and scrambled in. I jumped to the top of
the fence and helped Lily over, and then, graciously, I helped the
hopeless climber Ranta get up.</p><p class="standard">By the time Ranta was
over, the hornets had reached us, so there was no time to think. We
dove into the pool at the corner and pulled the cover up over us,
waiting for the buzzing to stop.</p><p class="standard">It was hot, dark, and
wet underneath that cover, and all the light that came through it was
blue. We'd ended up at the deep end of the pool, so we had to tread
water in our clothes while we waited for the buzzing to go away.
(None of us thought of moving to the shallow end.)</p><p class="standard">Eventually, the
buzzing stopped, and we all came up. I was totally miserable, and I
just wanted to shake off my hair, squeeze out my clothes, and go curl
up on my bed for a while.</p><p class="standard">"Where's Nora?"
Lily asked.</p><p class="standard">I looked around. She
wasn't there.</p><p class="standard">A sputtering noise
came from the pool.</p><p class="standard">Before I could even
think about going back in, Ranta had done a cannonball to the exposed
corner of the pool. Lily pulled back the cover and exposed Ranta,
holding on to a coughing and spluttering Nora and keeping her head
above water.</p><p class="standard">Lily and I helped pull
them out of the pool. Lily found a chair to put Nora on while I
stared Ranta down, trying to think of something to say about how
stupid she looked right now, her clothes all soaked and trails of
water dripping from her hair.</p><p class="standard">I finally gave up. I
probably looked twice as stupid, with my soaking wet tail hanging
down like a drowned rat and my ears pinned back to my head with the
weight of the water.</p><p class="standard">Besides, she was the
one who had saved Nora, both from the bees and from drowning. Even
though Nora was annoying, I didn't want her to drown or get stung by
hornets, and Ranta was the one who had kept her safe.</p><p class="standard">"I believe in
giving credit to people when they do something good," I said. I
reached up to take off my glasses, but they weren't there. I saw them
floating in the pool. That must be why my vision was so blurry; I had
thought I just had water in my eyes. Instead I grabbed my tail and
started to squeeze water out of it.</p><p class="standard">"Like I said,"
I went on, "I believe in giving credit to people when they
deserve it. So I have to give you credit, Ranta. You did a good job."</p><p class="standard">"That's very big
of you, Cora," said Ranta. "Thank you for saying so. But
you did well too."</p><p class="standard">We stood there for a
second, not quite knowing what to say. I didn't think I had ever said
anything nice to Ranta, and I knew she had never said anything nice
to me, so this was pretty weird.</p><p class="standard">"B-by the way,"
I added, "I got a thirty-eight on my last test."</p><p class="standard">"Oh, r-really.
How nice," said Ranta.</p><p class="standard">"Ah-ha! I can
tell from how you said that that you did worse than me! How bad was
it? A twenty? A fifteen?"</p><p class="standard">"Twelve,"
Ranta admitted.</p><p class="standard">I knew I was better
than her.</p>

      <div class="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard">After
the time when Cora almost got us all stung to death by hornets
because she tried to cheat in a soccer match with Ranta, Lily invited
Ranta to join our club, but Ranta turned us down. She said she
couldn't join full time, but we could ask her if we ever needed an
extra pair of hands for anything.</p><p class="standard">Soon
after that, when I was helping Lily out in the garden, I asked her
why she had agreed to help Ms. Rutherford clear out the PE shed. "Um,
I'm not complaining," I said. "I still want to be in the
club with you. It's just, I thought...I thought we were going to be
doing things that were a little bigger."</p><p class="standard">Lily
smiled. "I didn't start this club to do small jobs like that,
but to do bigger jobs, we first have to show everyone they can trust
us with small jobs. That's why I agreed to help Ms. Rutherford."</p><p class="standard">"But
Cora might quit."</p><p class="standard">"That's
up to her. We could use her help, but if she doesn't want to do jobs
like that, she doesn't have to be a member. And you, Nora: you don't
have to push yourself for my sake."</p><p class="standard">I
shook my head. "No, I'm all right. I don't mind doing whatever I
can to help, since I don't have any gift yet."</p><p class="standard">Even
though Lily said I didn't have to push myself for her sake, she was
so nice that it made me want to push myself for her sake. That's why
I did what I did a few days after that when I was in the clubroom
alone.</p><p class="standard">Lily
is always in the garden after school, and she loses track of time
when she's in the garden, so it usually takes her a while to get to
the club. On the rare days that she attends her classes, she has to
walk over from the middle school building. Cora doesn't always come,
but when she does, she usually has to say goodbye to all her friends
in class (which is most of the class) and then pack up all her things
and drop them off in her room, change her clothes, and come over. I
bring my school supplies to the clubroom with me and don't change my
clothes, so I'm always here first.</p><p class="standard">When
no one else is here, I like to take the book I'm reading and climb
into the window seat and bask in the sunlight, like a lizard, while I
read. Today I was reading "The Faerie Queene", by Edmund
Spencer, which Ranta had recommended to me. It was really good so
far, although Spencer used a lot of weird spellings.</p><p class="standard">I
let the sun and the words both envelop me, taking me away from the
place I was. I was so entranced that I didn't notice right away when
the door opened. Once I did notice, I thought that Lily or Cora had
come, but when I looked up, I didn't recognize the silhouette through
the curtains. </p><p class="standard">"Hello?
Anyone here?" a voice called. "Come out, those curtains
aren't hiding you."</p><p class="standard">I
opened the curtains and saw the speaker was a girl about my age,
though she was tall and looked mature, like Ranta. The white band
pinned to the arm of her blouse told me she was a member of the
student council.</p><p class="standard">"Are
you a member of Lily's Helping Hands?" the girl asked.</p><p class="standard">I
had had no idea that was the name of our club, but I nodded.</p><p class="standard">"Can
you speak?"</p><p class="standard">I
nodded, unsure why she would ask me that.</p><p class="standard">"Will
you say something right now?" she asked, talking very slowly and
loudly.</p><p class="standard">"Um,
what sort of thing do you want me to say?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"That's
good enough. Now, my name is Jane and I'm the Student Council General
Affairs officer. I've come to ask this club for help. They tell me
that's what this club does."</p><p class="standard">"Yes,
we help people in need. What do you need help with?"</p><p class="standard">"Come
with me." Jane took me by the arm and marched me out the door,
down towards the grounds.</p><p class="standard"><br /></p><p class="standard">The
elementary school building was actually a complex of three buildings,
connected by a large courtyard with roofed paths to keep the rain off
when it was wet outside. The main building housed the dining hall,
kitchens, classrooms, and offices, including the lounge that Lily had
made into our clubroom. The dormitory building held the rooms for
both the students and the teachers, who lived on the top floor, and
also the laundry room and the common rooms, where we could watch
television, study, read, or chat. The library building held the
elementary school library and also the shop, where we could buy
school supplies and snacks.</p><p class="standard">The
courtyard had all sorts of little nooks and crannies where animals
and homesick kids could hide. I'm proud to say that I was never
homesick enough to hide from the teachers in the courtyard, but some
kids were, and I could understand why. A stray dog had made itself a
home in the alley behind the kitchens, and the student council was
afraid that it might attack someone if they left it there, so they
had passed a motion to have the dog removed. As general affairs
officer, it fell to Jane to figure out exactly how to remove it, and
she had turned to Lily's club to get it done. </p><p class="standard">"Um,
I'll try," I said as Jane brought me to where the dog was, "but
dogs don't like me very much, so..."</p><p class="standard">"That
won't be a problem. We used student council funds to buy this collar,
muzzle, and leash," said Jane, taking them out of her satchel
and giving them to me. "Put them on the dog and lead him out.
Then get him outside the gates and lock him out. That should be good
enough. We'll suggest building a fence across the alley to the
teachers at the next general meeting."</p><p class="standard">I
took the collar, muzzle, and leash. They were red nylon and didn't
look like anything special. I didn't think I'd be able to get them on
the dog, but I decided to try, for Lily's sake. If I could do a small
job like this, it would prove to the people that our club was ready
to take on big jobs.</p><p class="standard">"Here
we are," said Jane. "This is where I leave you. I'll be
waiting at the gates to shut them behind the dog."</p><p class="standard">Now
that I was here, it was kind of scary. The alley behind the kitchen
was dark, even though the sun was high in the sky, and it was big,
too. I was sure the dog had chosen to live here because of all the
nice food scraps, and he might be mad at me for trying to take him
away from there. Still, I had to do my best.</p><p class="standard">I
sidled up to the mouth of the alley, and then I heard a low growling
noise from the darkness. It sounded like the growling of a big, angry
bear protecting its cubs. My heart started beating faster, and I
backed away from the mouth of the alley.</p><p class="standard">I
knew that I needed to finish this job for Lily's sake, and so I
worked up my courage and tiptoed up to the mouth of the alley again.
The growling started again, and once again I backed away.</p><p class="standard">The
only way I was ever going to get past the mouth of that alley, I
decided, was if I just charged in. So I took a few deep breaths,
worked up my courage again, and ran for the mouth of the alley.</p><p class="standard">Suddenly
the dog started barking, a deep, rough, scary bark like a huge
mastiff, and I skidded to a stop and turned around and ran away from
the mouth of the alley.</p><p class="standard">"What
are you doing?" Cora asked as she came up. She must have been on
the way from her room to the clubroom; she had changed out of her
jeans and T-shirt into her nice skirt and blouse, her tail swishing
around under the pleats.</p><p class="standard">"Oh,
Cora. I'm trying to get this leash on that dog," I said,
pointing into the alley.</p><p class="standard">"Why?"</p><p class="standard">The
student council asked me to, as a member of the club. But, for some
reason, dogs have never liked me. They growl and bark at me whenever
I come up to them."</p><p class="standard">"Maybe
they can sense that you're filled with yummy cream, and they'd like
to chomp you open and lick it out," said Cora. She took the
leash and walked into the alley. I couldn't see what was happening,
but I could hear whining and licking, and the next second Cora came
out of the alley with a Basset hound on a leash.</p><p class="standard">"He's
nothing," said Cora, petting the dog's head and jiggling his
long, wrinkly face. "Just a big softie."</p><p class="standard">That's
what she said, but when that dog saw me, he started growling again,
and baring his teeth at me, until I backed away. </p><p class="standard">"Um,
do you like dogs?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"No,
I hate them. Obviously. I'm a cat."</p><p class="standard">The
dog obviously didn't feel the same way. He followed Cora obediently
as she began to lead him towards the gates. I went after them at a
distance of about ten feet, which was how far away I had to be so the
dog wouldn't growl and snarl.</p><p class="standard">We
came to the gates of the elementary school and found Jane waiting for
us, and Lily. "So this is the dog who's been chasing off the
people who sneak snacks in between meals," said Lily. "He
looks like someone's well-fed pet. I wonder if anyone owns him."</p><p class="standard">"Either
way, he was making a nuisance of himself, so he had to be removed,"
said Jane. </p><p class="standard">"He's
pretty tame, except when Nora's around," said Cora. "He
hates her."</p><p class="standard">We
put the dog outside the gates, and Jane shut them. He sat outside,
staring at us through the gates with his long, sad face as we left. I
felt a little bit bad about leaving him outside like that when it was
going to get dark soon, with nothing to eat and nowhere to go, but he
was a dog, so I guessed he would make it somehow.</p><p class="standard">"Very
good work. I'll make sure the student council comes to you with any
future tasks we need assistance with," said Jane, shaking
everyone's hand before she left.</p><p class="standard">"I'm
sorry I wasn't able to finish the job," I said, mostly to Lily,
although also to Cora who had come in and helped me.</p><p class="standard">"None
of us can do everything on her own," said Lily. "That's why
we all work together. Each of us has a unique gift, and when one of
us can't finish a job, it's all right to ask someone else who can."</p><p class="standard">"Yeah,
except Nora will need help on every job," said Cora.</p><p class="standard">"I
know one job that Nora can complete all on her own," said Lily.</p><p class="standard">"Oh
yeah?"</p><p class="standard">"Yes,
it's a very difficult job, but I know she can do it." Lily
turned to me, a serious look on her face. "Nora."</p><p class="standard">"Yes!"</p><p class="standard">"Anyone
who fails all the tests isn't allowed to be in a club until managing
to pass the next round of tests. So I'm giving you a job. You have to
make sure that Cora and Ranta study so that they don't fail their
next set of tests and get barred from helping the club."</p><p class="standard">"Y-yes!"</p><p class="standard">I
saw Cora scowling and cleaning her glasses on her shirt. Ranta was
one thing, but making sure Cora didn't fail was going to be a
challenge.</p><p class="standard">By
the way, we found out later that one of the teachers at the middle
school had taken the dog in as a pet, so things ended happily for
him. I was glad to hear that; even though he didn't like me, he was
so nice to Cora that he must have been a good dog at heart. In that
way, he was a lot like Cora, who didn't like me, but was so nice to
Lily that I knew she must be a good kitty at heart. Maybe that's why
the dog came to her.</p>

      <div class="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard">Tests
were coming up in the elementary school, so all the clubs were put on
suspension while everyone studied.</p><p class="standard">Since
Lily was a middle school student, her club wasn't stopped by the
elementary school. But Lily told us that if any jobs came up, she
would handle them herself so Cora, Ranta, and I had time to study. </p><p class="standard">Since
Lily had given me the job of making sure that Cora and Ranta didn't
fail all the tests, I asked them if they would meet me in the
clubroom every day after class to study. Ranta agreed, but Cora
didn't want to at first.</p><p class="standard">"I
don't need your help," she insisted when I asked her after class
one day. "I'll do better studying on my own."</p><p class="standard">"Ranta
is studying with me," I said. "She might do better than you
on the test. And Lily's going to be in the clubroom while we're
studying. She'll see you working hard so you can keep doing club
activities with her, and it'll make her think good things about you."</p><p class="standard">Cora's
cat ears flattened down against her head. "Fine, I'll come join
your group."</p><p class="standard">It's
surprisingly easy to get Cora to do what you want, once you know the
right things to say.</p><p class="standard">The
three of us studied reading, writing, spelling, grammar, history, and
science together. Ranta was good at reading, but she was terrible at
spelling, and whenever she wrote anything she would spend so much
time fixing her spelling that she forgot what she was going to write.
Since she was good at reading, she was also pretty good at history,
and she wasn't too bad at grammar or science either. </p><p class="standard">"I
just get bored when I have to sit still for too long and read big,
boring books," she admitted, "so when I try to study by
myself, I always end up reading a story or going out for a run."</p><p class="standard">"Why
don't you try going for a run before you start studying?" Lily
suggested as she served us tea and sliced melon. Lily was so nice,
she had been making tea and snacks for us every day while we studied.
She would sometimes stay in the room with us after that, but more
often she would go down to the garden for a while and come back with
fruit and nuts for us. She also grew herbs for her own herbal teas,
like the peppy mint tea she'd given me the first time we met. Her
concentration chamomile was an amazing help for studying; it let me
keep my focus for a long time, even if I was studying something
boring.</p><p class="standard">"I'd
like to go for a run before, during, and after studying," said
Cora, who was tapping a pencil on the table and glowering at the same
page of grammar exercises she'd been working on for the past two
days. Nothing seemed to help her. She would do all the questions
wrong and then get mad at me whenever I tried to explain her
mistakes, so there wasn't a lot I could do to help her. The
concentration chamomile hadn't helped her, either; since she didn't
know how to do any of the work, it didn't matter how good her
concentration was, I guessed.</p><p class="standard">"How
long have you been working on those problems? All week?" Ranta
asked. "Look, Cora, it's really quite simple. This is the
subject. This is the verb. The verb is the action word. Just go
through and circle the verbs and subjects."</p><p class="standard">Shut up!"
Cora snapped. "I know that. I just don't want to do it. And you
didn't know that either until Nora explained it to you."</p><p class="standard">"Nora
tried to explain it to you, but you yelled at her and made her hide
behind the curtains," said Ranta.</p><p class="standard">"Please
don't fight," I begged them.</p><p class="standard">"By
the way," said Lily, "I've seen you studying lots of
things, but so far I haven't seen you study any math."</p><p class="standard">My
blood ran cold at that word. I could tell by the looks on Ranta's and
Cora's faces that it was the same for them.</p><p class="standard">"Are
you all really confident about math?" Lily asked. "That's
great, I was always so bad at it." </p><p class="standard">"No,
no, it's not that we're confident," said Ranta.</p><p class="standard">"It's
more like we're too afraid to even try," said Cora.</p><p class="standard">For
once, they agreed.</p><p class="standard">"What
about you, Nora?" Lily asked. "Can you help them a bit with
their math?"</p><p class="standard">I
shook my head.</p><p class="standard">"Are
you also not very good at math?"</p><p class="standard">I
stood up, pushed in my chair, and ran straight for the curtains.</p><p class="standard"></p><p class="standard">When
I see words, I read them, and they make sense to me.</p><p class="standard">When
I see numbers, they swirl around in my head and chase each other like
a pack of angry wolves. My big sister says I'm a number fumbler.</p><p class="standard">It's
always been like that, but it got even worse when I moved up and
started doing fractions and decimals. Now, instead of each problem
having two numbers, it has four numbers, or six numbers, or ten
numbers, or a million numbers, or a zillion numbers, or...</p><p class="standard">Ah,
my head is spinning.</p><p class="standard">Whenever
Miss Hanover starts talking about math, I usually hide behind my
bangs so she doesn't notice me and I don't get called on to give the
answer. So far it's worked; I've never been called on to give an
answer in class. </p><p class="standard">"Well,
when it comes to math, I've always found the only way is to work lots
and lots of problems so you can remember how to do it long enough to
get through the test, then forget it all," said Lily. "Let
me go gather more concentration chamomile. You'll need it."</p><p class="standard">Cora
continued to struggle with the grammar problems while Ranta and I
started on some math exercises. </p><p class="standard">"Fractions
are my weakness, so I guess we should work on those first," I
said.</p><p class="standard">"Okay.
What's one fourth plus one fifth?" said Ranta.</p><p class="standard">I
wrote the two fractions down on my paper, separated by a plus sign,
and stared at them. I was at a loss. If only there were words instead
of these numbers. I tried writing it out as words&mdash;'one fourth plus
one fifth equals'&mdash;but that didn't help anything. I stared some more.</p><p class="standard">"I
can't remember," I admitted.</p><p class="standard">Ranta
starting helping me, and we came up with the answer two twentieths,
which looked wrong to me. Miss Hanover had shown us how fractions
could represent pieces of pie, and how we could check the answer on
problems like this by drawing three pies and splitting one pie into
four pieces, one into five pieces, and one into twenty pieces. If one
piece of the first pie and one piece of the second pie put together
looked as big as one piece of the third pie, the answer was right. I
did that, and saw that the pieces from the first two pies were
definitely bigger than one piece of the third pie. I told Ranta I
didn't think the answer was right.</p><p class="standard">"You're
right," said Ranta, scratching her head. "Geez! This is why
I hate math."</p><p class="standard">"You
were wrong when you multiplied them," said Cora. "Look, if
you multiply both desalinators by zero, you get one zeroth plus one
zeroth, which is two zeroths."</p><p class="standard">"I
know for sure that's wrong," said Ranta. "There's no such
thing as one zeroth, and there's definitely no such thing as two
zeroths! And it's the denominator, dumb cat, not the desalinator.
That's something that goes in a water filter."</p><p class="standard">We
fought for a while about what part was wrong, getting nowhere, until
Lily came back in with a bag of concentration chamomile. "How's
the math going?" she asked.</p><p class="standard">"Lily!
You've done this before. Show these dolts where they went wrong,"
said Cora.</p><p class="standard">Lily
came to the table and glanced over my shoulder at the paper, which
was now covered with numbers, plus signs, crossed out numbers and
plus signs, drawings of circles that represented pies, and drawings
of real pies, with whipped cream on top, which I had done while Ranta
and Cora were fighting over whether there is such a thing as one
zeroth. "Oh, fractions," she said. "I think I'd better
go back out to the garden. There's, um...something I need to do."</p><p class="standard">Lily
was no help.</p><p class="standard">"Okay,"
said Cora, sounding unexpectedly reasonable. "We're doing this
for Lily so we can keep doing club activities with her. As long as we
don't fail everything, we can keep doing club activities. Right?"</p><p class="standard">"Right,"
I said.</p><p class="standard">"So
here's the plan: just ignore math. We're going to fail it anyway, so
just ignore it. If we can pass at least one subject, we'll be allowed
to keep doing the club, so we just have to make sure there's
something we can pass."</p><p class="standard">"Is
there something you can pass?" Ranta asked.</p><p class="standard">"No."</p><p class="standard">"Then
let's work on reading," I said. "That's your worst subject
aside from math, so if you can pass that, Miss Hanover will see that
you've been working hard."</p><p class="standard">I
thought Cora was going to yell at me like she usually does, but
instead she nodded. "You're right for once, Nora. If I can pass
the reading test, then I can keep doing club activities, and I can
show Ranta that I'm better than her!"</p><p class="standard">"Not
a chance, kitty. Just go back to your litterbox and kick up some
dirt," said Ranta.</p><p class="standard">"Quit
it with the cat cracks! I'll scratch you!"</p><p class="standard">"Now,
now, please don't fight," I said, trying to calm them down.</p><p class="standard">I
thought that after a while, Cora would get mad and start yelling at
me like before, but she actually seemed to have gotten fired up to do
well in reading, because she sat quietly and read the passage, then
worked on the questions, asking me if something confused her. By the
end I felt like she really understood the passage and knew why the
answers were the right answers, and it made me feel good to think
that I had been able to help Cora get better at something.</p><p class="standard">After
a while, Lily came back, and we promised her that the fractions were
put away. She served us more tea, along with some pear slices and
cashews, and spent the rest of our study time watering the flowers
and plants inside the clubroom.</p><p class="standard"><br /></p><p class="standard">We
had our tests the next week. We had a day off on Friday, and Lily,
Ranta, and I went on camping trip, which I'll tell you all about next
time, over the long weekend. On Monday, Miss Hanover had all of our
tests graded, and gave them back to us after class. She left me and
Cora until last, and had us stay so she could talk to us.</p><p class="standard">"Nora,
Cora, the two of you had the lowest scores in the class in math,"
said Miss Hanover, "so I'm going to keep you here and tutor you
for a while to help you learn the material. Cora, you also did poorly
in everything else, so I'll be tutoring you in those areas as well."</p><p class="standard">She
gave us our score reports. I had passed everything except for math
with decent grades, but my score in math was horrible. </p><p class="standard">"Trade
you," said Cora, grabbing my report and handing me hers. It
looked like Cora had failed everything, and her math score was even
worse than mine. Then I noticed that she had actually passed reading.</p><p class="standard">"Miss
Hanover, since Cora passed one subject, she's allowed to do club
activities, right?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"Yes,"
said Miss Hanover. "Both of you are allowed to do club
activities for now. We'll do this tutoring for a while, and then I'll
give you both another test. If you pass that, we can end the
tutoring. By the way, Cora, I was pleased with your score in reading.
I can see that you worked hard to improve. If we can get your other
scores up too, you'll be doing well."</p><p class="standard">"Yes
Miss Hanover," said Cora. "Um, the truth is..." She
fidgeted with her tail and glanced around the room. "The truth
is, Nora helped me with reading. That's the only reason I passed it."</p><p class="standard">I
stared at Cora, shocked to hear her say something nice about me. Miss
Hanover noticed my mouth hanging wide open and smiled.</p><p class="standard">"Then
we'll have Nora help you with your other subjects too, and I'll help
both of you with math," she said. "I know you can do it.
Nora, you did all the word problems correctly, and those were the
ones that many of the others got wrong, so I see that you can do this
math, but maybe you don't quite realize it yet."</p><p class="standard">"I
don't think so. I must have been lucky," I said.</p><p class="standard">"You
weren't. Trust me, after a week or two, you'll be right at the level
of the other children. Both of you." Miss Hanover smiled. "Let's
get started."</p><p class="standard">Math
is so hard. It's like one of those riddles: 'When can you know
something, but not know that you know it? When it's the answer to a
math problem.'</p>

our tests only took four days to finish, we got to start our weekend
on Friday. On Monday, Cora and I were going to find out that we'd
both failed math and were going to have  to do extra tutoring with
Miss Hanover, but on Thursday afternoon we still didn't know and were
ready to just relax and have fun over the weekend.</p><p class="standard">I
got to the clubroom earlier than Lily and Cora, as usual. Most of the
time, I'm alone for about twenty minutes while I wait for them, but
today Ranta had come to visit. I found her sitting at the table
reading a book.</p><p class="standard">"Hi
Nora," she said when I came in. "How were your tests?"</p><p class="standard">"Okay,"
I said. "Math probably wasn't very good, but everything else
seemed fine. What're you reading?"</p><p class="standard">"It's
<i>In Memoriam</i>," said
Ranta.<i>"</i>Alfred Lord Tennyson wrote it for his best
friend, who died. It's sad, but really good. It makes me wish I had a
friend who would write a beautiful poem for me after I died."</p><p class="standard">Ranta
is really nice. Even though she's a sports girl like Cora, she also
likes to read, so it's fun to talk about books with her. I haven't
had that many chances to be alone with her, since we're in different
classes; sometimes we meet up in the library, but otherwise we only
see each other when Cora is around, and Cora fights with Ranta, so
it's hard to talk to her then.</p><p class="standard">"I
don't know how beautiful it would be," I said, "but I could
write a poem for you if you..." I started to get embarrassed and
looked down, hiding my face behind my bangs.</p><p class="standard">Ranta
looked surprised, but happy. "Thank you, Nora," she said.
"That's sweet of you to say, but I don't plan to die anytime
soon."</p><p class="standard">"N-no,
of course not..." I thought about hiding behind the curtains,
but I decided to make tea instead, to calm myself down. Lily always
kept some nice tea in the clubroom. I filled the self-heating kettle
and started it off.</p><p class="standard">I
had made tea, served Ranta and myself, and started reading my own
book, when Lily came in with another girl and a teacher. The teacher
was Mrs. Julian, one of the science teachers. Everyone liked her a
lot; her specialty was geology, so she taught us a lot about rocks
and minerals, though we also learned some chemistry and a little
paleontology from her. That's the study of animals and plants that
lived a long time ago, like dinosaurs; after they died, their bodies
were preserved as fossils that people can dig up and study to learn
what they were like.</p><p class="standard">"Oh,
good, Ranta, you're here," said Lily. "Maria and Mrs.
Julian came to ask us for a favor."</p><p class="standard">"Our
geology club is going on a field trip this weekend," said Mrs.
Julian. "We're going to the mountains north of the school to
look at some rock formations, and we'll be camping out."</p><p class="standard">"There
are only twelve of us in the club," said Maria, "and three
are little, so we wanted some more help carrying things and setting
up camp and cooking, and watching the little kids. So I decided to
ask Lily for help."</p><p class="standard">"You
don't have to come," said Lily, "but we could use the extra
help. I was hoping you'd come, Ranta, since you're so athletic and
level-headed. Of course, we could use your help too, Nora."</p><p class="standard">"I'm
up for it," said Ranta. "It's been a while since I went
camping."</p><p class="standard">"I'll
come too," I said.</p><p class="standard">"Good!
Thank you so much," said Maria. "We'll get everything ready
and leave tomorrow morning at nine. There's a van driving us up, so
meet at the front gates."</p><p class="standard">I
was pretty excited. I had never gone camping before, and I was going
to get some time to get to know Ranta better. Maybe if we got to know
each other well enough, Ranta would become my second friend at St.
Galgani's. I was hoping for that to happen.</p><p class="standard">Cora
came in later, and we asked her if she wanted to come, but she said
she couldn't. "My parents want me to come home this weekend,"
she said. "They're coming to pick me up tomorrow and bring me
back."</p><p class="standard">"Too
bad, I want to see Cora's parents," I said. "I've never
seen a grown-up cat person."</p><p class="standard">"They
just look like me, but bigger and older," said Cora. "There's
nothing special about them. Now, my big brother, he's the one you
want to see. You'll fall in love at first sight, I guarantee it!"</p><p class="standard">"Oh,
a big brother rivalry?" said Ranta. "I'll take that
challenge."</p><p class="standard">"Well,
if you really want to see him so much, here," said Cora, taking
her wallet from her pocket and handing it to Lily. Inside she had
pictures of her family. "These are my parents, and this is my
baby sister, and here's my big brother."</p><p class="standard">Cora's
parents looked a lot like her, especially her father. He wore glasses
and had the same orange-and-white hair and ears that she did. Her
mother was very beautiful, with a thin face and high cheekbones; her
ears and hair were grey, like a koala. Cora's baby sister, who I
guessed was about four, was like an adorable miniature copy of her,
though she didn't wear glasses and had a gap in her front teeth.</p><p class="standard">Cora's
big brother also looked a lot like her. He also wore glasses,
although he had his mother's grey hair and ears and thin face, which
made him look noble and princely. He was scowling, like Cora often
did, and his eyes were narrow and somehow angry. He was handsome,
that was for sure, but he was also kind of scary, and I wasn't
falling in love at first sight as Cora had guaranteed.</p><p class="standard">"Does
your brother go to school here?" asked Lily.</p><p class="standard">"No,
he's in medical school right now. He's smart, and he has the Gift of
Soothing, so he decided to try and become a pediatrician. He's
nothing like me," said Cora. "I'm stupid, and if I tried to
take care of kids, I'd just yell and make them cry. I really admire
him."</p><p class="standard">Ranta
made a snorting sound, and Cora turned on her. "So, you said
something about a big brother challenge? Did you just realize that my
big brother is cooler and tougher than yours? Come on, tell us what
he's doing. I can't wait to hear how he sits on a couch all day and
has grapes fed to him by servants."</p><p class="standard">"He
goes to school here," said Ranta. "He's in the high school.
In...the theater club. He makes costumes for them."</p><p class="standard">"Oh,
so Aurelio is your brother," said Lily.</p><p class="standard">"He
goes by Rel, just like I go by Ranta," said Ranta. "My full
name is Amaranta."</p><p class="standard">Cora
burst out laughing, although I thought 'Amaranta' was a nice name,
and said so.</p><p class="standard">"Thank
you, Nora," said Ranta.</p><p class="standard">"I
agree," said Cora. "It's such a nice name, that from now on
I'm going to call you Amaranta all the time."</p><p class="standard"></p><p class="standard">Cora's
parents weren't going to be there until ten or so, so she came down
to the gate to see us off.</p><p class="standard">I
had packed two pairs of jeans and two T-shirts, along with a water
bottle, some granola bars, a sewing kit, and my pillow. It had taken
me a month to get used to the pillow in my dorm room when I first
came, and I wasn't going to go back now. I also packed two books,
<i>White Fang </i>and <i>The
Jungle Book</i>,
just in case there was time for me to read.</p><p class="standard">Cora
and Ranta met me in the dining hall for breakfast. They fought all
through breakfast as usual, with Cora calling Ranta by her full name
and making fun of Ranta's brother for being a dressmaker. I was so
tired of listening to it that I left breakfast early and started down
to the front gates without them.</p><p class="standard">There
was a guard on duty at the gatehouse. I told him I was going on the
camping trip with Mrs. Julian, and he found my name on the list she
had given him and let me through the gates into the parking lot. </p><p class="standard">The
van was parked at the middle of the lot, with all the doors open and
the camping equipment sitting around it. A man who I assumed was the
driver of the van was loading everything up. Lily wasn't there yet
when I arrived, but Maria and Mrs. Julian were, along with the rest
of the club. As Maria had said, three of the members were little
kids&mdash;two second graders and a first grader&mdash;and the
others, aside from Maria herself and one other girl, were third
graders. Mrs. Julian was trying to keep the little kids in line when
I came up, but Maria saw me and waved. </p><p class="standard">"Sorry,
what was your name again?" she asked when I got to her.</p><p class="standard">"N-Nora,"
I said.</p><p class="standard">"Thank
you again for agreeing to come help us."</p><p class="standard">"It's
n-no trouble, I've n-never been camping before, so it ought to be
f-fun."</p><p class="standard">Maria
smiled and introduced me to Francine, a sixth grader with curly
blonde hair and kind of a horsey face. "Francine is the one
who's most excited about this trip," said Maria.</p><p class="standard">"The
other kids are just here to have fun," said Francine, "so
we could have just gone somewhere nearby to camp, but I really wanted
to see these rock formations. They're made from igneous rock that
dates back to the time of the dinosaurs. I thought Lily might like to
come and see the plants and trees, and we needed the extra help, so I
asked her."</p><p class="standard">"Oh,
you're the one who asked Lily," I said. "How did you meet
her?"</p><p class="standard">"Last
year, I was failing science," said Francine. "Miss Hanover
asked Lily to tutor me. Thanks to her, I found out that rocks are
interesting and decided to join this club."</p><p class="standard">I
didn't think that rocks were all that interesting, but I did think
that books were interesting, and I knew that it didn't feel good when
Cora said they were dumb and made her head hurt, so I didn't say
anything about that to Francine. "I didn't know that Lily liked
science," I said.</p><p class="standard">"Lily
is a genius at science! Of course she's good at botany, but she's
incredible at all kinds of science," said Francine. "Before
she helped me, I thought science was just boring and dumb, like math,
but Lily showed me that wasn't true."</p><p class="standard">Now
that I thought about it, there had been a few science questions in
our study sessions which had stumped me, Ranta, and Cora, and Lily
had come in and helped us. I hadn't thought about it much; she was
older than us and had already done it all when she was in sixth
grade. But then, she must have done fractions too, but she was too
afraid to even try and help us with those.</p><p class="standard">"Are
you guys talking about me?" Lily asked as she came up, wearing
her garden overalls and a big straw hat and carrying her leather
satchel and a backpack. </p><p class="standard">"Francine
was telling me how much you helped her in science, and how she would
never have known how fun it was without you," I said.</p><p class="standard">"All
I did was show you what was in front of you the whole time,"
said Lily. "They say you can lead a horse to water, but you
can't make him drink. All I did was lead you to water."</p><p class="standard">At
first I thought Lily had said something mean about Francine, but
Francine laughed and made a neighing sound, so this must have been
some joke between them. That had to be it; it was so unlike Lily, who
was always so nice to everyone, to say anything mean.</p><p class="standard">On
the other hand, there was Cora, now approaching with Ranta, whose
every word was something mean about someone. I was a little bit glad
that she wasn't coming.</p><p class="standard">Ranta
had worn jeans and a baseball jacket that was a bit too big for her,
and was carrying her belongings in a duffel bag. It made her look
somehow grown up that she was carrying a duffel bag instead of a
backpack like the rest of us. She always looked so mature compared to
me and Cora, even though she was in the same grade. "Is
everything loaded up?" she asked. </p><p class="standard">"Just
a few things left," said Maria.</p><p class="standard">Lily
and Ranta helped the driver load the rest of the equipment, and after
Cora had said her last 'Amaranta' for the day, we all got into the
van and got going. It was a huge van, with three bench-like seats,
each one able to hold four people. Mrs. Julian sat in the front with
the driver, while I was squeezed into the second seat between Ranta
and Francine, with Lily on Francine's right next to the aisle. Maria
sat in the back with the little kids to help keep them under control.</p><p class="standard">Francine
and Lily talked for a long time about the rocks and plants they were
going to see when we got to the campsite. I didn't understand a lot
of what they were saying; they both knew a lot more about science
than I did, just like Ranta and I knew more about books than most
kids our age. I listened to what they were saying for a while,
following along as best as I could, as they talked about igneous
rocks and geothermal vents and coniferous forests.</p><p class="standard">"Do
you like science too, Nora?" Francine asked when she noticed I
was listening.</p><p class="standard">"It's
not my favorite subject, but it's okay," I said. "Listening
to you and Lily talk, it makes me feel like science might be a lot
more interesting than I ever thought."</p><p class="standard">After
that, Ranta and I talked about books for a while and let Francine and
Lily continue their conversation about science. Even though the
little kids were loud, it was a peaceful trip without Cora, and I
enjoyed being able to talk to Lily and Ranta as much as I wanted.
Talking to Francine was also fun; even though she liked science and I
liked books, I felt like we were similar in a way. Most people make
me a little bit nervous when I first meet them, and I stutter a
little while talking to them, but from the very beginning, I hadn't
stuttered at all while talking to Francine.</p><p class="standard">We
arrived at Ash Mountains Park around noon, and everyone got out of
the van. Once we had unloaded the supplies and the driver had said
goodbye and driven off, the little kids ran around yelling in the
parking lot while Mrs. Julian explained to the older kids what we
were going to do. "We have to walk to the campsite from here,"
she said, "and it takes about an hour. First we'll eat lunch at
the restaurant here. I have club funds to pay for everyone, so don't
worry if you didn't bring money. Then we'll get going. Maria and I
will go first, with the younger children and Francine and Lily in the
middle. Nora and Ranta, please bring up the rear and make sure none
of the little kids leave the group." She gave us all maps of the
forest that showed the campsite where we would be staying. "Does
anyone know how to use a compass?"</p><p class="standard">"I
do," said Ranta, so Mrs. Julian gave her one.</p><p class="standard">The
restaurant was inside the visitor's complex of the park, a big wooden
building perched on the edge of a gulch. The restaurant had both
inside and outside tables; the outside tables were on a wooden deck
that overlooked a pine forest and a lake nestled deep down in the
valley. A waterfall sprayed down from the peak across from us and
came crashing down into the lake at the bottom. I was so impressed
with the view that I don't even remember what I ate. While the little
kids were finishing up, I took a pencil and notebook out of my
backpack and started trying to write a poem about the lake, something
like what William Wordsworth would write if he had been there to see
it. </p><p class="standard">It
was one o' clock by the time we finished with lunch, and everyone got
ready to set out for the campsite. Mrs. Julian and the older kids
split up the bigger equipment, like the tents and chairs and cooking
equipment, but we took some of the smaller things and put them in
little bags and satchels and gave them to the children. Then we set
out down the forest trail, Mrs. Julian and Maria at the head of a
herd of noisy kids, kept in line by Francine and Lily, with me and
Ranta at the end of the line.</p><p class="standard">The
forest was beautiful. There were pines and redwoods, their trunks as
wide as cars, stretching up to the skies like towers, as tall as any
skyscraper. The forest floor was littered with pine needles and pine
cones, but the trail was mostly clear. We passed from sunny areas
with no trees to shady areas where the sunlight all came to us
filtered through the leaves of huge trees that had been here for
hundreds of years before we were born, and would still be here
hundreds of years after we had died. I wanted to try writing a poem
about it, but we were walking, and I was carrying my backpack and a
folding chair, so I couldn't even have written and walked at the same
time. I started writing the poem down in my mind, trying to remember
exactly the words that came to me while I was there, although it
hadn't worked so well with the speech I'd wanted to make on my first
day of class.</p><p class="standard">"This
place makes me think of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow," Ranta
commented as we walked. "The forest primeval, and Hiawatha. Have
you read him, Nora?"</p><p class="standard">"Yes,"
I said, wanting to say more, but I was starting to run out of breath.
It had been a long time since I'd walked for this long, and I was
having a hard time keeping up. </p><p class="standard">"Are
you all right?" Ranta asked.</p><p class="standard">"I'm
sorry. I'm just not used to walking this much," I said.</p><p class="standard">"Don't
worry about it. Do you want to rest for a minute? We'll catch up to
the others later."</p><p class="standard">The
others were already getting pretty far ahead, but I did need a rest.
I sat down on a log at the edge of a high hill and took a few deep
breaths. "It sure is nice out here," I said. "I could
just sit in this spot forever and listen to the wind in the trees."</p><p class="standard">"We'd
better start catching up," said Ranta. "They're almost out
of sight."</p><p class="standard">I
started to stand up, but then something really unlucky happened: I
felt my foot slide on the pine needles that littered the hillside. </p><p class="standard">"I&mdash;I'm
slipping!"</p><p class="standard">Ranta
grabbed my hand, and we probably would have been all right, except
that then the dirt under the pine needles chose that moment to
collapse.</p><p class="standard">I
tumbled backwards, trying to pull myself back up by Ranta's hand,
pulling her back with me. We landed on the hillside and I felt myself
rolling downwards on my side like a ball down a slide, Ranta beside
me.</p><p class="standard"><br /></p><p class="standard">When
we finally hit the bottom, my head was spinning, and I had a few
bruises on my arms where I'd rolled over rocks, and my shirt was full
of pine needles, but I wasn't hurt. Ranta had landed nearby and also
didn't seem to be hurt.</p><p class="standard">"I,
I'm sorry!" I cried. "I'm so sorry!"</p><p class="standard">Ranta
picked herself and dusted herself. "It's, it's okay," she
said. "It was an accident."</p><p class="standard">"I'm
just sorry that I pulled you down with me," I said. "Now
we're both stuck down here." The hill was quite steep, and it
looked unstable, so I didn't think we could climb back up it. </p><p class="standard">"We
have the map and the compass. We'll find the campsite," said
Ranta. Our packs had tumbled down the hill with us&mdash;at least,
mine had, since it had been sitting next to me on the hill and had
fallen along with the pine needles and dirt, and Ranta had been
holding hers when I'd dragged her down with me&mdash;so we also had a
little food and water. And Ranta was with me, and she seemed reliable
and strong, so I wasn't very worried about getting to the campsite.</p><p class="standard"><br /></p><p class="standard">Two
hours later, we still hadn't found the campsite.</p><p class="standard">Neither
of us could make any sense of the map, which was so full of
topographical symbols and orienteering jargon that we couldn't even
begin to figure out where we were. Also, the visitor's center wasn't
on it, so we didn't have any point of reference. There was nothing on
the map that we knew except that campsite, and that wasn't any help
since that was what we were trying to find.</p><p class="standard">And
it turned out that Ranta didn't know how to use a compass after all.</p><p class="standard">"I'm
sorry," she said, sitting down and staring around us in defeat.
"My dad showed me how to use one when we went camping, but I
never actually did it, so it looks like I forgot everything he said."</p><p class="standard">"That's
all right. It's my fault for getting us into this in the first
place," I said.</p><p class="standard">"Well,
come on, let's see if we can get ourselves out of this," said
Ranta. "I don't know if we can find the campsite before dark, so
let's see if we can find any shelter for the night. Dangerous things
come out in this forest at nighttime, so if we can find a cabin or
something, that would be best."</p><p class="standard">"What
kind of dangerous things?" I asked, starting to be afraid.</p><p class="standard">"Pine
cats, mostly. They're like racoons crossed with leopards. There are
also bears, though I think the wardens drive them away from the areas
where people camp. And the coyotes are too cowardly to bother people.
So mostly pine cats, I think. But they climb, so we're not safe in
trees."</p><p class="standard">"If
Cora were here, she might be able to talk them into leaving us
alone," I said.</p><p class="standard">"More
likely they'd eat us just to shut her up," said Ranta. </p><p class="standard">We
walked for a while longer. We'd lost the trail, so it was hard to
tell one part of the forest from another. For all I knew, we were
just walking in circles. I started to wonder if I should mark the
trees just to make sure that wasn't happening, but after a while I
realized it wasn't happening, because the tree cover was getting
thicker as we moved ahead. Even though the sun was still high, the
sky got darker the further we went in the direction we were going. I
started to think of the direction ahead as the dark direction, and
the direction behind as the light direction.</p><p class="standard">I
couldn't walk anymore, so we stopped to rest for a minute, and Ranta
took out the map. "I think I know where we are!" she said
suddenly. "Look." She showed me the map. "See how the
little tree pictures are closer together here?" she said,
pointing. "I think that means the forest gets thicker. And this
light-colored ring probably means higher elevation, which makes sense
because we fell down that hill, so we're at a lower elevation now
than we were before."</p><p class="standard">"So we overshot the campsite,"
I said, pointing to it on the map. "It's over here, and we're
way over here, to the west of it."</p><p class="standard">"Yes.
I don't think we can walk all that way before night falls. I'm
starting to get pretty tired, so even if I carried you, I don't think
we could go that far." Neither of us could figure out how far it
actually was, since the map was so hard to read, but it looked pretty
far.</p><p class="standard">"What's
this?" I asked, pointing to a little house icon that was on the
map to the north of where we thought we were.</p><p class="standard">"Don't
know. It's not a campsite, since those have tents on them. But it
must be some kind of place with people, and it looks pretty close to
here, so I think we should go there and see if we can find help.
Maybe they can let us stay there for the night, or maybe they can
guide us to the campsite."</p><p class="standard">It
turned out it wasn't somewhere with people.</p><p class="standard">With
no better ideas, we made for the house icon on the map. The forest
got thicker and darker as we went, until it finally got so dark that
we could barely see the map anymore. At that point it was too late to
change our minds, so we kept making for the house.</p><p class="standard">When
we finally got there, it wasn't a house at all. </p><p class="standard">Inside
a cluster of old, twisted oaks which had twined together to form
something that looked like a roof, someone had built a temple. At
least, I decided it was a temple because I couldn't imagine what else
it could be for. The holes between the twisted trunks of the oaks had
been covered over with boards from the inside, and the leaves, along
with bushes and branches of other trees, had grown over to cover the
rest of the grove inside the cluster of oaks. An opening had remained
between the branches, like a door; it was too dark to see far inside
it. The oaks grew into the side of a hill, which enclosed the temple
at the back.</p><p class="standard">"This
is a disappointment," said Ranta. "I wonder if anyone's
here?" She walked up to the door of the temple and knocked on
one of the trunks. "Hello? Anyone here?"</p><p class="standard">There
was no answer.</p><p class="standard">"I
can't tell if it's dark because it's almost night or if these trees
are just blotting out the sun," said Ranta, starting to sound
frustrated. "What do you think, Nora? This place is probably
okay protection from pine cats. We could stay here the night. Or we
could try to make it to camp."</p><p class="standard">"I
don't like it here," I said, "but I don't know if I can
make it all the way to camp." It had taken us about thirty
minutes to walk here since discovering it on the map, and according
to the map, the campsite was about four times as far. After all, we
had spent two hours walking away from the campsite before we'd
figured out how to read the map.</p><p class="standard">"Then
let's stay the night here," said Ranta. "I have a blanket
and some trail mix in my duffel bag. What about you?"</p><p class="standard">"I
have my pillow, some water, and a few granola bars," I said. </p><p class="standard">"Then
let's stop for the night. Tomorrow we can make it to the campsite."</p><p class="standard"><br /></p><p class="standard">Both
Ranta and I had flashlights with us, so we spent some time exploring
the grove of twisted oaks where we intended to sleep that night. It
wasn't very big on the inside, but it was pretty tall&mdash;the roof
was about as high as the classroom back at the academy. There were
several large cracks in the hill at the far end, but they looked too
small for bears or pine cats to live in, so Ranta wasn't worried
about them.</p><p class="standard">"I
wonder who built it," said Ranta. "And why."</p><p class="standard">"Could
it have been druids?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"Could
be. Or Iroquois, maybe."</p><p class="standard">We
both read too much, I know, but it turned out that what had built
that grove was even more bizarre than druids or Iroquois.</p><p class="standard">As
night fell, we both drank some water and ate some granola bars and
trail mix, and built a little bed to sleep in from what we had.
Ranta's blanket wasn't big enough to wrap around both of us on top
and bottom, so we laid it out on the dry leaves, and put my pillow on
top to share. As darkness fell, we laid down together to go to sleep.</p><p class="standard">The
trees were so thick, and the temple roof so enclosing, that I
couldn't see a single star or one solitary beam of moonlight. Even
though it's hard to sleep when it's too light, it can be even harder
to sleep when it's too dark, especially if you're somewhere
unfamiliar or scary, so I laid there in the dark, opening and closing
my eyes. It was almost lighter with my eyes closed.</p><p class="standard">After
a while I felt Ranta's arms wrap around my shoulders. "Are you
cold?" I asked. It was a little chilly.</p><p class="standard">"No.
Scared," she admitted. "It's so dark..."</p><p class="standard">"Me
too," I said. "Ranta, I'm so sorry for getting you into
this."</p><p class="standard">"No, don't be," said Ranta. "When we
get out of here, we'll look back on this and laugh. It'll be a good
memory from the early days of our friendship."</p><p class="standard">"You&mdash;you
think of me as your friend? Even though you have so many other
friends who never dragged you down a hill and got you lost in the
wilderness?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"Of
course. None of my other friends has ever gotten me into anything
this exciting," said Ranta. "Just don't tell Cora I said I
was scared."</p><p class="standard">"Okay.
I'll make sure she never knows," I promised.</p><p class="standard">At
that moment, I heard something shuffle across leaves in the darkness.</p><p class="standard">I
heard something clicking.</p><p class="standard">"Ranta...something's
here."</p><p class="standard">"Don't
make fun of me. I didn't think you were like that, Nora," said
Ranta.</p><p class="standard">"I'm
not...something's really here."</p><p class="standard">Eyes
were staring at us from the darkness. Glowing red eyes.</p><p class="standard">Eight
glowing red eyes.</p><p class="standard">I
screamed.</p><p class="standard">Ranta
grabbed me and pulled me up, dragging me through the door of the
temple to the outside. "What is it?!" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"I
don't know."</p><p class="standard">Outside,
the tiniest amount of moonlight was managing to make it through the
trees. The thing came to the door of the temple, and I could just
barely make out the outline of something huge and hairy, something
black, something the size of a small horse, with eight legs and eight
eyes and long fangs.</p><p class="standard">It
was a giant spider.</p><p class="standard">I
was about to scream again, but I managed to stop myself. "Hide,"
Ranta whispered roughly. "Go off into the forest and hide. Once
the spiders are gone, start making for the campsite"</p><p class="standard">"What
about you?" I whispered back.</p><p class="standard">"I'll
distract it."</p><p class="standard">Just
as she said that, a second spider appeared in the doorway of the
temple, its huge fangs, like a pair of kitchen knives, clicking
together murderously.</p><p class="standard">"Go!"
said Ranta, and I went. I ran around the side of the temple and knelt
down among the branches, hoping the darkness would hide me.</p><p class="standard">Ranta
turned on the flashlight. "Hey!" she screamed, jumping up
and down and waving it above her head. "Tasty fly, over here!
Come on, spiders! Come get me!"</p><p class="standard">The
spiders went after Ranta, and she turned and ran off into the trees.
She ran, and the spiders followed, leaving me alone in the dark
forest.</p><p class="standard">I
waited as long as I dared to make sure the spiders were really gone,
and then I started off in the direction of the campsite.</p><p class="standard">Ranta's
Gift of Running meant she could run further and faster than most
people, and as far as I knew, spiders weren't famous for running, so
she should be able to shake them off and circle around to start
moving towards the campsite. I had to do my best to make sure she
didn't have to worry about me at all.</p><p class="standard">I
walked, ran, walked, ran, stopped and breathed, walked and ran, for
as long as I could before I had to stop and rest for a while. The
dark forest looked pretty much the same no matter where I went, but I
could now see a few stars through the trees, and I made sure they
kept the same shape in the sky as I moved.</p><p class="standard">I
stopped to rest in a clearing, sitting down on a log to catch my
breath, when I heard movement in the trees. I got up, preparing to
run, but then a voice called out to me.</p><p class="standard">"Ho,
I am not your enemy!" it said, and I stopped.</p><p class="standard">Through
the trees came an old man. He was stooped with age, and covered with
ragged robes, leaning on a wooden stick and pulling himself along
like a strange three-legged creature. His hair and beard were long
and white;  I couldn't see his face, as it was hidden behind a wooden
mask, which I could see was fastened to his head with leather straps.</p><p class="standard">This
must be a hermit, I decided. I had read about them in books; most of
them were old men who lived out in the desert or the forest by
themselves. The townspeople usually called them crazy, but hermits
often knew many things, and would offer their wisdom to the hero. </p><p class="standard">"Is
the bottled water good?" the hermit asked.</p><p class="standard">"Wh-what
bottled water?" I asked in response.</p><p class="standard">The
hermit pulled himself up to me, leaning on his stick, and sniffed the
air. "The bottled water is good!" he declared. "Come,
come with me to my cabin. I'll give you food and a soft bed."</p><p class="standard">"Can
you help me find the campsite?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"Campsite?"</p><p class="standard">Ranta
had the map, so I couldn't show him, but I pointed east and said,
"The campsite that way. People go there to sleep in tents."</p><p class="standard">"Yes,
yes, I'll help you get back. Come with me!"</p><p class="standard">Sometimes
hermits were dangerous, but on the whole he seemed less dangerous
than the giant spiders, and he said he could get me back to the
campsite, so I decided to go with him. That turned out to be a bad
idea, but I didn't know that at the time.</p><p class="standard">As
I followed him to the cabin, I hoped that Ranta had managed to throw
off the spiders and was coming back around to where I was.</p>
