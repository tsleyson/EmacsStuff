* Thoughts on Is the Order a Rabbit?, split into a separate file August 12th, 2014
** [Friday, July 4th, 2014] 
I still like Is the Order a Rabbit?, but it's never quite as good as I want it to be, I think because it doesn't really specialize in either humor (like Yuru Yuri) or drama (like K-On), although it does a little of both. The most recent episodes gave me some of what I wanted, though. Chino's two friends, Megu and Maya, come over. Megu becomes infatuated with Cocoa for some reason and wants to have her as an oneechan, and Maya feels the same about Lize. Chino feels lonely and goes to Ama Usa An to hang out with Chiya, who isn't very helpful and suggests that Chino just come live with her. 

There was also a cute plotline where Chino is mad at Cocoa and starts acting coldly towards her (even more than usual). Lize points this out, because Cocoa doesn't even notice any difference from usual. It turns out that Chino is mad because she was putting together a jigsaw puzzle at breakfast, and when she left to use the restroom, she came back and found that Cocoa had finished the whole thing. (Chino seems to like puzzles and models and things; in another episode, she wants to spend her day off finishing her ship in a bottle, but Cocoa forces her to go on a walk together.) To apologize, Cocoa goes out and buys a new puzzle, but it has 8000 pieces and it's too huge, so Chiya, Sharo, and Lize spend the night to help build it. 

One plotline was almost what I wanted, but at the end they swerved from dramatic to comedic and I didn't really like the outcome. Cocoa comes to school and sees that Chiya has a tear in her tights. She's going to either cover it with a bandaid or color Chiya's skin black, but Chiya just takes them off. At lunch, Chiya seems depressed and hardly eats anything, even though Cocoa offers her chestnut candy. At home, Chino is also worried about the fact that she doesn't seem to be growing anymore. Cocoa and Lize both offer to hear her out, but she rejects them both and talks to Tippy. (Earlier, when Megu and Maya asked who Chino respects more between Lize and Cocoa, Chino said neither; she respects Sharo. It's obvious why Chino doesn't respect Cocoa, but I liked that she also doesn't see the appeal of Lize.)

After work, Cocoa goes to Ama Usa An to see Chiya and finds Sharo sitting on the doorstep; Sharo explains that she and Chiya got in a fight that morning when Chiya came to wake her. Chiya always tries to give her milk in the morning so she can grow, but Sharo doesn't want it and got mad and ran down the street away from Chiya. Cocoa says Chiya was really depressed about it and persuades Sharo to go inside and apologize. It turns out that Chiya was depressed because the chestnut candy from Rabbit House is better than Ama Usa An's, and that rather than milk, she was trying to give Sharo a pair of panties that she forgot somewhere. Unfortunately, the turn to comedy at the end wasn't that funny (even though I think Chiya is the funniest character in the show), and also I found the scene where Sharo tells Cocoa about their fight to be super cute (and Cocoa got to be big sisterly for once), so I didn't really like the way the writers defused it.

[Sunday, July 6th, 2014] Episode 8 was a little better; it was cute, and fun, and we got to see more of Chiya and Sharo. (They started spelling it 'Syaro' like in the opening, but 'Syaro' is really hard to type so I'll stick with 'Sharo'.) At the end of the last episode, the Rabbit House girls came to Ama Usa An to give Chiya some bread from their bread fair (Cocoa bakes bread, since her parents owned a bakery, but Chiya couldn't come because she had work). Sharo happens to walk out of her shack next door and reveals to the Rabbit House girls that she's poor. Although they are shocked, they certainly don't blame Sharo for anything (Chino even apologizes for pushing her own image on Sharo). But Sharo is still depressed, so she makes Chiya take her on a coffee binge around all the coffee houses in the area, since she goes insane on coffee. 

The girls go to see a movie, but everyone is tired (for various reasons) and it rains on the way, so they're all soaked. The animators get to show off their skills even more when the girls stop outside the theater to watch the clouds break and the sun shine through. The movie is called /The Barista who Became a Rabbit/, based on a novel written by local weirdo/novelist Aoyama Blue Mountain, who has spoken with Cocoa before (inspiring Cocoa to become a barista-lawyer-baker-novelist, adding to her previous ambition to be a barista-lawyer-baker). She apparently used to come to Rabbit House when she was in school and was inspired by Chino's grandfather, now apparently transformed into Tippy per his wish to transform into a rabbit. 

The girls also go into a public bathhouse, which is more Ancient Roman than Japanese. They wear bathing suits, and we get to see how stacked everyone is. (We already knew Lize was from when they showed her changing into her uniform, but Chiya is also stacked, though we never see it through her kimono, and even Cocoa is surprisingly stacked.) Chino plays chess with Tippy, and then Chiya asks if she can have a go (she's never played chess, but she's played shogi). Chiya suggests they make a bet; if Chiya wins, she gets to see what Tippy looks like soaking wet, while if Chino wins, she gets to make Cocoa call her "Oneechan". Cocoa and Tippy both start kibbitzing now that their fates are on the line, and Chiya and Chino have a hard time concentrating.

The episode ends with everyone on the balcony drinking coffee milk (except Sharo, who has fruit milk instead) and Cocoa calling Chino "Oneechan". Then we see Aoyama Blue Mountain walk into Rabbit House, intending to see Chino's grandfather once again; she is shocked when she comes in to find Chino's father instead. 

This episode had the kind of stuff I've been wanting to see (as did the library episode). Yes, the stackedness, but also the cute interactions, and the different pairings, like Chiya and Chino hanging out together, and the beautiful scenery. After all, Aria wasn't that funny, and it didn't have much in the way of drama or character arcs, but it got by on beautiful scenery and cute interactions and rode that all the way to becoming one of my favorite shows ever. I think Is the Order a Rabbit? has good intentions and competent staff, but it's kind of been hampered by lack of direction; it doesn't quite have the same charm as GA, or the same humor (and yuri) as Yuru Yuri, or the same group dynamic as K-On, not because it's incapable, but because the writers have been trying to do it all and haven't developed any one angle enough. Also, five lead characters may be a little too much. K-On and GA both did it, but they had stronger senses of direction, so they were able to pull it off. K-On sometimes stumbled, too, by leaving Mugi too much of a blank, or giving Ritsu's parts sort of a forced feeling; and GA achieved direction by often focusing  more on Kisaragi than the others, which isn't really bad, but sort of sidesteps the five-character problem. 

But right now I'm pretty into Yuru Yuri, so maybe I'm just not appreciating what Is the Order a Rabbit? is offering, in the same way I didn't appreciate what Yuru Yuri was offering when I was into Bakemonogatari and K-On. I might come back to it later and try it again.

** [Tuesday, August 12th, 2014] 
I decided to finish the series after realizing that only four episodes remain. Unfortunately, Episode 9 was kind of exactly what I was complaining about to begin with. 

It starts with a flashback showing that Chino's grandfather once met Cocoa when she was a young child and told her about his wish to become a rabbit. We also see Cocoa's oneechan, who drags her off as Chino's grandfather pets Tippy and says even though he wants to be a rabbit, he doesn't want to be like Tippy since it must be terribly hot in summer. 

Chino, Cocoa, and Rize are working at the shop. (Yes, they switched to Rize, and I figured I'd switch with them because it's easier to type. Even though her full name, Tedeza Rize, comes from /thé des Alizes/, so it should be "Lize".) Rize mentions that she's leaving early to help out the theater club. She was asked to play the part of Christine in /The Phantom of the Opera/ (which makes me think of Book Girl and the Corrupted Angel). She says it's going to be tough for her since she's not ladylike. Chino sends her over to Chiya so Chiya and Sharo can train her in ladylike behavior. Chiya takes away her model guns, puts her in a nice dress, and does her hair, and then tries to teach her to appreciate plants. Sharo comes over and, to Rize's question about how she became ladylike, says it's just something she did to survive, causing Rize to remark in horror that it's a cruel world. Aoyama Blue Mountain is also in Ama Usa An and kibbitzes the whole time. 

Meanwhile, Chino and Cocoa worry that Rize wants to quit the shop and join the theater club full time, since she seemed so happy to have been cast and so eager to help. They go over to Ama Usa An to beg her not to quit, but they don't recognize her in her cute outfit and mistake her for "Rosé", someone they once encountered on the street. (It was when Cocoa made Chino go for a walk; they passed her, coming out of a beauty salon after a clothes shopping trip,  and greeted her, but Rize, whose face was turned, pretended to be someone called "Rosé" since she was embarrassed.) In the end, it turns out the theater club did an alternate version where Christine shoots at the Phantom, and purposely cast Rize for that role.

In the next half, Aoyama Blue Mountain quits being a writer. She starts working at Rabbit House and wants to give out life advice to troubled people, just like Chino's grandfather used to do. The girls make her a booth out of cardboard which she sets up on the bar. (They also make Chiya a fortune-telling booth.) No one comes, so Chiya brings her Sharo, described as "a very troubled person". Rize feeds her a personal blend of coffee, which makes her weepy, and Sharo spills her sob story to Aoyama, who comments that it's tough being a waitress nowadays because you have to be ladylike, but also a fighter. (She said something similar earlier at Ama Usa An.) Cocoa also gives her a letter asking for advice on how to make a little sister eat vegetables, and Chino, recognizing herself in the description, writes Aoyama a letter asking how to make some girl who goes around calling herself your older sister stop trying to make you eat vegetables.

Aoyama admits that she quit writing because she wanted to have the cafe's master read her work like he used to, but he's dead now, and also she lost the special fountain pen he gave her. (Those two must have been /really/ close if he gave her a fountain pen like the one we end up seeing; those things are not cheap.) Aoyama says she lost it around the time she first met Cocoa, so Cocoa and Chino go to the park to look for it. Chino ends up finding it and tells Tippy she doesn't really know what happened with him and her grandfather, but he can stop keeping it a secret just because he's the only one Chino talks to, since Chino has friends now. Tippy goes to Aoyama and tells her he liked her book, /The Barista who Became a Rabbit/, but complains that the son had a bigger part than the Master. Then we see Aoyama back to writing, as she gives a copy of her new book, /Coffee Fighter/, to Sharo, upon whom it was presumably based.

There were many cute parts to this episode that I liked, but there was so much wasted potential. Even though Cocoa and Chiya are supposed to be the crazy characters, the one who usually ends up having to carry all the scenes is Sharo. She usually has to get whacked out on coffee one way or another and energize everything. Chiya is all kinds of weird, but she never gets to let it rip and chew the scenery like you'd expect. (She's my favorite, by the way. I like her combination of yamato nadeshiko, total weirdo, and keeper of all the secrets, like knowing that Sharo is really poor or the true identity of Rosé. She reminds me a little bit of Tsukihi-chan, but with a dash of Mugi-chan and a pinch of Toshinou Kyouko.) We totally missed out by not having her direct Rize to do all sorts of weird things in the name of learning to be ladylike. (I detect some adaptation decay here, though.) We also missed out quite a bit with Sharo and Rize in that scene. The whole scenario was just basically wasted. That seems to be the whole thing with this series that's been bugging me all this time—everything about it is set up right, but the setup never leads to anything. It's like a bunch of dominos that never get pushed over.

We've got our two serious characters, Chino and Rize, ready to make sarcastic comments and shoot down lame ideas, but our crazy characters, Cocoa and Chiya, are just not delivering, and they end up leaving all the work to poor Sharo, who already works so hard to support herself and do well in school. (Sharo, like Mugi-chan, is a transition form betwen serious and crazy character; unlike Mugi-chan, who caucuses with the crazy characters, Sharo caucuses with the serious characters. Rize is a serious character with crazy moments, like GA's Kisaragi.) All Chiya did was make Rize change clothes, and it wasn't even into a crazy outfit like a bunny girl costume or a bathing suit or even a kimono (although she did wear Ama Usa An's uniform in an earlier episode when she was saving up to replace the bottle of her father's wine that she broke). Then Aoyama kibbitzed, but she didn't suggest anything crazy, she just said some kind of sensible stuff. Then Sharo arrived, and screamed as she was mauled by Anko (whose weirdness shows what Chiya must be like when she's off-camera, that we're not seeing), but then only got to say one thing, then Aoyama kibbitzed some more, then Chino and Cocoa showed up, and the scene was over. It was just such a waste.

The writers made better of the scene where Aoyama accepts life advice, but still not enough. After all, look at Aoyama. She's like, twenty years old, and a ditzy weirdo who wanders around town living a dream life of writing in her favorite cafes and having her work made into major motion pictures. What does she know about life? The writers should have exploited that. Maybe she totally can't identify with Sharo's problems because she just coasted through high school and then became a writer. Maybe she has some crazy suggestion to make Chino eat her vegetables. I know it's hard, but dammit! That's why I pay you guys!

Anyway, I still totally love the characters and art and setting, but there's just so much wasted potential, it drives me crazy. And given how good the art and setting is, if the writers couldn't do humor, I wish they would have gone the Ariadic path and focused on little daily pleasures, which they did a tiny bit in the first few episodes and in the movie and bath scenes. 

But the characters are so damned adorable! The art is so damned amazing! I really like the opening and ending too! Argh!! So many wasted chances! We never heard about Cocoa being the Rain Main with regards to math and physics again; that could have gone somewhere. Chiya never tortured Sharo nearly as much as she could have, and the scene where everyone finds out Sharo is poor was over way too quickly. Where's our scene of everyone accidentally making Sharo feel terrible by commenting on the gap between the way she really lives and the way they imagined it? Where's our touching scene where Chino tells Sharo she admires her even more now that she knows how hard Sharo works for everything she has? I don't know if the manga was like this, but I feel that the anime writers tried to cram too much into an episode. And if the manga was like this, here was their chance to improve on it, which they did not take, to my lasting sorrow, because I love these characters and this setting and I would have loved to see them expanded on the way the Yuru Yuri anime did.

But! It could still come through. Maybe the last few episodes will blossom and give me what I want. Probably not, but I can hope. 

Since I do love these characters, there follows a ranking list.

** Ranking List
*** Ujimatsu Chiya 
Like I said, she's got this yamato nadeshiko-ditz-large ham-mature adult thing going on that I dig, daddy-o. She looks super cute in her kimono, and super hot in her bathing suit. And she's the cause of most of Sharo's problems (at least, the immediate ones that don't come from being poor). After she and Sharo failed to make Rize ladylike, Chiya said they sent Rize to the wrong person. That's not really true, because Chiya is very ladylike, at least when it comes to her appearance, fashion sense, and mannerisms, which is part of what makes her weirdness fun. (Or maybe she meant Sharo. She might have a point, in that case.) 
*** Kirima Sharo
I often like frantic flailer girls—they're so cute when they flail! Sharo is a lot of fun, and has the most fleshed-out backstory of any of the girls in this show. Her backstory would be pretty good even in a show with a plot, let alone a slice-of-life moe yon-koma. The way she developed her crush on Rize was probably one of the funniest jokes in the series so far (being surrounded by a gang of rabbits and being "rescued" in a way that literally anyone in the world except her could have done). Her coffee drunkenness is pretty funny too, although I think the writers relied on her too much. I loved it when Chiya brought her to get life advice from Aoyama and described her as "a very troubled person". 
*** Kafu Chino
It's cute how smart, calm, and deadpan Chino is. She reminds me of Henneko's Tsutsukakushi Tsukiko, but with a love for puzzles and models and other tiny things you do with your hands. Her tsun-tsun behavior towards Cocoa is pretty cute too. (I guess she's more of a kuudere, so kuu-kuu behavior.) I like how more than Chino being distant, it's that Cocoa is getting too close and Chino is being normal.
*** Tedeza Rize
Like Sharo, Rize is someone who everyone has the wrong idea about. Her bizarre love of guns and tanks and her combat abilities make people think she's butch, but she actually loves clothes and makeup. I can't think of what else to say, and that's just because the writers failed you, Rize-chan. It's not your fault.
*** Hoto Cocoa
Don't get me wrong, I like Cocoa, but she was possibly the most wasted character in the show. (Maybe not quite as much as Chiya.) Her best moments were all early in the series: when she makes latté art, when she turns out to be an idiot-savant at math and physics, and when she thought Chino had read /Crime and Punishment/.  
** [Friday, August 15th, 2014]
Last time I expressed some doubt about the idea that the last few episodes would blossom and give me what I wanted out of the show as far as not wasting opportunities. Fortunately, at least as regards Episode 10, I was wrong. Episode 10 is a rapid-fire series of punchlines and little scenes that totally work at whatever they were trying to achieve, whether it's humor, cuteness and charm, or emotion. I'm not just throwing "rapid-fire" in as a filler word; the scenes are very short and quick, but every one of them works. A couple of the jokes are quite funny, and every one at least reaches the league of GA or K-On's jokes, starting with the very first scene, when Cocoa sits down at Ama Usa An and has a dessert with some flamboyant name involving warriors on a mountain. She remarks that the flavor is missing something, and Chiya says she thought so too, and you have to look the part; she puts on a giant samurai helmet that says "Rabbit" for some reason. (I guess it's the ancestral samurai helmet of Ama *Usa* An.)

Cocoa and Chiya are having an exam, so Cocoa goes to spend the night at Chiya's and study, while Rize and Chino stay behind and host Chino's friends Maya and Megu. After freakishly in-tandem working at Ama Usa An followed by dancing for some reason, Cocoa and Chiya begin studying, and call Sharo to hit them with a paper fan whenever their attention starts to wander. (Unfortunately, Chiya folded the paper fan from one of their worksheets.) Maya and Megu work at Rabbit House, with Maya borrowing Cocoa's uniform and Megu borrowing Rize's like before. (Rize changes into a bartender uniform.) They all put their hair in twin tails like Rize (even Chino, and she looks ridiculously adorable). Rize suggests they should call themselves the Chimame-Tai since they're all short (/chimame/ means "little bean", which seems to be some kind of common name for short people like what Azuki Azusa's friends called her in Henneko. Except they said /komame/. But Rize says /chimame/ because it's the first syllable of each member's name—Chino, Maya, and Megu). While working, Chino spaces out and makes fifty cups of milk cocoa, and Rize suggests that she's "Cocoa-sick". Chino tells Rize that Maya and Megu can communicate telepathically; to prove it, Maya reads in Megu's mind that Megu wants to go to the bathhouse since she heard from Chino how fun it was. 

Meanwhile, Sharo helps Chiya and Cocoa study. They first study English; Cocoa can't even read English well (she pronounces "more" like "mo-reh"), but after Sharo explains it, she and Chiya somehow become great at English and pronounce everything well. When Sharo tells Cocoa she did a quadratic equation wrong, Cocoa gets defensive and challenges Sharo to a contest of naming prime numbers. She reaches the 9600s before she gets sights an album on Chiya's shelf and gets distracted. Cocoa looks at a picture of the two of them just before high school started (Sharo had longer hair) and Sharo says Chiya was worried for their friendship since their schools are so far apart. While Cocoa and Sharo are in the bath together, Sharo realizes this might be her chance to tell embarrassing stories about Chiya's past, so she tries to tell Cocoa that Chiya is lonely and ask Cocoa to be good friends with her from now on, but Cocoa doesn't hear, and Sharo can't repeat such an embarrassing thing. 

Rize, Chino, Maya, and Megu go to the bath house. Chino expresses some worry to Tippy over whether she'll be able to be a good hostess for her friends. Before Tippy can respond, Aoyama Blue Mountain butts in and says she thinks the master would tell her to be herself. Rize buys water guns, and they have a water gun fight. Since Maya and Megu have telepathy, Rize tells Chino to let her take the lead, so Chino hides behind a pillar with Tippy, who hates getting wet. Aoyama finds them and Chino tells her what's going on, but it turns out that Aoyama was enlisted by Maya to find them and takes Tippy hostage. Rize shoots Aoyama and Tippy, then Maya, and then ferrets out Megu quickly. 

After the bath, Rize goes home and Chino tries to figure out what she can do with her friends at home. The only game she has is chess, but her father brings in some kind of rabbit mobster-themed game for them. Meanwhile, Chino agonizes over texting Cocoa, who she manages to admit to herself that she misses. Of course, she doesn't want Cocoa to know it. She settles for texting Chiya a picture of them at the bathhouse, just after Tippy was shot, since Chiya wanted to see Tippy wet. Cocoa, Chiya, and Sharo talk about Chiya and Sharo's childhood friendship and how nice it is, but Chiya assures Cocoa they have lots of time to be together and make new memories, and Cocoa asks if that means she has to have straight bangs. (Which Chiya and Sharo both do.)  Cocoa thinks the middle school girls are having fun without her and that Chino isn't missing her at all, but Chino sneaks out into the hall and agonizes over whether to call her. Before she can make up her mind, Cocoa calls her, and Chino admits that living with Cocoa has made her more comfortable around people and enabled her to have fun with her friends that day. Cocoa, Chiya, and Sharo cut Cocoa's bangs and send out the picture, but it goes to Rize, who wonders why they sent it to her and thinks the straight-banged look is some kind of new style. She decides to try it out herself. 

Before Cocoa came to Chiya's, she tried to borrow Tippy, since she has to cuddle him to get to sleep. Obviously Chino wouldn't oblige, so now that Cocoa is trying to get to sleep, she brings Anko into the room to cuddle. Sharo freaks out, telling her not to bring that thing into the room. Chiya suggests that Cocoa cuddle Sharo instead, and Sharo, in her panic, agrees that Cocoa should cuddle her instead. Cocoa says Sharo sure is confident in her cuddliness. Sharo has a weird dream where she's at school with Cocoa and Chiya and they're going off to the cafeteria to buy bread, but Sharo doesn't have any money. She wakes up and hears Cocoa sleep-talking that she'll give Sharo her melon bread, and Chiya sleep-talking that if they don't get there soon, all the bread will be gone, and realizes they're all having the same dream. (Speaking of telepathy.) She tries to get back to sleep so she can finish it with them. 

The next morning, Rize goes to Rabbit House for work, wondering if Chino, Maya, and Megu are actually working. When she comes in, the three greet her with "Welcome home, Oneechan!" and Megu says they wanted to trying doing a little sister cafe. Rize says that would only work on Cocoa and commands the Chimame-Tai to attention.

This was probably the best episode since Episode 3. The friendship theme was really cute and led to lots of cute and charming moments. The tenor was more Aria/GA than Yuru Yuri, which is probably part of the reason for its success. It felt like the series found its feet a little more here instead of flailing around without direction like in previous episodes. I kind of wonder if this was all one chapter in the manga, or two closely linked chapters, and if the middle episodes were composites made from unrelated chapters that couldn't be integrated as well due to length and unrelatedness of the content. 

This was also the first time since Episode 3 that I felt every character pulled her weight. Even though we had the extras Maya, Megu, and Aoyama, it actually didn't feel crowded, even though in previous episodes it sometimes felt crowded with just the main five because some of them (principally Rize and Cocoa) just didn't seem to be doing anything. I do wish we'd gotten to hear a little more about Chiya's past, but that was pretty much my only regret here. Since Chiya and Sharo are my first and second-favorites, I really liked their scenes with Cocoa (especially when Chiya said that Cocoa should cuddle Sharo—though I kind of wish it had actually happened, even if just for a moment, like when Cocoa tried to load up on cuddles with Tippy and Chino at the beginning). But Chino's arc was really cute. And I liked seeing how well Rize got along with the younger girls, with her combination of serious guidance and fun. 

At some point I might go back and re-watch this series all at once, and see if I can spot something in the earlier episodes that I didn't see. I didn't appreciate GA all that much when I first read it (and I have to say, even now I find Volume 1 pretty weak), but once I realized that it was a cute and charming art manga and stopped expecting it to be Lucky Star or Love Hina, I came to appreciate it. Although I don't think I need to totally change my view about Gochiusa, it might be helpful to go back and watch earlier episodes after seeing the tenor the show finally sets, so I can view them in light of that. Like I said, I love the characters and the setting and the art. I'm glad Episode 10 came along.
** [Tuesday, September 2nd, 2014]
Episodes 11 and 12 went more for the cute and peaceful than the funny, and they work, more or less, although they're not as good as Episode 10. Episode 11 is the Christmas episode. The girls go to an outdoor market to buy presents and shop for their Christmas party. Later, they try to hold the party at Rabbit House, but the customers don't clear out as quickly as they'd like. When Sharo jumps in to help, Maya, Megu, and Chiya end up doing the same. When the kitchen runs out of butter, Chiya tries to make her own. Afterwards, they have a party, and then Cocoa and Chino's father leave presents for Chino on her pillow "from Santa", although Chino tells Rize it was a very clumsy Santa. Episode 11 was somewhat ruined by technical difficulties, but it showed off the art really well and had a sweet storyline. 

In Episode 12, Chino wakes up one morning and finds Cocoa sleeping next to her. She asks why, and Cocoa says it's because Chino wouldn't let go of her arm last night and speculates that it's because the smell of the bread they baked together is still hanging on her. Cocoa ends up running into Chiya, Rize, and Sharo while on a simple errand and stretching the errand out. Pursuant to her conversation about the bread smell with Chino that morning, they discuss how everyone smells. Cocoa says Chiya smells like wabi-sabi (?); Chiya says Sharo smells like the herbs in the herbal tea, and Cocoa jokes that Rize smells like gunpowder. Later, Maya and Megu come by to interview someone for their school project. Chino gets them an interview with her father, and then has Cocoa take them to Ama Usa An to interview Chiya, and to Fleur de Lapin to interview Sharo. They also run into Aoyama, who turns out to be a pervert who likes looking up the skirts of the girls at Fleur de Lapin.

Cocoa comes down with a cold after this, so Chino takes care of her. The cold medicine runs out and Chino goes to Chiya's to borrow some. Meanwhile, Aoyama comes up from the bar with some hot wine for Cocoa, but Cocoa is asleep, so she drinks it herself and somehow gets rather drunk. Chino admits to Tippy on her way over that she doesn't hate Cocoa's scent. Since Sharo is also sick, Chiya has tons of medicine, so she gives Chino a box and sends her back.

After Cocoa gets better, Chino ends up getting mumps somehow (don't they have vaccines for that sort of thing?). After Chino gets better, she goes in to wake up Cocoa, who isn't getting up. To make Cocoa get out of bed, Chino calls her "Oneechan", which wakes her right up.

I liked these two episodes, although they weren't quite as good as Episode 10 and also didn't quite elevate my opinion of the series. The humor was once again pretty shoddy after being pretty good in Episode 10. There were a few good jokes in Episode 11, like when Chiya tried to make butter or when Sharo was touched that she wouldn't have to spend Christmas alone in her shack again. It was also pretty cute when poor Sharo was stuck outside in the snow handing out flyers for Fleur de Lapin in her short skirt. Episode 12 had too many jokes where someone (Cocoa at one point, Rize at another) would say something absurd, and someone else would buy it, but the writers didn't know how to continue the scene so they'd just have the joker say "It was a joke" and cut off. Also, even though I thought Chino and her relationship with Cocoa was cute, it wasn't really developed well enough to have the bang we needed for a finale. It had a beginning and an end, but no middle. Contrast that with Azusa's relationship with Yui (and the sempai-tachi in general) in K-On. It had a beginning—Azusa being annoyed with their lazy ways; it had a middle—Azusa slowly coming to respect them as musicians and friends, to realize she cares about them, and to acknowledge that she has a ton of fun playing music with them; and an end—the graduation, and Azusa crying and begging them not to leave (and the sempai writing "Tenshi ni Fureta yo!" for her in the anime). Chino and Cocoa had a beginning—Chino being annoyed at Cocoa at various times, such as when Cocoa finished her puzzle; it also had an end, in Episode 12 when Chino finally calls Cocoa "Oneechan". But it had no middle; or at least, the middle felt too much like the beginning of an end, since Episode 10 seems to be the "middle" part.

I just have to say that in the final analysis, as much as I loved the characters and art, the writing just didn't do it. I think it would be great as a franchise of character goods, like Hello Kitty or Digi Carat; everyone is super adorable and there's definitely some artistic and musical talent here. The fun, calm little French violin piece that plays towards the beginning of many scenes is fully as engrossing as the peaceful piano piece that plays at similar times in Aria, and the animators did almost as well at capturing a Central European look as the Aria team did at capturing an Italian look (minus the crazy attention to detail, of course).  But there was just too little impact, too many wasted opportunities, too little direction.

Impact is hard to define, but I'd have to call it the property of evoking some kind of emotional response. Most shows try to get at either violent impulses, anger, horror, or else sexual impulses, or the impulse to sympathize with a character, or excitement, novelty, wish fulfillment of some kind, or the urge to laugh. Aria, of course, whacks the viewer with a meteorite of peace and wonder. Gochiusa just lacks impact in so many ways. The humor usually isn't that funny and isn't even dorkishly cute like most of the K-On humor. But even though the series angles towards peace and wonder, it never quite gets there because it never emphasizes those traits. The feeling I've felt most often while watching the series is chagrin, because I so much want it to wow me, and it never does.

Opportunities get wasted all over the place. I've talked before about how much the characters are a wasted opportunity, especially Chiya. This cast should have been hilarious, or adorable, or both. Instead they're merely cute and occasionally worthy of a chuckle. Aside from Sharo, their emotions are usually more of an intellectual fact than a visceral reality; even in Sharo's case, the emotions only really achieve a visceral status because her backstory is intricate and well-developed. 

And the series seemed to struggle with finding a direction. Even though moe yonkoma are a genre where most things are set the moment you choose it, there are some things a writer needs to tune. What's the comedy level? What's the drama level? What's the tone? The level of realism? How much of a bubble is the world? What brings these characters together in these amorphous non-adventures? I really missed a theme here. The series has the coffee house theme, but that theme never plays a part even at the level that music does in K-On, probably because it's just a job and not something that really brings them together. (Doubly so for Rize and Sharo, but even Chino and Chiya, the daughters of cafes, seem to think of it more as a household chore than a passion, and while that's realistic and understandable, it doesn't help the series find a direction.) 

Having too many characters was sort of a problem too, because no one had as much definition as I wanted. It kind of felt like the manga-ka knew some of the major characters were a bit weak and tried to throw more characters at the problem to make it go away. It doesn't feel like Yuru Yuri, where each character was included for a purpose, defined by relationships with the other characters and importance to the theme, yuri. Lucky Star was similar in that it had a lot of characters who were kind of tangential, but Konata and Kagami were such strong characters that the series still got by. It can be hard to pull off a five-girl group; even in K-On, Mugi never got the time she needed, though the author made a valiant attempt in Volumes 3 and 4 and the anime writers made a valiant attempt to expand on her. In GA, Tomokane is pretty underdeveloped. But more than having too many characters, I guess the problem was that the way they fit together doesn't quite feel satisfying. We needed something like Mugi and Ritsu's date, or Namiko's sick day, or Azusa and Yui's performance as Yuiazu. I wanted that out of the plot where Chiya and Sharo got in a fight, but at the worst possible time the writers tried to deflect with comedy. 

I feel very conflicted about this show because I wanted so much to like and did really like certain aspects of it, but can't wholeheartedly say I like it because of how the writing turned out. Haganai showed how a new work can take a very constrained and already saturated genre and make something original and interesting, with flair, out of it; it did something new and interesting with the harem light novel genre that Haruhi Suzumiya, Bakemonogatari, and Ore Imo had already defined, while still constraining itself to work within that genre. I wanted Gochiusa to do something like that with moe yonkoma, but it didn't. And I'm very sorry for that. The show seems to have been almost totally ignored by the US fans; there's no scanlation of the manga, and the songs aren't posted anywhere. As much as I'd like to read the manga (to see if it was any better) and listen to the songs, I have to say I'm not really surprised, despite the hyperbolic statements of love I saw in forums and Crunchyroll comments (I was a little puzzled by the amount of love for Aoyama; I guess she's sort of amusing, but really she's a pretty standard sort of side character who becomes somewhat interesting because she's a writer and is voiced by Saori Hayami). It makes me sad, but that's how it is.
