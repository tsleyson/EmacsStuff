Attack on Turkeys! By Ranta.
============================
I thought my peaceful life behind the school gates would go on forever. A time of peace, a time before my rivalry with Cora, when I thought we'd be safe behind those walls: fourth grade.

My mother sent me pudding that day, her special pudding with cocoa and bananas. She made it herself. She doesn't make it very much. She's usually too busy. So even though it's based on a mix, it's special when she takes the time to make it for me. All my best memories of my mother have that pudding in them. I used to sit at the kitchen table while she made it and tell her about school and whatever books I was reading, and when she was done, she would let me lick the spoon.

But that day was the last time I ever tasted her pudding.

My mom had packed it in a foam cooler with some bags of ice and sent it by express mail. The ice had melted by the time I opened the box, but the only wetness inside was the sweat from the outside of the plastic bags. She'd included a note, telling me to put it in a refrigerator and let it cool off before I ate it. But the only refrigerator was in the snackroom, and I was afraid someone would steal it if I put it here, so I didn't follow her advice. Instead I got a spoon from the snackroom and took the pudding out to the grounds.

It was a late summer day, warm and lazy. The middle schoolers had taken a beach trip for the day, so the grounds were emptier than usual. I decided to go sit under my favorite oak tree near the playground. A group of second and third graders was playing on the jungle gym. I sat against the oak tree, the grass cool against my legs, and opened the cooler, taking out the pudding and pausing to admire how good it looked, the deep brown of dark chocolate and sweet, pale yellow chunks of banana, before I began to take off the lid.

Then I heard the screams of the second and third graders turn from joy to terror.

I looked up.

That was the first time I ever laid eyes on those monsters. Their deadly claws, their fell beaks, the grotesque, wrinkled, sagging flesh of their heads, changing color from angry red to pale pink to deep bruise-blue.

The second and third graders had scattered. Some had run, back towards the safety of the elementary school gates. Two of the monsters peeled off to follow them, their eerie squawking drowning out the shrieks as they chased down the slowest, their talons and bills shredding the fallen. Others had climbed to the top of the jungle gym, trusting in the monsters' limited flight abilities. Two more of the monsters were laying siege to the jungle gym, waiting at the bottom for their prey to come down.

The largest of the monsters was pure white, his eyes milky blue. I don't know if he truly sees with those eyes, or if he's guided by some primal bloodlust which is far more effective than mere sight when it comes to finding his victims. But he knew I was there. He left his comrades' siege and came towards me, where I sat under the tree with my spoon just about to break the surface of the pudding. At a squawk from him, the other two followed.

I was cornered. They were between me and the jungle gym, and I couldn't get around. I'd seen what happened to the ones who tried to run. In those days, I was an okay runner, but nothing special. I didn't think I could escape if I ran.

The monsters closed in around me, trapping me with my back against the tree. The white one stared at me, those milky blue eyes searching me like the scanners on the starship Enterprise. And then he squawked. It was like he could see my soul, my cowering, pathetic, quivering soul that just wanted to eat pudding in peace, and with that squawk, he was laughing at what he saw. At his squawk, the others squawked as well, as if they too were laughing at me. They craned their necks, staring at the plastic container in my hands, and squawked.

At that moment I knew that they wanted my mother's pudding.

"I'm not giving you pudding," I said.

The squawking got louder. They were laughing at me. They were laughing because I was powerless to stop them; if they wanted pudding, there was nothing I could do.

Suddenly, a rake bashed one of the monsters on the head. "Ha! Ha!" yelled its wielder. "Get back, you scum!"

It was the groundskeeper, George.

The monsters sprang at him. George dropped his rake and swung his arms in wide circles, pushing them away. They backed off, preparing to attack again. George didn't waste any time; he grabbed me in his arms. The container of pudding, wet from the ice bags, slipped from my hands and fell to the grass as he ran away with me.

"No!" I yelled. "My mother's pudding!"

"Forget it, no pudding is worth your life!" George cried as he heaved me over his shoulder and carried me away. I watched as the white one sank his bill into the pudding, squawking at the other two to keep them away when they came in for a bite.

That was the last I ever saw of my mother's pudding.

The shop went national after that, and my mother didn't have time to make it again.

<br />

Two years later. Sixth grade. I came to the clubroom one day after a run and a shower, and found only Lily and Cora were there. That was unusual; most days, Nora was here before any of us.

"Hi Ranta," Lily greeted me.

"Hi," I said to Lily as I set my bag under the table and sat down. "Where's Nora?"

"At the middle school with Miss Huckle," said Lily. She set down her watering can and went to make tea for me, but I got up to do it myself.

"Doing her science loser nerd boot camp with the sarge," said Cora, scowling. She took off her glasses and set them on the table, on top of something I'd never seen her with before.

"Is that a book?" I asked, setting down the tea kettle and turning to get a better look. "Cora, are you *reading*?"

Cora's cheeks turned red. "No—it's—I guess it kind of is. It's a graphic novel. I see Nora enjoying those books all the time, and I was b-bored, and I...Why am I explaining this to you?!"

"Oh, it's a comic book," I said.

"Don't look down on graphic novels," said Lily. "They're not 'comic books'. Graphic novels are a rich storytelling medium. The combination of story and illustrations on a printed page is different from anything else. I know you prefer regular books, Ranta, but you should try one of these sometime."

"Th-that's right!" Cora said. "Lily's right! Lily's always right!" She picked up her glasses and started wiping them on her shirt, blushing and twitching her tail.

I always kind of thought Lily didn't like Cora, but I guess they did have something in common after all. "Fine," I said. "Maybe I'll read it sometime, if it's interesting. What is it?" I was going to pick the book up and look at it, but Cora snatched it off the table before I could get there.

"It's a secret," she said.

I shrugged and went back to making tea. "So Nora's not coming at all?"

"Miss Huckle is going to keep her until dinnertime, and longer if she can," said Lily.

"Come on, really? Just dinnertime?" said Cora. "Nora can't stand up to that drill sergeant witch. She'll be there until Christmas vacation. She'll get sucked dry. When she comes back, instead of being the floofy poetry-spouting kind of nerd like she is now, she'll be one of those 'E=mc<sup>2</sup>' kind of nerds."

"She'll have to borrow your glasses so she can look the part," I said.

Cora shoved the glasses back on her face and scowled. "No one wears these except me," she said.

I finished making tea, and we'd just started to settle in, when she came. Jane, from the student council. I hadn't met her, but Nora had told me about the time with the dog. Jane had asked her to lure it out of the alley and get it off the elementary school grounds. Later, Miss Hanover had heard about this and had reported it to Mrs. Bates, the principal, who oversaw the student coucil. Students weren't supposed to be handling dangerous things like that. That dog could have turned out to be aggressive, and that would have been bad. The groundskeeper, George, was supposed to handle things like that.

Jane knocked on the door and then came in without waiting to be invited. "Good day, all," she said. "Are you Lily's Helping Hands?"

"We are," said Lily.

"And are you Lily, the president of this club?"

"I am," said Lily.

"We have a situation," said Jane. "The children are in danger. We require your assistance."

I frowned at Jane over my book. "Last time you asked this club for help, you put my friend in a dangerous spot by asking her to deal with a stray dog. Why should we help you again?"

"You must. The student council took a vote, and decided unanimously that something must be done about this situation. We then took another vote, and voted unanimously that someone other than the student council should do something about this situation."

“And what’s ‘the situation’?” Cora asked, scowling over her comic book—I mean, graphic novel. Whatever. It still has pictures, like baby’s first reader, perfect for someone like Cora, whose reading skills and tantrum-throwing were both at the level of a baby.

“Last night, a group of second and third graders was attacked on the playground,” said Jane. “The attackers trapped them on the jungle gym and waited until it was time for dinner, then chased them back to the school, pecking and kicking the whole way.”

Suddenly, I felt as if my mind had left my body. The cup of tea on the table was a thousand miles away. My arms and legs went limp, hanging and refusing to move. My jaw fell open, and I stared at the ceiling, wanting it not to be so.

“Pecking and kicking?” Lily asked.

“Yes, the attackers were a gang of rogue turkeys. One was white, with blue eyes.”

I screamed.

<br>

I finished screaming. “I can’t do it,” I said. “I won’t do it. This isn’t our job.”

“You don’t have to help,” said Lily gently. “I can take care of this alone. Just sit tight here and finish your tea.”

I stood up and began to pace back and forth. I wanted to panic just from hearing the ‘t’-word. My heart was pounding a hundred miles an hour, but I couldn’t sit still. I wanted to go run again, but I didn’t want to leave the clubroom—that was where they were.

“They’re just turkeys,” Cora scoffed. “Geez, you’re a wimpo. Who knew you were such a wuss? The great Ranta is scared of a bunch of turkeys!”

“I was given to understand they were quite large,” said Jane.

“You shut up,” Cora snarled, and Jane recoiled, looking put off. “People like you who’re too dumb and lazy to take care of things themselves don’t get to have opinions.”

“Actually, the Student Council is there to have opinions,” said Lily.

“Yes, quite,” said Jane. “And it was my opinion that, after your admirable work with the dog, you were the best for this job. Was I wrong?”

“You don’t understand,” I said. “I’ve been attacked by these turkeys before. It was when I was in fourth grade. They ate my mother.”

“They ate your mother?” Lily repeated.

“Well, her pudding that she sent me. I really wanted that pudding, and my mother hasn’t had time to make it for two years.”

“So they’re dangerous to puddings,” said Cora. “Good thing Nora’s not here, since her head’s made of pudding.”
