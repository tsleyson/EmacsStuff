##Thoughts on Episode 2, November 14th, 2013:

Episode 2 was a lot of fun. They did more with the crazy concept like I wanted. After an attack where Nyaruko chan blows up a bunch of Nightgaunts using a hand grenade with a ribbon tied on it, Mahiro asks why they don't just go to the enemy's base and blow them up. Nyaruko chan realizes that R'lyeh is rising and brings Mahiro there on the back of Dagon, which she claims is cute somehow. There's an amusement park on R'lyeh and Nyaruko chan wants to have fun, but Mahiro makes her stick to business and come with him to shut down the slave auction. Nyaruko chan says he's totally going to be a father who sacrifices his life to work. She then gives him a box that she says contains an engagement ring, but when he throws it on the ground and stomps on it she cries and says it's a device to call her to his side when he's in trouble.

They go to the slave auction and find Nodens, an old bearded alien, in charge. He makes Nyaruko fight Kuko of the Cthuga race, an old schoolmate whose race is an enemy to Nyaruko's. (Her name is Kuko, not Cthuko, because in Japanese they say "Kutuga" for Cthuga and "Kuko" for her name.) Nyaruko and Kuko go into another dimension where Nyaruko's power is halved and they fight. Kuko wins and pins Nyaruko down on a bed, telling Nyaruko that she's actually in love with her and is going to lesbian rape her. She starts stripping Nyaruko despite the latter's protests and when Nyaruko asks about the fights between their races she says her father told her some crazy thing which Nyaruko thinks sounds like something a negotiator from the city of lost memories would say. Kuko says "Ye not guilty" and Nyaruko screams "You are!" as Kuko goes to finish the rape. However, when Kuko says she's going to kill Mahiro so she can have Nyaruko to herself, Nyaruko transforms into magical armor mode and blasts Kuko. (It turns out that "space CQC" just means whatever you want it to, so anything they do in combat can be called space CQC, including Nyaruko's grenades and Kuko's lasers.)

Meanwhile, Nodens is preparing to do something terrible to Mahiro. Mahiro opens the box Nyaruko gave him and she pops out in armored Kamen Rider mode and rescues him, Nodens tells them he was planning to make Mahiro the star of a BL drama about a student who is erotically tortured by a young doctor and auction off the part of the doctor. Mahiro tells Nyaruko to blast Nodens, and she does.

Nyaruko san parts with Mahiro in a park at twilight, saying her work is done now, and Mahiro for the first time calls her Nyaruko instead of Nyarlathotep. Of course, she is at his house when he gets back and offers him a choice of "Me, me, or me" first, then says the adventure is just beginning and more enemies could appear at any time.

I really needed a laugh and Nyaruko san gave it to me. I especially like the Big O joke, which was very unexpected. The yuri scene with Nyaruko and Kuko was hot, too. This show is really fun and doesn't pretend to be anything else, which I like.

##(Half of) Episode 3, November 16th, 2013:

Due to technical problems, I could not watch the rest of episode 3. But I liked what I saw.

Nyaruko starts the morning by harassing Mahiro, trying to feed him and calling him Onii sama, then Nii Nii, then asking if he'd rather she were his older sister. She takes out Shantak kun, her Pokemon ripoff, which has now become a small bat-winged hippo creature with chicken feet. She encourages Mahiro to pet Shantak kun, which Mahiro does, and admits that it's sort of cute. Nyaruko tries to get Mahiro to pet her on the stomach too but he ignores her and leaves for school.	

At school, there's another new transfer student and of course it's Kuuko chan. She arrives calling herself Yasaka Cthuga aka Kuuko chan and claims to be Nyaruko's wife. Mahiro and Nyaruko drag her into the hall and make her tell them what's going on and Kuuko says she quit the Nodens organization and now works for the galactic defense people, having called her uncle and gotten him to give her a job. Mahiro makes her explain it in just three lines, so she tells them that some organization was destroyed by unknown villains and now those villains are headed to Earth, and adds the line "Nyaruko, let's make babies" at the end. 

Kuuko wants to use Mahiro's house as a base; at first Mahiro is against it but Kuuko tells him when they're done she'll take Nyaruko with her as her wife and Mahiro is all for it. The teacher then comes out and makes them come back into the classroom.

Kuuko bothers Nyaruko by hanging on her and talking about lesbian sex and making babies. Nyaruko unknowingly tells Kuuko the same words that Mahiro told her earlier when she was being clingy and annoying. When the school newspaper girl comes along and asks for the scoop she gets the story that Nyaruko is Mahiro's wife and Kuuko is Nyaruko's wife and somehow just buys that without any further thought. Then it cut off because the network I was on went down to almost zero signal strength.

Nyaruko has the potential to be annoying, since she's high-strung and so strong, but Mahiro is mean to her and stabs her with a fork, and Kuuko afflicts her, so that potential has yet to be realized. I like her, and I think she's one of Kana Asumi's better parts. I'm not sure who voices Kuuko (Nana Mizuki?) but I really like her voice, and she is cute and funny and runs around talking about lesbian sex and making babies with Nyaruko in a flat, toneless voice with no expression. (Given their weird biology, it might actually be possible for them to make babies somehow.) Mahiro is a decent hero too. I like that he treats all this alien monster crap with an air like he's stopped in traffic due to road work. He reminds me of one of those oblivious main characters of British comedy who gives both mundane everyday events and insane things the same reaction.

##The end of Episode 3, Episode 4, and Episode 5, December 12th, 2013:

In the second half of Episode 3, Nyaruko's older brother who's jealous of her shows up and is run over in passing at the end of the episode while Nyaruko rides her super motorcycle off (I forget why). It turns out he was causing trouble in town and Nyaruko unwittingly stopped him, for which she takes credit for doing intentionally when her superiors notify her of this.

At the very end of the episode, Kuuko moves in and Mahiro ends up having to threaten them both with the fork to make them stop fighting (all eldritch creatures fear the fork, apparently). He then receives a call from his mother telling him she's on her way and will be home in forty seconds. At the beginning of Episode 4, Mahiro freaks out, throws away the trash, throws away the alien food that Nyaruko left in the refrigerator, and throws Nyaruko and Kuuko out the door. Of course, they just come back in, and Mahiro's mother Yoriko (who is totally hot, of course) comes back to find them all rolling around on the floor in a weird chain of attempted rape.

Yoriko, who likes hugging Mahiro and says she's replenishing her "musukoniumu" (translated as "sononium") when she does it, it turns out, is a part-time hunter of eldritch creatures (the Japanese word sounds like jashin and the subs say "deity", but even though Lovecraft's creatures were sometimes worshiped as gods, they weren't really, and in the show they're just aliens, so I don't really like that word). When she realizes what Nyaruko and Kuuko are, she pulls out eight forks (four in each hand, like ninja weapons) and threatens to kill them until Mahiro explains that they're not dangerous, merely annoying (and in fact they are doing some services to the Earth at this point).  Nyaruko tries to make nice with her and starts calling her "okaasama" and asks if she'll accept her as Mahiro's wife; Yoriko says it's too early for her to accept anyone as Mahiro's wife, especially a non-human, and asks Nyaruko to wait. (Which was surprisingly sensible, although perhaps not the right answer when the girl asking is a crawling chaos.) She does say that she's willing to accept Nyaruko and Kuuko as her houseguests and will let them stay as long as they're on Earth, even though Mahiro tries to get her to kick them out.

The next morning, Kuuko and Nyaruko make Yoriko mad by fighting, so Yoriko threatens them with the fork and they run off to school ahead of Mahiro. On the way to school, Mahiro runs into a cute blonde girl (so he thinks) with a star-shaped satchel, who is looking for someone. Later, on the way home, Mahiro runs into the girl again and invites her to lunch at a fast food place. Nyaruko and Kuuko show up in the middle and see that the girl is Hasuta-kun, a member of the Hastur race and actually a boy. They attended space kindergarten together. It turns out that Hasuta-kun is on Earth looking for Yoriko at his father's request.

Mahiro brings Hasuta-kun home to meet Yoriko, who is delighted with him. Kuuko tries to convince Hasuta to shack up with  Mahiro so she can have Nyaruko to herself; Mahiro isn't into this but Hasuta actually is. Suddenly, a green-haired woman with big breasts appears and grabs Yoriko, telling them that whoever has Yoriko might hold the key to ruling space. She whispers something in Yoriko's ear that gets her to come quietly; when Nyaruko and Kuuko try to fight her, she does the same to Kuuko, who fends off Nyaruko, makes a big flame wall around the house, and lets the three of them escape in a DeLorean.

Hasuta uses his wind powers to get rid of the wall of flame, and Mahiro praises him and pats him on the head. Nyaruko asks if she didn't do her best too, and Mahiro grudgingly pats her on the head as well. They go inside and Nyaruko calls her boss, who traces Kuuko to R'lyeh, which has now sunk to the bottom of the ocean and is only accessible to members of the Cthulu Corporation. They speculate on why Yoriko was kidnapped, with Nyaruko hypothesizing that it has to do with sononium; when Hasuta asks what that is, Nyaruko explains that it's a mysterious nutrient created when Yoriko embraces Mahiro. Mahiro doesn't see how that could possibly be it since sononium is just something Yoriko made up.

Nyaruko takes them to R'lyeh in her super amphibious car; when Mahiro asks why she didn't use it before, Nyaruko says they had to follow the progression of mobility by starting out dependent on mass transit like the Dagon, then getting a boat, and then getting an airship (like in a video game). Mahiro yells at her.

They get in a torpedo battle with the Dagon and other defenders of the city and Mahiro gets blasted out of the car somehow. He wakes up with Hasuta inside R'lyeh, with Nyaruko missing. Hasuta somehow decides that this is the time to confess his love to Mahiro; when Mahiro protests that they're both guys, Hasuta says it just turned out that the person he loved was a guy. Mahiro plays a mean trick by telling Hasuta that there's a saying that everything goes in 25 million year-cycles, so in 25 million years they'll find themselves in this same situation again. He says if Hasuta still feels the same way then, confess again and Mahiro will seriously consider his feelings. Hasuta is satisfied with this and has Mahiro pinky swear on it, then uses his sense of smell to detect where Nyaruko and Kuuko are.

I really liked Hasuta. He was super cute, even if he's a guy. As long as he's not going to grow up and get ugly, I think Mahiro should have considered becoming gay for him. I once saw someone online talking about Otoboku and saying "I refuse to believe there is a penis on Mizuho"; this is somewhat where I am with Hasuta. He resembles Aria's Alicia-san, but with flat hair antennae that sort of look like soumen; he's very straightforward and a little shy, but positive and kind and not afraid of getting emotional. His earnest love confession to Mahiro was very cute. Even though the trick Mahiro played to get out of the situation was a little mean, it was nice of him to try and save Hasuta from the pain of flat-out rejection. He even had to remind himself earlier that Hasuta was a guy when Hasuta took him by the arm and blushed cutely. Since all the aliens can change shapes, I imagine they don't really have a sex in the same way as humans, so that could be why they accept homosexuality so unceremoniously. (Aside from the giggles that it inspires.) I figure he's going to become incredibly minor in later episodes (he's in the opening and ending, so he sticks around, but he's probably not going to do much), but I like him. Although I like Nyaruko and Kuuko too, more than I would have expected.

I didn't expect this show to actually have a story, ever, even a minor sort of one like this. But it works; I want to see the next episode more than I would have if I knew it was just going to be more gags and fighting (not that that's bad; that is why I watch the show. It's just not as effective at getting me to turn on the next one). 

If you asked HP Lovecraft, I imagine he'd say that this show is more horrific than anything he ever could have conceived of, and from his perspective, it really is. But I like it.

##On Episodes 6 and 7 and 8, January 1st, 2014:

In Episode 7, it turns out that the story I saw developing in the previous episode was just another joke. Which was fine, because that's why I watch this show.

Hasuta and Mahiro find Nyaruko and Kuuko facing off. Nyaruko asks them to go on ahead and let her face off with Kuuko in a dramatic fashion. They do so, and Nyaruko defeats Kuuko by pretending to have pictures of herself in a swimsuit, so that Kuuko gets distracted and can easily be thrashed. (They're actually pictures of Mahiro that Nyaruko carries with her everywhere in a creepy way.)

As the penalty for her defeat, Kuuko is going to "let" Nyaruko "rape" her, but Nyaruko just wants to know why Kuuko went over to the other side. Kuuko whispers in her ear and Nyaruko seems ready to switch sides as well.

Mahiro and Hasuta come to the big evil control room, where they find the green-haired woman with Yoriko checking out a big machine. The green-haired woman (whose name is Luhy) says she'll never let Hasuta's company have Yoriko. It turns out that the Cthulhu Corporation has created the Xoth (pronouned "eks-oth", like Xbox), an awesome new game console with virtual reality and stuff. Since Yoriko is a master of gaming who collects old consoles, the Cthulhu Corporation wanted to get her input on the console. Hasuta was ordered to find her because his father is chairman of Carcarosa Computer Entertainment, a rival company whose consoles always win the console wars in space (The Star Console Wars?), and the Hasturs wanted to stop the Xoth from benefiting from her advice.

Mahiro is exasperated at this turn of events. Nyaruko and Kuuko come in and Kuuko says she joined Luhy because she really wanted to play the Xoth. Yoriko says there's no doubt that it's cool, but consoles with really expensive hardware tend to do badly because the most important thing is games, and they usually don't have the money left over to make good games, and third-party developers don't want to make the games because the development kits are expensive and the prgramming is difficult. Luhy is devastated to hear this and is even more devastated when her bosses call her and tell her they're canceling the project. In desperation, Luhy activates the Xoth, sending its virtual reality waves out across the world. A horde of angry fish men come in, thinking they're playing a zombie game where they are the zombies. Yoriko pulls out a bunch of forks and uses them like ninja shurikens to dispatch all the fish men. The fish men defeated, Nyaruko (who earlier transformed for no reason) is about to blow up the Xoth, but Kuuko asks that she be allowed to kill her love. She burns it up with fire, and the Xoth is no more.

The five of them (Mahiro, Nyaruko, Kuuko, Yoriko, and Hasuta) are sitting on the beach together reflecting on the coolness of the Xoth. Hasuta says he'd better go back to his father and report what happened; he takes a very bashful leave of Mahiro, with much blushing and fidgeting, causing Mahiro to remark "What a weird kid" after he leaves. The next day, Hasuta appears as another new transfer student in Mahiro's class (of course) and starts living at Mahiro's house (of course).

I was wondering why the species name is Hastur, but the character's name is Hasuta, since they use Nyarko instead of Nyaruko in the subtitles. In the end credits you can see that his name is written in Japanese as ハス太, with the kanji 太 (ta) being a common ending for male names (like when Yui called her guitar "Giita"). In the dialogue they actually say it like "Hasta" though, with the "u" mostly silent. Anyway, it's a joke along the same lines as Nyaruko and Kuuko where they make some insane Lovecraftian word into a normal Japanese name by adding an ending.

In Episode 7, Yoriko wins tickets to an onsen for seven (how convenient—I wouldn't think they'd normally give away so many at once, unless the onsen was just desperate for customers). She convinces Mahiro and the aliens to come, and Nyaruko suggests inviting the reporter girl, Kurei Tamao; Mahiro also invites the guy who sits in front of him, who surprisingly isn't a pervert (unfortunately he's very forgettable, so I can't remember his name).

There's also a beach at the onsen, so the group spends the first day hanging out there. The aliens all pursue their loves strongly, leading Tamao to wonder which one of them Mahiro likes (while watching them all pulling on each other in the surf). Nyaruko plans to rape Mahiro while on this trip, and Hasuta is also plotting to get closer to Mahiro, although he isn't so rape-happy as the girls. That night, Nyaruko sneaks into Mahiro's room and tries to rape Mahiro, but Mahiro manages to overpower her and ties her to the table with a sheet around her so she can't talk and can't move. (I thought he'd be doomed since ryokan usually only give you chopsticks to eat with, but he had a fork from somewhere.) Meanwhile, Kuuko is eagerly waiting for Nyaruko to come rape her.

The next morning at breakfast, Nyaruko claims that she and Mahiro had sex and she's now pregnant with Mahiro's child. Mahiro gets mad and Hasuta is devastated. Yoriko knows it's a lie, but she does tell Nyaruko that she gives her permission for them to date for a while, although she says she's not ready to let Mahiro go yet, so marriage isn't on the table at this point. Mahiro is mad at his mother for not backing him up when he tried to use her authority to get Nyaruko off his case.

Mahiro tries his best to ditch Nyaruko and hang out with his buddy for a while (or pretty much anyone except her), but nothing works. He thinks about using Kuuko against her and finds Kuuko sitting in the inn playing an old game like always. Mahiro tries to start up a conversation with her about old games. Kuuko talks for a while, saying that she misses her love, the Xoth, but she tells Mahiro that setting her flag won't get him anywhere since she only loves Nyaruko.

Mahiro finally gets so annoyed that he tells Nyaruko he doesn't like her. Nyaruko turns grey and won't move. Kuuko tries to cheer her up, unsuccessfully (since her idea of "cheer up" is "rape"). Yoriko convinces Mahiro to apologize to her, and Mahiro ends up having to spend a whole day with her on a date. They actually have a good time (although even Nyaruko's threat to turn grey again won't get him into the sex museum); in the end they go to a festival and have fun lighting sparklers on the beach. Mahiro asks why Nyaruko always acts like such a lunatic and Nyaruko tells him that it's because it's embarrassing to admit how much she loves him without doing it in an insane way, but she says she really does love him and wants to shack up. Mahiro thinks she might not be so bad after all.

In Episode 8, the whole group goes into town to find old video games at thrift shops. At some point they also eat takoyaki at a restaurant run by Luhy, now that she's lost her job. Mahiro notices there's a Cthulhu on the sign and starts to wonder just what kind of octopus is in those takoyaki. Hasuta is nervous at first since their races are enemies, but Luhy says they don't need to be enemies anymore since she doesn't work for Cthulhu Corporation anymore.

At a shop, they find an old video game that sucks them all into another world. All of them have taken up parts in a dating sim that's a lot like Tokimeki Memorial. Yoriko has become a weird hadaka apron mother; the guy that sits in front of Mahiro now can only say one line (he asks if Mahiro wants to see the book that shows how much all the girls like him); and Nyaruko, Kuuko, Hasuta, and Tamao have all become heroines. Luhy comes in and explains that Mahiro has to reach a good ending with one of them to escape from the game world.

Mahiro first encounters Nyaruko when he runs into her as she hurries to school and sees her panties, in a scene which looked to me like a purposeful reproduction of the alternate world Rei's encounter with Shinji in the last episode of Eva. He meets Kuuko outside the gate of the school, where she greets him with a "Gokigen yo" and straightens his tie, then proclaims that "Azathoth-sama Watches Over Us". (This joke was awesome. This seems to be Kuuko's thing; in another episode she claimed that she could make really good sandwiches, and when Mahiro asks what kind, she says "Dunwiches", in reference to the Lovecraft story "The Dunwich Horror" where Dagon appeared.) Hasuta has become the sports girl (basketball, to be precise), although he complains that the part doesn't fit him. (If he were a girl, he'd be more like the earnest and meek librarian type, like Negima's Nodoka Miyazaki.)

Nyaruko and Hasuta spend the whole time going after Mahiro, while Kuuko tries to hook up with Nyaruko and tries to get Mahiro into the Hasuta ending. They do the usual renai game events, including a Christmas event where Hasuta gives Mahiro a doll of himself to do whatever he likes with, wherever he likes it; Kuuko gives him a shear negligee to give to Nyaruko; and Nyaruko tries to give him marriage papers, but then gives him a scarf that she knit herself, winning the event. There's also an event where Nyaruko and Mahiro work at a family restaurant together; the restaurant is called "Derleth's", after August Derleth, the author who took up the Cthulhu Mythos after Lovecraft's death, and the logo looks suspiciously like Denny's. During this scene, Nyaruko wears her hair in a ponytail and talks in a slightly higher voice, making herself oddly like Popura Taneshima; Mahiro's waiter uniform also looks just like Sota Takanashi's uniform.

After Christmas, the aliens get tired of screwing around and decide to just fight. They have a three-way battle in which Nyaruko triumphs. Meanwhile, Tamao tries to seduce Mahiro in the PE shed, saying she wanted to do the come-from-behind Tamao route victory.

Since Nyaruko won, she shows up at the tree at the end and Mahiro has to kiss her. He does, getting them all out of the game, but no one remembers anything except Mahiro; Nyaruko has no memory at all of the kiss.

I was all right with the sweet moments in Episode 7, but the humor in Episodes 6 and 8 were really the sort of thing that I watch this show for.  Still, it was kind of nice to hear that Nyaruko is serious about her love and it isn't all just a game to her. (Kuuko is serious about her love too. She's serious about everything. So is Hasuta, which is kind of what makes his case sad, since Mahiro definitely isn't interested in being with a guy.) Even though lots of shows have done TokiMemo parodies, most of them don't have moe girl versions of eldritch monstrosities in them (that's pretty much the show's shtick, isn't it?).
