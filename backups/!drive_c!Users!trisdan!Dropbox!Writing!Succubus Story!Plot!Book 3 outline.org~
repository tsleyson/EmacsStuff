* Book 3
Use multiple perspectives for this story. The main one is still James (maybe he's the only first-person perspective and the others are third-person).

** Prologue: 

Follow a college student at James’s school who’s been going around to the bars and carrying a fake ID (that he hasn’t had to use once yet). This student happened to make the acquaintance of a hot young chick, and he’s waiting for her when a sexy older lady approaches him and starts coming on pretty hard. She invites him to her car and drives them to an empty lot somewhere on the outskirts of town to have sex, but instead of having sex, she ties him up and leaves him in the car after rigging up some kind of tripwire. 

After about ten minutes, the hot young chick shows up, but when she opens the door, the car blows up, taking her and him.

(Of course, the hot young chick was a succubus. She marked the boy the previous night and was going to feed on him that night. The sexy older lady was Eileen Young, and she totally blew up that guy just to kill the succubus.)

** Chapter 1: James I

James and Sophia have stopped hanging out at school since James decided he can't be around her and her supernaturalness anymore.  Latrom stops him after class one day and (very unprofessionally) mocks his sexual prowess with regards to Sophia and says maybe he'll steal her, since she must want a real man. James says Sophia is going out to a bar tonight and this is Latrom's chance to seduce her, since they're now breaking up because James's limp noodle couldn't satisfy her, just as Latrom says. He tells Latrom he'll bring him to the bar Sophia will be at, and his only request is that Latrom allow him to watch when he does Sophia, so he can see how a real man does it.

James brings Latrom to the bar. They wait for Sophia to show up while Latrom brags about how he once did a pair of twin sisters who were taking his class and who both loved his ability to quote Ayn Rand from memory. James rolls his eyes and says he's going to the bathroom. Sophia actually had no intention of coming to a bar that night, but James calls her on his cell phone and asks her to come and meet him at the bar, and Sophia says she can't because she started driving to Reno just after school got out and she won't be back until Monday (it's Friday night). 

When James comes back, Latrom isn't at their table anymore. In fact, he doesn't seem to be in the bar at all. James decides he probably left and isn't coming back, and he decides to have one drink and then go home. While drinking his drink, James hears +some other guys down the bar talking about the explosion on the outskirts of town the other night. He asks them about it and hears that no one knows anything except that a car blew up in an abandoned lot on the outskirts of town. +On his way back, he's captured by Lillith Queen, the succubus hunter.+ some guy burst into the bar and yell that a car just exploded in an abandoned lot on the outskirts of town and everybody should go to see the party.

James goes to investigate the abandoned lot and finds the police have already set up a cordon there and he can’t get in. He tries to strike up a conversation with one of the police deputies, but the guy won’t talk to him and just tells him to bug off. However, by pure luck, James overhears from some people nearby that the person who was killed was called Ron Schmidt (they were with him at the bar and lost track of him when he wandered off; they told the succubus that he’d wandered off somewhere when she came to meet him), and wonders if it’s the same Ron Schmidt he used to work with at Burger King. Ron Schmidt was four years younger than James and constantly horny; he used to go to the bathrooms to whack off during breaks. James used to sell him peepshots of women from around town. He also had an annoying habit of saying “I’m da Schmidt” at random times because it sounded like “I’m da shit”, which was popular back then.

James goes home and runs a script he has that can hack the college’s computer system. He doesn’t know anything about programming, but he’s been told that the college’s computer systems are awful and outdated, subject to hundreds of security flaws, and it’s easy to hack them and steal a copy of their database. He has one already, but it’s probably too out of date to have Schmidt’s information.

James gets a copy of the database and finds Schmidt’s name in it, along with a list of classes. He happens to discover that Amber is in the database as being in Schmidt’s sexual psychology class. He is completely puzzled by this.

** Chapter 2: Sophia I

Sophia is on her way to Reno for the weekend to check in with one of her handlers, a vampire called Elise Levesque (yes, named after Stargate Universe actress Elise Levesque). She’s doing so because of a strange phone call she received from Lucy the other day. Lucy admitted that although she barely knows Sophia and they’ve never met face-to-face, she received information that Sophia and James were both in danger from a source she’s not willing to identify, and she thought Sophia was the one who could do something about it. She also revealed that she knows Sophia is a succubus, and added that although she doesn’t think Sophia is trying to harm her brother, if anything does happen to him, Lucy won’t let it go, even if she is just a human.

Sophia contacted Levesque, who was expecting her call and asked her to come to Reno. She arrives at the hotel to find that MASC (Mothers Against Supernatural Creatures) is holding a convention there. She has a rendezvous with Levesque, who explains that Lucy’s information comes from outside the system (i.e. the person who told her isn’t part of the Organization and may even be from a rival group), but it seems to be reliable. Levesque thinks that the person who’s coming to kill Sophia will be at the MASC convention, and she wants Sophia to work with her to track that person down and kill them first.

Sophia is familiar with MASC; it’s one of a few front groups for the entire network of West Coast anti-supernatural militias, which includes various freaks such as the Suc Succers (an all-women extermination militia), the Templars Reborn (an evangelical paramilitary group which once held Sophia captive), the Baptists by Fire (BBF, another paramilitary group which is mostly African-American and also paramilitary in nature), GWAS (Gay Women Against Succubi), and the Second Amenders (a paramilitary / political action group which fights gun control legislation and also the supernatural). MASC functions both as a recruitment arm for the other organizations and as the weapons / R&D department, by hiring people like Langston to provide them with the knowledge to create tools that can detect the supernatural. They also provide counseling and support for people who lose loved ones to the supernatural. Outwardly, their name is “Mothers and Spouses Confederacy” and they’re made up of military wives and mothers who support the military with letters, care packages, and charity donations, passing off their R&D money as spent on developing better weapons and armor for the soldiers.

Sophia asks how they’re going to get into that convention when they’ll be detected as supernatural creatures and killed. Levesque says Sophia wasn’t the only one she asked to come, and right about that moment, there’s a knock on the hotel room door, and June Sullivan comes in.

** Chapter 3: James II

James goes to Ron Schmidt’s sexual psychology class and finds Amber as she comes out. He asks her what she knows about Ron Schmidt. Amber playfully asks if he isn’t going to ask how she got into college when she never even finished high school. James says he already knows, this place will let anyone in, and says she sure has lowered her sights from last time, from taking over the city to getting a college education. Amber says she seduced the guy from the admissions office to falsify some records, and James realizes that she’s a succubus. 

James and Amber go to the cafeteria to talk, just as he and Sophia did in the first book. Amber says she’s not mad at him anymore, because he gave her the best gift of all: he told her how to become a succubus. Just before Austen died, Amber incited Austen to rape her. She did and said various things to annoy him, like calling him a fag (since he also raped boys) and mocking the size of his penis. (James asks “How big was it? Really?” and Amber says “Vienna sausage. The canned ones.”)  That was three days before he died. Amber was afraid it hadn’t worked since it wasn’t really rape, since she wanted it, even if she only wanted it so she could be a succubus, but it did work, and another two days or so after Austen’s death, Amber woke up and found that the teeth James had knocked out when he hit her with the folding metal chair had magically grown back.

After that, Amber’s first victim was her mother’s boyfriend, who she got in the same way by inciting him to rape her when her mother wasn’t around. She discovered a little later how to release pheromones, and she seduced an old man who lived alone on the outskirts of town, sucked out his life, and took over his house. She’s now been living in town and seducing men for the past several months, but she got tired of seducing dirty old guys and taking their stuff, and started wanting to after some younger people with more money so she could get better stuff. After she got a guy from the college with a nice cell phone, she realized there were lots of guys with money at the college, so she enrolled and started taking classes. 

James brings the conversation back around to Ron Schmidt. Amber says he was a freaking pervert who would always bring the conversation to the gutter. She didn’t bother to go after him since he didn’t seem to have any money or any good stuff, but she noticed a few days ago that another succubus had put her mark on him and figures he’s dead now. James says he is dead, but not by succubus: he was killed in a car explosion last night. Amber says she doesn’t know anything about that and suggests he find the succubus who tagged Schmidt and ask her. She leaves, leaving James alone with his thoughts as he wonders if he’s getting out of his depth again now that succubuses are involved and whether he shouldn’t just leave it alone. He gets out his phone and wonders if he should call Sophia, apologize, and ask for her help.

** Chapter 4: Sophia II

June Sullivan tells Sophia she’s aware that Sophia and James have been working together and that’s why she contacted James when her neighbor had the problem with Langston. Sophia asks Levesque what she’s doing here, and Levesque says she tracked June down because she had a strong suspicion that Saron Young was coming west. [Yes, her name is different, and I think also her race—she should be black or Middle Eastern, or maybe Indonesian. Possibly even Indian. Maybe she’s very international and no one knows her exact racial makeup, but it looks like a mixture of all those things.] Sophia asks who Saron Young is, and June says maybe Sophia knows her better as Amanirenas, but Sophia still hasn’t heard of her. 

Levesque explains that Amanirenas is an assassin who hunts succubi and vampires and any of the other human-shaped, essentially sexual supernatural creatures. (She doesn’t care about the werewolves or the dragons or the frost giants or any of the others; she hates succubi, vampires, and anything else that kills with sex.) June met her in the past; in fact, June was raped by an incubus in a bar in her early twenties, when she was going to college back in Massachusetts, and became a succubus. Saron Young found her, took her captive, and was going to kill her, but realized that June hadn’t yet taken any lives as a succubus and wanted to become human again, so she hunted down the incubus that did it and killed him, allowing June to bathe in his blood and become human again.

Levesque says they can have June go to the MASC convention and look for Saron Young. Not only is she human, she’s actually a member of MASC. Sophia is startled and asks if they can trust her, and June smirks and says if you were not only raped and became a succubus, but then, fifteen years later, your son was raped by an incubus and became pregnant, wouldn’t that turn you against the supernatural? Sophia admits that she sees what June means. Levesque warns June that at the first sign of betrayal, her son won’t have a mother to come home to him, but June says she has no reason to betray them to MASC; that would be like hating all black people because some black man killed her husband. She also says that although she’s grateful to Saron Young for saving her when she was young, she’s also grateful to James and Sophia for helping her son by getting rid of Austen; she later called James and heard from him how Austen died, and feels Austen got what he deserved. 

Just as Levesque is about to start explaining how June will sneak into the MASC convention, there’s a knock at the hotel door. Levesque says she didn’t order room service and there shouldn’t be anyone else coming. 

Levesque opens the door and gets immediately shot in the head. A young Asian woman comes inside and is about to shoot June, but Sophia throws herself in the way and manages to reach the woman and grab her and disarm her. 

Sophia pinions the woman’s arms and June pats her down, searching for more weapons, and finds two knives and a boot gun. Sophia asks who she is and why she came, and the woman says she’s not going to talk. Levesque gets up, not quite dead, and says it doesn’t matter; they’ve clearly been targeted by someone. She orders Sophia to take June and go back to the town where the college is whose name I’ve forgotten. She’ll handle the rest here.

** Chapter 5: James III


** orig
but by pure bad luck, she isn't there and the serial killer is. She captures both of them and locks them up in a foreclosed house where she's set up home base (she also has Amber there, weak and starved). She keeps Amber pacified with a variety of weapons, including a taser, a baton, and a big machete (since Amber still has some regeneration ability); she hacked apart Amber's wings with the machete to keep her from flying away, and it hasn't healed yet.

Eileen Young, aka Lilith Queen, has been traveling around killing succubi and men who associate with them. She has a variety of succubus-tracking and -killing devices that she got from WAS (Wives Against Succubi), a secret organization of women who want to kill off all succubi. She's totally ruthless about getting what she wants, which is dead succubi, and she has no problem at all killing humans to get it. She captured Amber using one of her usual honey pot tricks where she follows a man who's been scent-marked, kills him, and waits for the succubus to show up to defend her prey.

Queen keeps both men weak by taking sperm samples and artificially inseminating Amber. This can't kill them, but it does weaken them, similar to a sedative. She also keeps Amber weak by beating and hacking her apart several times a day. Queen is interested when she sees that Amber's pheromones work on Latrom, who once tries to rush the door and break through so he can stop Queen from hurting her, but they have no effect on James. James says it's just because he knows Amber, but Queen says that isn't possible, succubus pheromones should transcend any reason he has. 

Queen has the basement split into two sections by a section of chain-link fence with barbed wire along the top and bottom. James notices there's a loose section in the barbed wire and a tiny space at the top where the fence didn't quite reach the roof. He finds a wooden stake in the corner and uses it to twist the wire around and bend the fence down, after getting Amber's attention and asking if she could break the gate across the stairway and the lock at the top of the stairs. Amber says yes, she thinks so. (She's strait-jacketed to a pillar and beaten, tasered, and chopped to hell, so she can't get over to the gate unless someone frees her.) James doesn't like the sound of that, but says he'll just get over there and free her and they'll figure something out. He figures in a pinch, two grown men and a succubus ought to be able to overpower Queen, even if they're unarmed. 

He gets over the fence, lets Latrom through the gate, and frees Amber. They go to check out the gate, but Amber can barely even move her arms as she is. She says if she had her full strength she could easily break the gate and one of them will have to sacrifice himself. James tries to find a way to get through himself, but Latrom, who's been infatuated with Amber ever since he saw her, basically jumps on her and tears her clothes off, and they're having sex before James can stop them. James asks Latrom if he has any idea what he's done and Latrom says James's limp noodle never could've satisfied a real woman like this anyway. James says that 'real woman' is sixteen, and Latrom doesn't care. Latrom prematurely ejaculates after two thrusts and crumbles into dust, and Amber snaps off the gate and also tears open the cellar door, only to have Queen jam a hatchet into her face as soon as the door opens.

James watches them fight, brutally, after Queen knocks Amber back down into the basement. Amber is blind in one eye because of the hatchet, and also enraged; Queen is calm and methodical. Amber flaps her wings around, trying to confuse Queen, but Queen backs off and uses an awl to pin Amber's wing to the pillar. Queen beats her bloody around the face with a baton and sticks her several times with a combat knife while easily dodging her slashes. 

James makes a break for the door and goes for the front door to try and escape, but he doesn't know which way it is and finds himself cornered by Queen in the kitchen. Queen wonders if this is enough danger for his succubus mistress to show up and James says she's no 'mistress' of his, and in fact she's ugly and smells. Queen asks him how he came to be immune to succubus pheromones and he says he's got no idea, and if she knows, tell him. Queen says if she knew, she would have treated her husband and son and they all wouldn't be there. James asks if she's going to kill him and points out that if she waits too long to get things under control, Amber will be back and will kill her. Queen says Amber won't be a problem anymore and she's not going to kill him, she's going to take him back down to the basement to wait for his mistress to arrive.

Down in the basement, Amber has been completely gutted, like a fish. There's blood everywhere, and entrails, and stomach contents, and other gross stuff. Queen asks Amber why she's fighting her, since when she first saw James she tried to make a bargain to join in the plan and get revenge on Sophia. Amber chokes up some curses and says obviously that went out the window when Queen chopped her up with a machete. Queen can't figure out why Sophia hasn't come yet and says normally she would kill James to provoke a reaction, but she's interested in his resistance to succubus pheromones and wants to keep him alive. 

At that moment, the lights go out, and Queen gets ready for a huge battle. Sophia has finally arrived. They have a huge, epic battle that's like a Hellsing fight. To James's surprise, June Sullivan is also there. Sophia wins (and gets to be a little cool while doing it, since we know how strong Queen is). She doesn't kill Queen, though; she instead offers to tell Queen how James became resistant to succubus pheromones, although she doesn't think it will help Queen. In return, Queen will give James an interview about her past and why she kills succubuses. Amber and James both think that's letting her off way too light, especially after she killed Latrom, but June says she owes this woman her life. She was the one who went to Sophia after James disappeared to tell her about Lilith Queen. When June was in her early twenties, she was raped in a bar and became a succubus. Lilith Queen came to her and told her they could turn her back if they killed the incubus and she bathed in his blood, and together they hunted him down and turned her back. For that reason, she won't let Lilith be killed and only agreed to help Sophia find her on the condition that she wouldn't be killed.  

The final bit is a transcript of the interview between James, Lilith Queen, and Sophia. Sophia tells Lilith that the reason James is immune to succubus pheromones (and in fact has reverse pheromones that attract succubuses to him) is that he was once a victim of a succubus, but that succubus was ordered to stop in the middle by the Tyrant. So unless Lilith knows how to find the Tyrant, it's no good. James asks how that could have happened when he doesn't even remember it, and Sophia says she'll tell him later.

Lilith keeps up her end of the bargain and answers James's questions. Her real name is Eileen Young. One of the women at her husband's job was a succubus and seduced him because he was a vitalis—a man whose energy supply is an exponential function of his years of remaining life, not a linear or logarithmic like most men. Knowing his son would also be a vitalis, the woman came to their house and seduced her son; Eileen happened to walk in on them and tried to stop it, but nothing can stop it once it's begun except the Tyrant. She found WAS, but objected to their passive methods of promoting morality in society and decided to learn how to kill, which she learned from the Malleus Dei and the Templars Reborn. (The Malleus Dei are like the Catholic Church's Iscariot in Hellsing; the Templars Reborn are more of an Evangelical monster hunting outfit. The Malleus Dei are also a lot more dangerous because they hire real military men and special forces, whereas the Templars Reborn are mostly cowboys and dirty rednecks who hate Muslims and Mexicans as much as they hate the supernatural.) She says with the number of people she's killed with her own two hands, Latrom's death doesn't weigh on her at all, and Amber was just another succubus who should die. James calls her insane, and Eileen says she's been called worse, then says he's pretty damned insane too, to be hanging out with a succubus like it's nothing. She asks if he's really going to post that on the Internet, and James says no, it's going on the ever-growing stack of crap he can't publish because it has to do with the supernatural. Eileen asks if, as a favor to her, he'd consider publishing it somewhere, not necessarily on a reputable site and without his own name on it, and says she'd owe him one if he did. James ends the transcript there, before his answer.
