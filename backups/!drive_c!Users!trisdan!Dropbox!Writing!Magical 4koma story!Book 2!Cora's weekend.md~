Cora's weekend. By Nora.
========================
How are you? It's Nora again. Good to see you!

Lily, Ranta, and I got back from the camping trip on Sunday evening, just in time to have dinner in the dining hall. We chose a table together and talked about our trip as we ate.

Partway through our meal, a girl I didn't know came up and sat with us as if it were the most natural thing in the world. She was a cat girl, like Cora, and she even had her hair tied in twin pigtails like Cora. But unlike Cora, her hair was deep, inky black, as if it had been dyed with Chinese calligraphy ink. Also, she wasn't wearing glasses.

I didn't mind if she sat with us, but I thought it was a little strange that Ranta and Lily didn't stop talking to acknowledge her right away. Then I saw her scowling. Cora's scowl.

It was Cora.

"Cora, what happened to your hair?" I asked, causing Lily and Ranta to stop recounting the pine cat we'd seen above the waterfall that morning, and look around at Cora and me.

"Don't ask," Cora growled.

"Looks like your weekend didn't go so well," said Ranta.

"And what happened to your glasses?" I asked. "Aren't you almost blind without them?"

"Just—just don't ask," Cora said again. "It sounds like you three had fun on your camping trip. Just—just talk about that for a while."

Lily and Ranta and I went on talking about the camping trip while Cora scowled at her dinner. Every so often, I would sneak a look at her. I was trying to see if there was anything else different about her, anything that might give me a clue about what had happened to her, but I didn't see anything different. She scowled just like always, though she was being a little quieter than usual and hadn't yet yelled at me or started a fight with Ranta. She just sat, scowling and listening as we talked, eating her chicken Parmesan and scowling at it, scowling at her garlic bread, scowling at her glass of iced tea, and scowling at me whenever she caught me looking at her.

<br />

The next morning, before class, I decided I would ask Cora what had happened. Maybe she hadn't wanted to say in front of Ranta and Lily. Maybe she was afraid Ranta would make fun of her, or Lily would think she wasn't cool. I was pretty sure Lily didn't think she was cool to begin with, but Cora seemed to think there was a chance that Lily did, and she didn't want to ruin it by admitting that she'd done something embarrassing.

Even if Cora didn't want to tell me, I was so curious to know that I had to try asking. When I saw her come into the classroom, I got up and walked up the row towards her desk. She was wearing her glasses again, but her hair was still black.

As I came closer, I began to speak. "Um, C-Cora? Would you t-tell me what h-happened over the week—" I began, but stopped talking when one of the other girls—her name was Willow, I was pretty sure—grabbed me by the wrist as I passed by.

"Hey, new girl," said Willow. "What do you think you're doing, walking towards Cora like you're going to talk to her?"

Another girl, a blonde in a pink shirt with hearts printed all over it, whose name I thought was Ashley, chimed in as well. "Yeah, Cora doesn't want to talk to you. Just go back to your seat and stick your ugly nose in your ugly book, new girl."

"Yeah, new girl," jeered Greta, and Sweta added, "New girl!" as if that by itself were an insult. And the way they said it, it almost was.

I shrank back, getting ready to give up, but then Cora spoke, her words spitting out like a cat hissing in the back of its throat.

"I was trying to get my brother to give me his old record player," she said. "I'll tell you the rest after class."

I thought it best to get out of there as quickly as possible, so I said "Okay, after class", freed myself from Willow's grip, and quickly returned to my own seat.

But after class, Miss Hanover handed back our tests from last week, and Cora and I both discovered that we'd failed math. She kept us for extra lessons so we could go over the problems we'd failed on the tests. After half an hour of math, Miss Hanover let me go, and kept Cora back to work on reading.

I went over to the clubroom and found Lily and Ranta both inside. Lily was tending the plants in the pots and vases, while Ranta sat at the table with a cup of tea.

"So, Lily, I'd like to ask you something," Ranta said just as I came in. She flashed me a smile and indicated that she'd set out a cup and saucer for me at the table. I sat down, and Ranta poured me a cup of jasmine tea, a delicious fragrance rising from the cup as it filled.

"Go ahead, ask me anything," said Lily. "You can ask me anything. I can't answer anything, but I can answer what I can answer."

"You said you have a set of pajamas made by Doris and Phyllis," said Ranta. I sipped my tea and took a chocolate-filled roll cookie from the plate that Ranta passed me.

"I do," said Lily. "I have pajamas made by four different animals that start with *s*—spiders, silkworms, sloths, and seals."

"And it doesn't bother you that you're wearing something made from silk that came from the spider's—the spider's you-know-where?"

"Not really. It just doesn't bother me," said Lily.

"You know where the you-know-where is, right?"

"The abdomen?"

"Uh, yeah, close enough. So how do you deal with it?"

"It just doesn't bother me," Lily repeated.

Ranta nodded meaningfully. I couldn't tell what the meaning was, but I knew it had some meaning. I sipped down my tea and took another roll cookie. Ranta took one too, and then said, "So what happened to Cora? Did either of you find out?"

"Not me," said Lily.

"I tried asking her this morning," I said. "She told me she was trying to get her brother's old record player."

"Trying to get her brother's old record player?" Ranta repeated, confused. "But what does that have to do with her hair turning black?"

"She said she'd tell me after class," I said. "But both of us failed our math tests, so Miss Hanover kept us back to go over them. And after we were done, she kept Cora back to go over the reading test."

"And what about her glasses?" Lily added. "I thought she was blind as a eucalyptus without them."

"Her glasses were back on this morning," I said.

"I know her roommate has the Gift of Singing and likes to blast opera music," said Lily. "That might be why she wanted a record player. She wanted to drown out her roommate."

"But how would that make her hair black?" I asked.

"Maybe her brother made her prove herself," Ranta suggested. "Maybe he made her go on a quest to show she was worthy to receive his old record player. After all, if he's Cora's brother, he's probably pretty twisted, right?"

Lily perked up when she heard that, and a sudden mood struck me, and I said, "Of course, that must be it. Cora's brother was willing to give her the record player, but he wanted a fair trade. He wanted a stone from the bottom of Inky Lake, at the highest peak of the furthest-away mountain. Cora knew there was only one way to get it: she had to go there, dive into the lake, and pull it out."

"Since they didn't have them at the gift shop," said Ranta.

"Cora started to climb the  mountain. She climbed up the winding trail, scaled many crags, and clambered up countless crevasses  to get up to the peak."

As I spoke, all three of us could feel ourselves leaving the comfortable clubroom at the school and going off to the peak of the faraway mountain. The scent of jasmine tea became the scent of pine, and the flowers became poison oak and bramble. It helped that we'd just spent a weekend in the wilds ourselves; I could imagine the mountain near our campgrounds, where we'd spent Saturday and half of Sunday looking at rocks and trees and the river.

"Cora even had to fight a pine cat," I continued. "She came up to where it was eating a rack of ribs, and she said 'Give me those ribs, pine cat!'"

"And the pine cat said, 'Get your own!' So Cora punched him in the nose. And he left the ribs behind, and said, 'I'll get you for this someday!' But after she'd fought the pine cat for them, Cora just left the ribs behind."

"After a while, Cora came to a village of dwarves. The dwarves told her that a cruel witch was menacing them, flying over each day, cackling and screeching, throwing balls of fire at them and burning down their workshops and stopping them from making their flagship product."

"They were very practical dwarves," said Ranta, "and where other dwarves might have wasted their time making golden rings or emerald necklaces, these dwarves made—"

"Tuna cans?" Lily asked.

"Zipper pulls?" I suggested, after a glance down at my book bag.

"The prongs of lamp plugs!" said Ranta.

I picked up the story again. "The dwarves told Cora they had a secret path that could lead her halfway to the summit. But they would only let her use it if she could stop the witch from menacing them, so they could get back to making practical things like tuna cans, zipper pulls, and the prongs of lamp plugs."

"Cora agreed. She went off and found the witch, who lived in a squat little cabin on the side of the mountain. Cora thought the best way to defeat the witch would be to challenge her to a game of wits."

"Of course, Cora lost the game of wits," said Ranta.

"And she now found herself tied up," said Lily, "lying on the witch's table. 'You'll make me a fine meal!' the witch cackled—" And here Lily did a very good witch cackle, which took me by surprise and sent a chill down my spine.

"Fortunately," I said, "Cora had been inside Lily's garden before she started climbing the mountain. She had something in her pocket that could defeat that witch."

"Cora told the witch, 'Witch, I don't mind if you eat me, but I'm afraid I won't taste very good without seasoning. There are some herbs in my pocket. Please use them to season me.'"

"And the witch did. What she didn't know was that the herb in Cora's pocket was blustersage. As soon as she seasoned Cora, Cora ate a few leaves. And she huffed, and she puffed, and she blew the witch's house down!"

"Cora then chewed through her ropes with her sharp fangs. Freed from her ties, Cora started to insult the witch. 'You've got a wart on your nose! Why not see a doctor about that?' she mocked. The witch was so offended that she turned into a housefly and flew away."

"And Cora," said Ranta, "being a cat, was able to catch her and swallow her down, where she melted in Cora's stomach acid."

The three of us laughed for a while at the image of Cora swallowing the fly, before we continued.

"The dwarves allowed Cora to use their secret path. But they told her there was one more danger to face: just before the summit, there lived a vicious giant named Andre, who loved to dance" I said. "He would challenge anyone who passed to a dance-off, and anyone who couldn't dance better than him got eaten!"

"Cora made her way up the path, towards the summit. But just before she reached the top, she ran into the giant, Andre. Andre was big, huge, hideous, and slobbering. He stank like a thousand piles of garbage and a hundred sewers. His teeth were yellow and black, like a hive of bees. When he spoke, his horrible breath wafted across Cora, carrying a great stench of the gum disease gingivitis."

"Andre then hitched up his white pants and put on his white jacket," said Ranta, "and he led Cora onto his dance floor, his disco ball spinning high above them, and said 'This is my Platinum Disco! If you can show that your disco is more platinum than mine, I'll let you past. Otherwise, I'll be polishing you off the platinum in my teeth!'"

"Then Andre danced," I said, "and the mountain rumbled, and the ground shook, with the force of his groovy moves."

"But Cora had a secret weapon," Lily joined in. "In her pocket, she had three choreographed carrots she had taken from the garden. These carrots would sync up their movements with hers, making them perfect backup dancers."

"Cora danced, and the choreographed carrots danced with her," I said. "And they danced, and they danced, and even Andre was forced to admit that Cora's disco was more platinum than his. But Andre had no intention of playing fair. He tried to grab Cora and eat her anyway!"

"But Cora had one last trick up her sleeve," said Lily. "She had a handful of spring-heeled onions in her pocket. When she ate them, she gained super jumping abilities. Cora jumped over Andre and sprung up the rest of the peak, all the way to the summit, leaving Andre shaking his fist at her."

"Now she'd finally reached the summit," I said. "It was time to dive into Inky Lake and claim an inkstone."

"Cora dived in, and the dark waters dyed her hair deep black, just as we saw it when she walked in last night and I didn't recognize her. She grabbed a stone and surfaced, thinking herself victorious, only to be grabbed by a hawk!"

"The hawk was a friend of the pine cat whose ribs Cora had stolen earlier. His friend the pine cat had sent him to get revenge on Cora for stealing those ribs. The hawk told Cora he was going to bring her back to his nest and eat her."

"Then he'd throw her up for his chicks," Ranta added, to cries of "Eww!" and "Gross!" from me and Lily.

"But the hawk didn't count on Cora's sharp tongue. Cora called the hawk names and said terrible things about his family, things so cruel he had to cry. But being a tough hawk, he didn't want anyone to see him crying, so he lifted a claw to wipe his eyes. And when he did, he dropped Cora"

"But Cora had stolen one more plant from the garden," I said. "Icarus palm leaves. With these, she was able to fly home. But just because she could fly, that didn't mean she could land."

"Cora crashed into the roof of her house and fell down the chimney. She emerged into her living room in a cloud of soot and ash."

"When her little sister saw Cora,  she thought Santa Claus had come early that year, and she begged for a present. But Cora had nothing to give her. To make her little sister stop crying, Cora gave her the inkstone."

"But Cora's brother, being just as wicked and cruel as Cora," said Ranta, "told her 'You didn't deliver me the inkstone. You failed your quest.' And after all that, Cora didn't get the record player after all."

At that moment, Cora opened the door and came in.

I froze. My heart was pounding. Had she heard us? If she had, she was definitely going to yell at me.

Cora sat down at the table and sighed. "Glad that's over."

"So, Cora, I hear you didn't do so well on your exams," said Ranta casually. "You know, *I* passed everything."

"Just shut up. Please, just shut your ugly face," Cora muttered. "I'm not in the mood to listen to you right now."

Trying to defuse the situation, I stood up and poured Cora a cup of tea, and offered her roll cookies, hoping the sweets would calm her down. I was planning to wait for her  to work her way through five or six of them before I piped up, but Lily, much braver than me, beat me to it.

"So, Cora, about your hair..." Lily said.

"Oh, yeah. See, my roommate, Victoria, has the Gift of Singing," said Cora. "She loves opera. It gets pretty annoying after a while, listening to the soprano parts from *Carmen* and *The Phantom of the Opera* and *The Ring of the Nibelungs* every day. So I asked Lucian, my brother, if I could borrow his old record player. I was hoping I could drown Victoria out, at least for a little while."

"Lucian told me he wouldn't give it to me unless I beat him in a challenge, even though that jerk hasn't used the thing since I was five years old. But I really wanted it, so I took the challenge."

"What did he make you do?" Lily asked.

"He made me take allergy pills and try to stay awake. Every ten minutes I stayed awake, it was another pill."

It was just like Cora to completely ignore the possibility of death because she wanted a record player. Taking a pill every ten minutes could have killed her, if it was the wrong kind of pill. But Cora's brother was in medical school, so I guessed he knew which pills were dangerous.

"I fell asleep after about thirty minutes, and when I woke up, that jerk had dyed my hair black. My parents yelled at me for dying my hair. Last night, Mrs. Lovett yelled at me for dying my hair. This morning, Miss Hanover—didn't yell at me, but I could see her trying not to laugh at me when I told her how this happened."

Mrs. Lovett was the dorm mother; it was her job to make sure we did our laundry and kept our rooms clean, and it was also her job to organize and lead the cleaning crews that took care of the common areas. Every student had to take part in a cleaning crew at least once a month; Mrs. Lovett was strict about that. She was strict about everything, so it was easy to imagine her being strict with Cora for breaking the rule on hair dyeing.

"Well, maybe it was all worth it," said Lily, turning back to her plants to resume watering. "After all, you got the record player. Now you can drown out Victoria."

"No," said Cora. "That's the worst part."

"What?" I asked, curiosity overcoming fear.

"When I went back to my room to drop my stuff off, after Miss Hanover let me out, Victoria told me she'd made up a new song. It was called 'I Cannot Be Drowned Out By Cora's Brother's Old Record Player'. When she sang it, not only did I hear every bit of it no matter how loud I turned up the volume, after a few minutes, the record player broke in half. It's gone now."

It's not quite as fantastical as the story that Lily, Ranta, and I made up together, but Cora did have an interesting weekend.
