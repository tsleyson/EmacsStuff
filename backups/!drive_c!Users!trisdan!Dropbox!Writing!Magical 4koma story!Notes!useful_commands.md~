To resize a bunch of images on the command line using Bash:

for f in *.jpg; do convert -resize <width> $f ${f%%.jpg}"ext.jpg"; done

That renames the resized files to the original filename plus ext.jpg. I assume ou can give $f twice and get the files replaced with the resized versions.

convert is part of ImageMagick.

To make sure only images bigger than the size you input are resized:

convert <fname> -resize AxB\>
