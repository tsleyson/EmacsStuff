<p>How are you? I’m Amaranta, but call me Ranta.</p>
<p>We’ve never spoken before, but the last time you heard about me, I was running off into the dark forest to save my friend Nora. We had gone camping with the geology club, but we got separated from our group and ended up lost in the forest. We tried to find the campsite, but we didn’t figure out how to read our map until it was already late in the afternoon. We didn’t think we had enough time to get there before dark, so we decided to spend the night in a grove of oak trees, whose tops had twisted into a little roof. But we ran into some bad luck when it turned out the grove was actually the front doorstep of two giant spiders, who chased us out into the night and came after us.</p>
<p>When we saw those giant spiders, huge, ugly things with hideous fangs, each the size of a pony, I knew we had to escape. If I had been alone, I could have easily gotten away with my Gift of Running, which lets me run further and faster than anyone. But I couldn’t have carried Nora with me, and she couldn’t have kept up. So I told her to hide while I distracted the spiders and lured them away. Then, after I had drawn the spiders away, she could start for the campsite. I’m not going to ask you to praise me for this, unlike Cora, my rival. All I did was try to save my friend. That’s not the sort of thing you should be praised for—it’s the sort of thing you should do without a second thought, as a matter of course. That’s what I think, anyway.</p>
<p>Running at night is hard, and that goes double in the forest. I couldn’t really see where I was going, since it was dark and the trees overhead were so thick that even the moonlight barely made it through. I also had to watch my feet and make sure I didn’t trip on any rocks, roots, or branches, or slip on any pine needles or any patches of loose dirt. I had a flashlight, but its beam only shined about ten feet ahead, and I was covering ten feet about every three seconds, so I only had a small window of time to check the ground in front of me and make sure I wasn’t about to go falling on my face and feed myself to the spiders.</p>
<p>I looked back every so often to make sure the spiders were still behind me, but not too far. If they fell back too far, they might give up and go back to the grove, and Nora might not be far enough away yet. I wanted them to think they could catch me. There was no way they could catch me—even if they never got tired, I could run so far away that it would take them days to get there at the speed they were moving. Even Nora could probably outrun them if she were fully rested, but we’d been walking half the day and hadn’t gotten any sleep.</p>
<p>I noticed myself pulling ahead, so I slowed down a little to let the spiders catch up. I was about to take off again when I heard a voice.</p>
<p>“Wait! Don’t run! We don’t want to hurt you!”</p>
<p>I stopped. There was no way that spider had just talked to me.</p>
<p>“Yes, please don’t run! We don’t want to hurt you. We only want to talk.”</p>
<p>I heard the leaves rustling under sixteen legs, and I turned my flashlight on the spiders, who had come to a stop about twenty feet away from me.</p>
<p>“Did you just talk?” I asked, feeling stupid for even thinking it.</p>
<p>“Yes, we did,” said one of the spiders. I didn’t actually see its mouth move—even its two huge fangs were still—but the voice unmistakably came from its direction. It was a woman’s voice, a hoarse and croaky voice like an old grandmother.</p>
<p>“We didn’t want to hurt you,” said the other spider, its voice also old and croaky. “I’m sorry we put such a scare into you.”</p>
<p>“Why did you chase me?” I asked. “What do you want?”</p>
<p>“We wanted to sell to you,” said the first spider. “We thought you were a customer.”</p>
<p>“A customer of what?”</p>
<p>“We weave fine clothes, sheets, and curtains out of silk,” said the spider. “If you please, I’m Doris and this is Phyllis. We’re the Weaving Spider Sisters.”</p>
<p>You might have found it hard to believe that two gigantic spiders could actually be harmless, silk-weaving old ladies, and I certainly did, so I asked them, “How do I know you’re telling the truth?”</p>
<p>The first spider, which had called itself Doris, took a sack from its back and tossed it to me. I opened the sack, and inside were shirts, sheets, nightgowns, and other clothes, all made from silk and expertly dyed. I rubbed the material of a beautiful crimson blouse between my fingers. It was the best silk I had ever seen, not that I was an expert in silk.</p>
<p>“Do you live inside the mountain?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. We deal with shopkeepers and traders, and they all know the grove is our signpost. We heard you outside and thought someone had come to do business.”</p>
<p>“We apologize for scaring you,” added the second spider, which had called itself Phyllis.</p>
<p>“If this is true, then maybe you can help me. I’m trying to find the campsite. Can you guide me there?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Doris.</p>
<p>“And my friend. I told her to hide, then make for the campsite. Is she safe in this forest?”</p>
<p>The two spiders shivered, and clattered their fangs, seeming disturbed. “What is it?” I asked.</p>
<p>“If your friend had stayed at the grove,” said Phyllis, “all would be well. Our third sister, Bea, is there, and would have made sure no harm befell her. But in the direction of the campsite, there lives a dangerous hermit. He traps any who wander that way, lures them to his cabin, and puts them into his machine to steal their water, leaving them dried out husks. Your friend may be in danger.”</p>
<p>I felt my blood chill once again. “Where is his cabin?” I asked.</p>
<p>“At the foot of the hill, thirty minutes’ walk from our grove, perhaps,” said Doris.</p>
<p>“I’m going for her. If you mean us well as you say, then come after me and help. I can make it worth your while.”</p>
<p>“You mean to say you’ll buy from us?” asked Doris.</p>
<p>“Better. My family owns Eufemia, the clothing store. If you help us, I can convince my parents to buy your silk and sell it in our stores. You could make a lot of money.”</p>
<p>Doris and Phyllis exchanged a look, although it was hard to tell what it meant, with them being spiders. “We’ll help you,” said Doris. “We don’t <em>need</em> repayment, mind you, but afterward, if you happen to feel at all grateful to us…”</p>
<p>I couldn’t really promise that my parents would buy their silk. After all, I’m just a kid. I’m not part of their business. Still, I said, “If you help me rescue my friend, I’ll talk to my parents for you. Your craftsmanship and material look first-rate, so I’m sure they’ll be happy to buy from you.”</p>
<p>I asked the spiders to follow me as quickly as they could, and I set off, now running at full speed.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Running through the forest at night at full speed is even more difficult, but I had to reach the cabin and make sure Nora wasn’t there. The spiders had said it was about a thirty minutes’ walk from the grove to the cabin, and I had been running from them for at least five minutes, but at full speed I could cover a mile in six minutes, and I made quick work of the distance, dodging and hopping between the branches and over the soft spots in the dirt.</p>
<p>I came to a log cabin at the foot of the hill, without windows, with a low thatched roof. I could see the flickering of a lantern or candle between the cracks in the logs, and I could hear the squeaking of rusted metal and an odd, muffled sound that might have been someone trying to scream through a gag.</p>
<p>I knocked on the door of the cabin, but there was no answer. I knocked again, harder this time. Still no answer. I tried turning the knob, but it was locked. I glanced at the hinges on the door. They weren’t held on with screws or nails; they were stuck in with wooden pegs, hammered through the holes straight into the ends of the logs.</p>
<p>I moved back about a hundred feet from the door. With my weight and strength, I would normally never be able to break through. But my Gift of Running was good for more than just beating Cora in the mile run. After all, the force of an object is based on its momentum, and the momentum is based on both the mass and the speed.</p>
<p>Speed was my kingdom.</p>
<p>I dug my feet into the ground and took off, throwing my legs under me so fast that I almost fell on my face. I managed to stay upright, moving so fast I was almost flying, pushing myself to go faster, faster, faster.</p>
<p>The door loomed ahead of me. I pushed off the ground with my feet, jumping into the air, and slammed the soles of both shoes into the door.</p>
<p>The door flew off its hinges and slammed into the wooden floor, me on top of it. I landed hard on my butt. My tailbone felt bruised, but otherwise I was fine.</p>
<p>Inside, the cabin was full of metal rods and black rubber hoses. The rods and hoses all twisted around each other in a complicated setup that led back down to Nora, strapped to a chair, with a band of leather around her mouth stopping her from making any sound. As soon as she saw me, she began struggling against her restraints, the metal chair creaking and squeaking and shaking.</p>
<p>The hermit, a stooped old man in a wooden mask, with a long white beard and long ragged robes, looked up from his panel of instruments and saw me. “Is the bottled water good?” he asked, advancing on me with a length of rope in his hands.</p>
<p>I jumped to my feet, ran at the hermit, and tried the same jump kick I had used against the door. My feet sank into his robes, through several layers of clothes, and the hermit stumbled back, unhurt. I hadn’t been able to gain enough speed to do any damage to him.</p>
<p>“Come after me!” I cried, trying to get up and run, but the hermit grabbed my ankle and coiled the rope around my leg. I kicked out at him, struggling to free myself, and managed to get to my feet.</p>
<p>The hermit threw the rope at me like a lasso, but I easily dodged it. I grabbed the end and yanked on it, trying to pull the hermit off balance. He yanked back, sending me stumbling forward.</p>
<p>I was too small to win in a tug of war match with the hermit; my only hope was to get him out in the open and use my speed to take him down. I waited for him to yank on the rope again, and I let go. The hermit lost his balance and fell backwards crashing into a bundle of black rubber hoses running this way and that between pipes.</p>
<p>I darted out the door back into the forest. I hoped the hermit wouldn’t have time to start the switch on the contraption had had Nora strapped into before he came after me.</p>
<p>He didn’t. He stumbled out the door, the rope still in his hands. “Is the bottled water good?!” he asked, yelling now into the darkness.</p>
<p>“The bottled water’s over here. Come and find out!” I called, and I trotted off towards the edge of the clearing. The hermit limped along after me. His right leg seemed to be hurt, so he couldn’t move very fast.</p>
<p>At the edge of the clearing, I turned around suddenly and started racing at the hermit at full speed, even faster than I had run at the door. My feet were taking huge chunks of dirt out of the ground and kicking it off behind me with each stride. My legs felt as if they were going to tear apart. I ran, ran, ran, ran—</p>
<p>The hermit threw the rope at me, but I dodged it, and then I bounded into the air, my feet ahead of me. I felt my shoes sink into the hermit’s many layers of clothing, and this time, it wasn’t enough to protect him.</p>
<p>The hermit and I toppled to the ground in a pile, me on top, him on the bottom. I grabbed the end of the rope that was still in his hand, jumped up, and ran into the cabin.</p>
<p>Nora looked relieved to see that I had come back in instead of the hermit. I undid the leather strap around her mouth and got to work untying her. “I’m sorry!” she wailed. “He made it sound like he knew how to find the campsite, and I was scared of the spiders, and wasn’t thinking straight…”</p>
<p>“It’s all right,” I said as I pulled out the last knot. “By the way, about the spiders…”</p>
<p>“Is the bottled water good?!” the hermit yelled suddenly, appearing at the door with the other end of the rope in his hand. I tensed up, ready to take Nora in my arms and run, but I didn’t have to.</p>
<p>“Really, Zeke, attacking a pair of dear little girls like these two? You ought to be ashamed of yourself!” came an old lady’s voice from behind the hermit.</p>
<p>“Dreadful, dreadful,” scolded another.</p>
<p>The spiders had finally arrived.</p>
<p>“The bottled water is good!” the hermit yelled, jumping at the spiders. But he and I were holding two ends of the same rope. I yanked on my end, pulling him off balance. Then one of the spiders—I couldn’t tell if it was Doris or Phyllis—reared up like a stallion and came down on top of the hermit, pinning him to the ground.</p>
<p>The other spider began to pull a string of silk out of her…ah, maybe I’d better not say. If you know where it comes from, you might be too grossed out to wear clothes made from it. And then my parents might be mad at me for convincing them to sell the clothes that Doris and Phyllis make in our stores.</p>
<p>So let’s just say that she got a string of silk from somewhere. Then she wrapped it around the hermit’s middle, gumming him up so he couldn’t move his arms at all. Then she got another string of silk from somewhere and gummed up his legs.</p>
<p>I felt Nora’s hands on my back. She was hiding behind me, her eyes as wide as a full moon, staring at the spiders. “Yeah, about the spiders,” I said, smiling a little. “They’re not so bad. In fact, they only chased us because they wanted to sell us clothes.”</p>
<p>Nora threw her arms around me and buried her face in my shoulder. We’re about the same height, so she had to bend down to do it. “Thank you so much for saving me!” she said.</p>
<p>“Of course. We’re friends, aren’t we?” I said.</p>
<p>“A-are we?”</p>
<p>“We’re not?”</p>
<p>Nora shook her head. “No, of course we are! Um, you’re the second friend I’ve made at St. Galgani’s, after Lily.”</p>
<p>After the spiders had finished tying up the hermit, they walked us back to the campsite. I could tell that Nora was still nervous around them, and I couldn’t really blame her. Walking next to giant spiders is a little creepy, even when you know they won’t hurt you.</p>
<p>“You know, instead of thanking me for saving you,” I mentioned as we walked along behind the spiders, “you should be angry at me for getting us into this mess.”</p>
<p>“No, it wasn’t your fault, Ranta…I’m the one who dragged us over the cliff,” said Nora. I couldn’t see her face well, but I could hear the pine needles crunching under her hiking boots.</p>
<p>“Yes, but I’m the one who thought she could use a map and a compass, and really couldn’t. I’m sorry. I led us off into the forest, when really, we should have just stayed where we were and yelled for help.”</p>
<p>“No, you don’t need to apologize” said Nora. “I can’t be mad about that. We’re both safe, and we have a story to tell Lily and Francine when we get to the campsite.”</p>
<p>It took us about an hour to walk to the campsite. I knew we were there because we reached a ring of large trees that had obviously been planted on purpose to enclose a clearing, and I could see the light of campfires in the clearing. The spiders led us up to the edge of the ring of trees.</p>
<p>“Well, goodbye, dearies, and do try not to go off with old hermits in the future, there’s a good girl,” said one of them—Doris or Phyllis, I still couldn’t tell.</p>
<p>“Goodbye, Doris and Phyllis,” I said. “Thank you for your help. I’ll talk to my parents.”</p>
<p>“There’s a dear.”</p>
<p>With that, the spiders went off into the dark forest again, chattering amongst themselves in their high old woman voices. I led Nora into the ring of trees.</p>
<p>As we came into the light of the campfires, I saw her yawn. “I’m tired,” she said. “I can’t wait to get to bed.”</p>
<p>We found our group, camped out under an old fir tree. When we came up, Mrs. Julian, Lily, Francine, and Maria were still sitting around the fire, but the children had all been put to bed inside the tents.</p>
<p>Lily was the first to see us. “Nora! Ranta!” she cried out, and jumped to her feet, surprised and delighted to see us. She was so happy to see us that she seized Nora in a hug and then took me by the hands and spun me around in a quick and energetic waltz. “Thank goodness you’re here!”</p>
<p>We sat down around the fire, and Mrs. Julian cooked bacon and eggs and made tea for us on the campfire while Nora and I recounted what had happened.</p>
<p>When I came to the part about the giant spiders, Francine gasped in shock, but Maria said, “Come on, there’s no such thing as giant spiders.”</p>
<p>I was about to insist they were real, but Lily beat me to it. “Sure there is,” she said. “I’ve met some before. Bought some pajamas from them.”</p>
<p>“They sell pajamas?” said Maria, with a tone of disbelief.</p>
<p>“Sure, and their names were Doris and Phyllis,” said Lily.</p>
<p>“There’s no way you’re serious. Quit joking around,” said Maria.</p>
<p>All at once, Nora, Lily, and I started talking, insisting the spiders were real. “Fine, fine, the spiders are real,” said Maria after a few minutes, and I continued the story.</p>
<p>Then Nora told how she’d been taken captive by the hermit, and tied in a strange machine that the hermit had said would suck all the water out of her so he could taste it and find out whether it tasted good. “Okay, you almost had me with the spiders, but that’s just ridiculous,” said Maria. “A hermit who sucks the water out of you? Just stop. I think you two just wandered around the forest for a few hours and then decided it would be fun to tell us all a weird story about what happened.”</p>
<p>Nora and I both spoke at the same time again, insisting that wasn’t it, but Maria was having none of it this time. “Whatever. I’m going to bed. Great joke, you two, but I’m not falling for it.”</p>
<p>We finished the story, telling Francine, Lily, and Mrs. Julian about how I’d fought off the hermit, and how the spiders had come and tied him up and guided us to the campsite. When we’d finished, Lily clapped, and Francine joined her.</p>
<p>“Do you believe us, Mrs. Julian?” I asked, looking at her anxiously. I was worried that she would think the same as Maria, and punish us for running off and then telling lies.</p>
<p>Mrs. Julian smiled. “I’m glad you’re safe,” she said. “I think it’s time we all went bed. Lily, would you mind putting the food sack over against the tree? That way we won’t have any visits from bears or pine cats inside our tents.”</p>
<p>“We’d better finish this bacon,” I told Nora. “Pine cats love pork, so if there’s any left, they’ll be after it.”</p>
<p>After that, the rest of the trip passed uneventfully. The little kids ran around and screamed all day, while Maria yelled at them to stay in a group, and Mrs. Julian, Francine, and Lily studied the rock formations. Nora and I would listen to them talk about rocks until we couldn’t stand it anymore, and then we’d go off and enjoy the forest: the whisper of the breeze through the redwoods; the scent of the pines; the thick, white foam of the river as it crashed over the rocks. It was a beautiful place, and I decided that I wanted to come back sometime, with fewer people, and see it again.</p>
<p>After we got back to St. Galgani’s, I wrote my parents and asked if they would consider buying clothes from Doris and Phyllis, as I’d promised the spiders I would. But I didn’t think I could stand to wear the clothes myself, not after I’d seen where the silk came out of. I later asked Lily how she dealt with it when she wore the pajamas she’d bought from the spiders.</p>
<p>“It just doesn’t bother me,” she said.</p>
<p>“But surely you know where the silk comes from? What part of the spider makes the silk?” I said.</p>
<p>“Sure. It just doesn’t bother me,” she repeated.</p>
<p>That was the first sign I had that Lily is a little bit different. A little bit weird.</p>
<p>After all, it doesn’t bother her at all to wear clothes woven from silk that came out of a spider’s—eh, I’d better not say after all.</p>
