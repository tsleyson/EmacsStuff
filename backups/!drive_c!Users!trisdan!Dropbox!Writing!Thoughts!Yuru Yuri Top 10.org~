Since I never actually wrote down my thoughts about Yuru Yuri, I thought I would jot some notes down and also write down my top ten list.

I like the series now, so I'd like to disavow some of the mean things I said about it before. For one thing, I was totally wrong about the characters. Here are the various ways in which I was wrong about the characters:

Akari: I said she was like Yui (Hirasawa), which is wrong. She's sort of a ditz, but she's definitely not dynamic and energetic like Yui. She's actually more like Lucky Star's Tsukasa (in a lot of ways), but the manga makes more of a joke about her lack of presence. And she definitely gets meatier parts than Tsukasa ever did. Being Chinatsu's sex slave, for one thing.

Kyoko: I said she was like Ritsu, but that's wrong. She's more like Konata, but really she's not much like either of them. Kyoko is definitely more of a class clown type. This is unlike Ritsu, who's actually sensible and realistic, and just happens to be energetic and somewhat brash. This is also unlike Konata, who was always living in her own world. Kyoko seems to genuinely want to make others laugh, especially Yui (Funami). She's sort of like Yui's idiot friend that Yui keeps hanging out with for the laughs. Also, she's not really an aggressive lesbian, although the first episode makes it look that way. (She's actually sort of like Kirino, in that she's a magical girl otaku who's attracted to Chinatsu because Chinatsu looks like her favorite magical girl Mirakurun. But really, Kyoko's pursuit of Chinatsu is pretty mild.)

Yui: I said she was like Mio, which wasn't completely wrong, but really she's more Kagami, but without the tsundere-ness. She's sort of a slacker, wasting her potential in sports and instead sitting around playing video games and goofing off with Kyoko. She actually does enjoy hanging out with Kyoko, whereas Mio and Ritsu's relationship sometimes got so bad that they "broke up". Yui also gets some of her personality traits from the "princely" girl in shoujo yuri, like Strawberry Panic's Amano or the assumed personality of Rei in MariMite. (Maria-holic's Ryuken is a parody.) 

Chinatsu: I was most wrong about her; she basically changes personalities after the first episode, which Namori (the manga's author) even acknowledges in the panel-side notes. Chinatsu becomes a creepy obsessive stalker type, like OniAi's Akiko. Of course, since the title is Yuru /Yuri/, the object of her affections is Yui. She forces Akari, who's very naive and innocent, to "practice" kissing, dating, and lesbian sex with her. She has a bossy, queen-like, and arrogant personality.

Ayano and Chitose: I wrote that Chitose "fantasizes that her [Ayano's] clumsy attempts to be friends with Kyoko mean she's actually in lesbian love with Kyoko", but the manga later on confirms that Ayano is most certainly in lesbian love with Kyoko.

Himawari and Sakurako: I thought they were annoying, but now I know they're awesome. (Especially Himawari.)

I still think this is true: "The story is super thin, I mean so thin it makes K-On look like Game of Thrones." One of the things that made K-On more than just a moe yon-koma was the fact that the characters had to graduate and leave each other. I don't think Yuru Yuri will ever be more than a moe yon-koma. But it is one that I've come to really enjoy and appreciate, mostly for its adorableness and the characters. I can see why past me didn't really give it a second thought when Bakemonogatari was still going, even though I did think the second episode was pretty fun even at the time. 

I like that the two quartets (Amusement Club and Student Council) actually intermingle. We've had a few stories where Ayano and Chitose hang out with the Amusement Club; we've also had a few where the groups split along age lines, with second-years Kyoko, Yui, Ayano, and Chitose in one group, and first-years Akari, Chinatsu, Himawari, and Sakurako in another. All the girls have sisters (except for Yui, who does have a younger cousin, and Ayano and Kyoko, who are a only children) and we get some fun scenes with them too. There was also a chapter where Namori went out of his way to make unusual pairings come about by happenstance—Akari and Chitose meet by the road as Chitose is weeding, and Ayano and Chinatsu meet in a clothing shop and argue over whether clothes would look better on Yui or Kyoko, while Kyoko gives Himawari tips on picking study guides and Yui is amazed by Sakurako's ineptitude at cooking. Kyoko and Sakurako hang out a few times and really hit it off, both being clownish types; it turns out that Yui and Ayano enjoy each other's company; and Chitose narrowly avoids being the one to teach Akari about the birds and the bees. (Or I guess the birds and the birds, since it's all lesbian sex.)

This is just going to be my thoughts on Yuru Yuri, since I didn't make a regular file. I watched some more of the anime (through Episode 6, and also Episodes 2 and 3 of Season 2, which I watched by mistake, but since this is Yuru Yuri, there was no plot to spoil, and I didn't even notice until I had already watched them that they were under the Season 2 banner.

The anime actually added quite a bit of original material to the later parts; I think this is good, because the manga did leave a lot of topics unexplored. It also fleshed out some scenes that happened or were mentioned in the manga. Episode 5 (titled "When Akari and the Cicadas Cry", makes sense after watching it) shows Kyouko's trip to Comiket with Ayano, Chitose, and Yui, which was mentioned in the manga later, when Kyouko brings Akari and Chinatsu. (In Episode 5, she says she would feel bad about traumatizing them when Ayano demands to know why she was brought instead of them.) Kyouko makes everyone dress in cosplay of various Mirakurun characters and takes the lead role herself. She says Ayano looks cute in the skimpy Rivalrun costume, which causes Chitose to get a nosebleed even though at the time Chitose is somewhere else in the hall discovering yuri doujinshi. 

Meanwhile, Akari and Chinatsu are hanging out at Chinatsu's house; unbeknownst to Akari, Chinatsu is looking down on her and is mad she can't see Yui and is stuck with Akari. (Poor Akari suffers a lot more in the anime—for instance, every episode begins with her trying to do an old-fashioned intro where she appears and says "Yuru yuri—hajimaru yo!" like in Nanoha and lots of older shows. But something terrible always happens to her—a UFO crashes on her, the camera goes out of focus, or Kyouko hijacks her part while wearing an awful mask.)

This leads into the scene where Chinatsu forcibly kisses Akari, which is even more terrible for poor Akari than in the manga. Akari actually runs away from Chinatsu, crying out for help; Chinatsu chases her all over the house, saying evil lines like "There's no one here to save you!". Chinatsu finally catches her in the entryway and overpowers her, pushes her down, and forcibly kisses her. It looks even more like lesbian rape than in the manga. Then Yui and Kyouko come in and unknowingly rescue Akari, but poor Akari is insensate on the ground with dead eyes and tears running down her cheeks. 

Unlike the manga, though, Akari is not Chinatsu's sole victim. In the next episode, Kyouko draws a doujinshi about her and Yui falling in love. (She is inspired somehow by an event which happens in the beginning of the spinoff manga Reset!—a first-year student named Takaoka Hiro finds one of Kyouko's drawings on the floor, and is seen holding it by another student named Isurugi Aoi, who enlists Hiro to do art for her doujin game. Hiro returns the drawing to Kyouko and tries to get Kyouko to do the game art for Aoi, but in both versions Kyouko gets out of it (in the Yuru Yuri anime, she gives the hapless Hiro some vague advice about how to get good at drawing, then gets dragged off by Yui to do some classroom duties; in the Reset! manga, she blows off Hiro with some words of encouragement and runs away)). 

Chinatsu, of course, is angry that Kyouko drew such a story about Yui, so she takes on Kyouko's challenge to draw her own story. She does it as a picture drama. Kyouko thinks the title is pretty cool, but it soon transpires that Chinatsu is awful at art (this is the first time I've actually seen her art; in the manga and elsewhere in the anime, it's pixellated because it's so awful). Chinatsu's art looks like a combination of Picasso, abstract impressionism, goth, and kindergarten; she uses blotchy black backgrounds in every picture and then fingerpaints abstract shapes on top of it, which can vaguely be recognized as representing herself and Yui. Yui, Akari, and (yes, even) Kyouko are so horrified that they become nauseous and are willing to do anything to stop it. Yui finally hugs Chinatsu and tells her she was happy to see it, and Kyouko admits defeat. Kyoko then pulls out a box of clay and says they should build things out of clay; Chinatsu wants to finish presenting her story, but everyone else pushes until she agrees to play with clay. 

Kyoko makes Mirakurun / Chinatsu with her legs spread and her panties showing out of clay. Chinatsu gets angry, especially when Kyoko says she's going to keep it in her room; to appease her, Kyoko says she'll keep it in Yui's room, and Chinatsu says that's okay, because Yui is the only one she'll spread her legs for. A few days later, everyone goes over to Yui's house and meets Mari-chan, who believes that Chinatsu is Mirakurun. Kyoko dresses her up and makes her take Mari-chan for a walk as Mirakurun, but Chinatsu starts acting like a bitchy princess when Mari-chan is in the bathroom, and making Akari and Kyoko feed her while she lays around; Mari realizes it's not the real Mirakurun and is sad.

In the end, Akari wants to present a picture drama, but she put the pages in the wrong order, so she flips the first one and it says "The End". The episode then ends before Akari can reorder the pages. 

I liked the way the anime portrayed Chinatsu better than the manga's way. The manga sometimes needles her a little, but the anime really went full on, first showing her horrifically rape poor Akari, and then having everyone (even Yui) nauseous and horrified at her art and somewhat put off by the way she acts when she's pretending to be Mirakurun.  I think that's the proper reaction to Chinatsu; she is cute, no doubt about it, but her personality could use some work. Although unlike Sakurako, Chinatsu's sister Tomoko does like her. (The other spinoff manga, Oomuro-ke, brings some depth to the relationships between Sakurako and her sisters, but basically, they still think she's dumb and useless.)

Speaking of Sakurako, there was a great scene with her and Himawari in one of these episodes. Sakurako is over at Himawari's house getting help with her homework as always; she asks Himawari to give her answers to something, but Himawari won't. Sakurako goes into the other room and grabs Kaede-chan, bringing her back in and threatening to pull on her cheeks if Himawari doesn't help her. Himawari is angry at such an underhanded tactic, but Kaede-chan tells Himawari not to be angry; it's just this horrible educational system failing Sakurako and causing her rage. She then tells Sakurako she'll endure whatever Sakurako wants to do if it'll help her exercise her rage and impotence, and Sakurako lets Kaede-chan go.  

The voices in the anime are all really good. The casting is brilliant—almost the entire cast has never been in anything else, and it's as if they were born to play these parts. Minami Tsuda plays Akari with a perfect mixture of cuteness and dopiness; she sounds a little like Sakura Tange, although not quite as wet. Yuka Otsubo plays Kyoko with just the right mixture of brash, cute, and refined. Rumi Okubo's Chinatsu is super cute, although she manages to pull off evil as well. Yui's voice is as casual and boyish as you'd expect. Among the student council members, we have two actresses with other big parts to their names, Saki Fujita and Aki Toyosaki. Saki Fujita is perfect as Ayano, and Aki Toyosaki captures the right dorkiness for Chitose (who apparently has a Kansai accent). Himawari's and Sakurako's actresses are also excellent; Himawari's voice is mature and somewhat motherly-sounding, while Sakurako's is shrill and brash, but also manages cute when needed. I was amazed at how good they all are; everyone sounds like they were cast for the character, and not shoehorned in due to popularity. (I like how Aki Toyosaki plays so many different characters, and isn't always stuck with ditzes. She was good as Uiharu Kazari too, and she even played Medaka Kurokami, although I can't remember how it sounded.)

The manga translation and anime translation seem to have exactly compensated for each other's weaknesses. In the manga, Akari refers to herself in the third person. In the anime, she also does, but the subtitles don't replicate it. On the other hand, the manga did a pretty bad job with translating Ayano's placename-based puns (which, granted, are like impossible to translate); the anime at least tried, probably because Yui snorts every time Ayano does one, and it would be really weird if she were just laughing for no reason. For example, the anime has Ayano say she's "mad mad Madrid", which is probably about the level of what she said in Japanese, although I don't know what she said in Japanese.

Sometimes, when anime writers add things to the manga, they do little things that show they didn't quite grasp some subtlety of the character in the original manga. For example, in one of the K-On bonus episodes, Ritsu suggests doing a live show, and Mio votes against because of stage fright. Azusa votes against because Mio does. This shows that they didn't quite get Azusa, because she would never vote against doing a performance, and in general, she doesn't just follow Mio arbitrarily like the adoring kouhai in other shows. But from what I've seen so far, the Yuru Yuri writers totally understood the characters, in all their subtleties. In particular, they understand Kyoko. I would've expected them to not quite get that Kyoko acts silly so everyone can have fun and have her do something selfish or hurtful, but it seems like they understood this about Kyoko. Even her decision to bring Ayano to Comiket was considerate, if mistaken; Kyoko thought that Akari (who is innocent) and Chinatsu (who Kyoko mistakenly believes to be delicate) would be overwhelmed by Comiket, whereas she thought Ayano and Chitose were tough and would be able to take it. She was right in Chitose's case, but mistaken about Ayano. 

The writers also seem to really get Chinatsu, the other subtlety about Yuru Yuri, and see that she's a spoiled princess type, and even expand on the manga depiction by having her torment Kyoko and Yui more often. When I started watching the series, my perception (which I think Namori was aiming for at the time) was that Kyoko was the knowingly crazy character, Yui was the Oneesan character, Chinatsu was the cute-but-put-upon one, and Akari was the natural ditz. As the manga moved on, it seemed like Namori realized he had no idea how to do a natural ditz character, so he made Akari a good girl, and Chinatsu started moving in the direction of being a delusional manipulative creepy stalker type. The anime completed that by adding the spoiled princess elements to Chinatsu's personality to make her more consistent. 

** <2014-07-08 Tue>
Episodes 7 and 8 of Season 1 were a lot of fun, and added something interesting to Chinatsu's character. I almost feel like the anime writers knew how unsympathetic she was in the manga, so they added this to make her a little more likable. 

In Episode 7, Kyoko decides that since none of them have Christmas dates, they'll all draw numbers from a box and those with matching numbers will take each other on a Christmas date. She includes the Student Council. Of course, Kyoko wants Chinatsu, Chinatsu wants Yui, Ayano wants Kyoko (in a tsundere manner), and Himawari and Sakurako want anyone except each other (but specifically, Himawari wants Chinatsu and Sakurako wants Akari, which is nice for poor Akari, since someone wants her. Kyoko tells Himawari she can't have Chinatsu, though). The end results are quite a bit like one of the manga's many "mismatched pairings" chapters. Yui and Ayano pair up and feel so awkward that they just sit on a bench near where the group met up the whole time. Towards the end, they connect a little when Yui talks about how much of a pain Kyoko is, and Ayano talks about what a pain Chitose is, but they agree that that's what makes things fun. Yui also laughs at Ayano's puns as usual. 

Himawari and Sakurako of course end up with each other, since they both wanted anyone else. They go to a restaurant and argue, but end up getting along and feeding each other things they don't like, although Himawari punches Sakurako when people in the restaurant talk about how cute they are feeding each other.

Akari ends up with Chitose. They go out for coffee and don't quite know what to do at first, but Chitose puts Akari at ease, telling her she doesn't have to speak respectfully, and gives Akari a box of her homemade takuan pickles as thanks for the box of tissues that Akari gave her when she and Ayano came to visit the Amusement Club. Akari thinks that Chitose is very cute in an old lady sort of way, and they go to one of Akari's favorite sweets shops. Akari follows Chitose's advice of eating pickles after anko to mix the sweet and salty flavors, and Chitose says it's a wonderful restaurant and thanks Akari for introducing her to it.

That leaves Kyoko with her desired companion, Chinatsu, who of course doesn't want to be there since she wanted Yui. Kyoko, in her somewhat thoughtless way, stocked a day full of things that she likes. First they go to a theater to see Mirakurun: The Movie, which Kyoko has already seen, but she says she wants to see Mirakurun watching Mirakurun. Chinatsu is unhappy at first and dodges all of Kyoko's attempts to hold her hand or put an arm around her shoulders in the dark, but she gets into the movie towards the end. Afterwards, Kyoko drags her to the arcade, but on the way sees Chinatsu eyeing a stuffed animal in a crane game and leaves Chinatsu for a minute to win it for her. Chinatsu is actually touched. On their way somewhere else, Kyoko asks Chinatsu if she can hold her hand, and Chinatsu says just for that day.

All the plotlines here were adorable (and I always liked the pairing of Akari and Chitose in the manga), but the Kyoko/Chinatsu plot made me think a little better of Chinatsu. Even though she's a spoiled princess, she's not a complete bitch; she allowed herself to have fun, even though it was with Kyoko instead of Yui (she probably would have preferred Himawari or Akari to Kyoko, too), and recognized that Kyoko had her good traits too. 

The next episode introduces Chitose's twin, Chizuru, and shows us how she and Kyoko met and a little more of why she dislikes Kyoko. (I kind of have a feeling that some of these plots originated in the anime and were backported to the manga, and the Kyoko/Chizuru plot is one of the prime suspects.) We also see how she acts around Chitose at home a little more. According to Chitose, she's like "a normal little sister" and does things like wash Chitose's back and climb into bed with her (they share a room, but their beds are huge), and we do see her doing all those things. I really liked the Chizuru and Kaede story from the manga, although I figure that falls below notability thresholds for the anime. 
* Top Ten
** 1. Himawari Furutani
I was surprised to find that she's my favorite. I guess she's the most Azu-nyan like of the Yuru Yuri characters in personality. She's also a bit like Mio, but without the shyness.  She's super adorable in appearance; I love her headband and little braids (the big braids early on weren't bad either, but the little braids are cuter). Even though her breasts are much bigger than anyone else's, her body is actually really nice and proportional. I liked when Akari, Sakurako, and Chinatsu spend a whole chapter trying to figure out how to drink tea in an elegant and ladylike manner, and Himawari walks in late and unconsciously just does it, to Sakurako's chagrin. She also reminded me of Kuroneko when she took care of her sister, Kaede. 

** 2. Ayano Sugiura
Mega-cute! I love her ponytail. I love how she gets embarrassed when she's trying to be friends with Kyoko, and how she keeps calling Kyoko "Toshinou Kyoko", even in weird contexts like saying "I wonder if this shirt would look good on Toshinou Kyoko?" Her relationship with Chitose is really cute too. In the anime, she's voiced by Saki Fujita, who voiced Mahiru Inami in Working!

** 3. Chitose Ikeda
She's also really cute, with her glasses and albino appearance, and the closest Yuru Yuri comes to having a story; it's never specified whether she's in love with Ayano herself and just such a good friend that she still helps Ayano hook up with Kyoko (as her twin sister Chizuru believes) or not. Also, she's voiced by Aki Toyosaki in the anime.  

** 4. Akari Akaza
First score for the Amusement Club! Finally, Akari overcame her lack of presence. Really, this is half because I feel sorry for her. She doesn't deserve to be so mistreated. Her dango hairstyle is cute, and she's a good girl. I liked when it was revealed that she had the power make others work hard to get into her good graces by saying she hates them, causing them such shock at the thought of being hated by a good girl like Akari that they'll do whatever's necessary to earn her like. (It works on Kyoko, Yui, and Chinatsu, anyway—and Chinatsu is pretty hard to budge most of the time.)

** 5. Kyoko Toshinou
I usually don't like crazy characters in yon-koma, and I did choose serious characters for my top four. But Kyoko clicked with me in a way that crazy characters often don't. I think because you can tell that she's acting clownish so everyone can have a good time, which I identify with. It makes her easier to like than the usual crazy characters who do weird things because they're oblivious or can't control themselves, and cause trouble for the serious characters. (This theme will reappear when we speak of Chinatsu below.) If you look at her, she actually has sort of an elegant, upper-class appearance, and her first name, Kyoko, sounds kind of old-fashioned and classy. I like how this contrasts with her personality. I also thought it was adorable how she used to be a crybaby and scaredy-cat and Akari was the dependable one. Her voice actress, Yuka Otsubo, also voiced Tamao Kurei in Haiyore! Nyaruko-san.

** 6. Yui Funami
I like Yui, but she's kind of low key and doesn't get as many moments. She does get a few, though—when she hangs out with Ayano and they trade puns, all the while thinking the other is put out; when Kyoko refuses to work unless Yui says she loves her, and Yui immediately says it; and when Yui and Kyoko have to switch roles, with Yui becoming the boke and Kyoko the tsukkomi. Kyoko's sickbed visit to Yui was also great, both for Yui and for Kyoko. Kyoko really did it, acting nurturing and gently uplifting so Yui could recover, but also throwing in enough jokes to keep Yui entertained. 

** 7. Sakurako Oomuro
Can be pretty funny, especially when she's with Kyoko, and definitely cute. But she doesn't show it enough, usually just provoking Himawari. The first time I really liked her was way late in the manga, when she goes with Kyoko to win a set of pajamas for her little sister Hanako. (I also liked when she sends crazy text messages to Chinatsu while posing as Akari, but she's an amateur compared to Rika Shiguma.) I did really like her sisters, and I thought it was funny that they both dislike her and find her stupid, lazy, useless, and annoying (both the older one, eighteen-year-old Nadeshiko, and the younger one, eight-year-old Hanako). 

** 8. The President
I don't think they ever mention her name in the manga. In the anime she's Rise Matsumoto. She's very quiet and her presence usually goes unnoticed. She's very cute, too. She only appears in one chapter. The only third-year of the bunch. In the anime, she speaks, but no noise comes out.

** 9. Chinatsu Yoshikawa
Chinatsu is one of those characters who definitely creates funny situations, but because the way she does it is selfish and destructive towards innocent bystanders, it can be hard to like her—the exact opposite of Kyoko, who might go too far sometimes, but always seems to be trying to make things fun for everyone. I don't want to be too negative because Chinatsu really isn't that bad—not like Ore Imo's Kanako. It's just, I felt bad for poor Akari when she became the victim of Chinatsu's quixotic quest for Yui's heart. 

Chinatsu lives in her own little world where her art isn't awful and Yui is some kind of prince on a white horse drawn with bad shoujo art. During their fake date, Akari even asks "What kind of person do you think Yui is?" when Chinatsu asks her to lick some pasta sauce off her cheek, saying it's what Yui would do. Yui seems to tolerate her more than anything; at one point she and Akari are working on Kyoko's manga while the other two sleep, and after commenting that  it sure is quiet with both Kyoko and Chinatsu asleep, Yui adds that Chinatsu has a certain charm, as if she's searching for redeeming qualities. (I don't doubt Yui thinks Chinatsu has a certain charm, but Yui also seems bemused and sometimes annoyed with Chinatsu's over-the-top lovey-dovey behavior.) Akari responds that Chinatsu is nice—but also scary.

* By the way, I have my own ideas about which yuri couples would be the best:

** Akari should shack up with Chitose
Chitose can take on the role of mature seme to Akari's naif uke, and teach Akari all about lesbian sex.
** Kyoko should shack up with Sakurako
They get along so well. They even look alike. And they're both crazy characters with an elegant sort of look to them.
** Ayano should shack up with Himawari
They seem to have kind of a distant relationship—Ayano even calls Himawari "Furutani-san". As we see, and as Chitose remembers, Ayano is actually pretty shy, so their closeness can still build until they have lesbian sex.
** Yui should come out of the closet
She's straight.

Among the yuri couples in the actual series, I like Ayano and Kyoko the best. Akari and Kyoko are also really cute together, although there's usually no indication that there's any yuri between them. (When Akari adorably said "I love you, Kyoko", Kyoko thought that it wasn't fun at all because she wanted Chinatsu to say it.) Yui and Kyoko are also pretty good together. Himawari and Sakurako definitely have their moments in the anime, although not really in the manga, not that I could see. 

* Some of the girls are definitely lesbians, and others may or may not be. Here's the numbers:
** Akari: 30%
She's not really mentally old enough to have a sexual orientation, I think. So if we assume that in any random sample of the female population, the mean lesbian rate is 30%, we then fix Akari's chances of being a lesbian as no better than random chance.
** Kyoko: 65%
She'd be a great prize for a guy: a cute, elegant girl with a fun personality. But she's just a little too flirty with Yui and Chinatsu for me to believe she's not at least bi-curious. Plus, there was that joke she made about Yui raping her when they were kids. 
** Yui: 50%
Although Yui seems to be the target of several girls' affections, she could very well be straight. Maybe in Japan she's too butch and has to be a lesbian, but in the US, girls like Yui, who're athletic, have good senses of humor, and like video games, are in fashion among guys right now. My vote is that she's straight, though certainly she values her friendships with other girls, and is just too young to act much on it.
** Chinatsu: 55%
That number might seem weird, so let me explain. Not only is Chinatsu obsessed with Yui, she also does lesbian stuff with Akari. But...the qualities she ascribes to Yui as reasons for her love are almost all the same qualities that girls look for in men in shoujo manga. So it could be that her love for Yui is actually /independent/ of Yui's gender, like the creepy stalker version of the continuum hypothesis. I also think she likes Akari because Akari is biddable and won't disobey her commands. She does lesbian stuff with Akari because she's manipulative and Akari is there, and if Yui had been a cool, princely guy and Akari the mild-mannered best friend guy, things still would have turned out the same for Chinatsu. That's the theory behind that number. In the absence of that theory, I would have given Chinatsu 100%, though.
** Ayano: 85%
Ayano's a lesbian, I almost guarantee it. I think maybe her shyness has something to do with it.
** Chitose: 95%
Chitose is a lesbian, I almost almost guarantee it. She herself seems to have realized this, too, because she actively fantasizes about other girls having sex. 
** Himawari: 37%
I actually think Himawari is probably straight. She's definitely good-looking enough that guys will notice her. I don't see romantic love in her relationship with Sakurako. I think maybe she just doesn't care at the moment about romance. She seems pretty shocked when she hears Nadeshiko talking to her girlfriend about sleeping over, and not in a "Girls can do that with each other? Interesting..." way.
** Sakurako: 43%
Sakurako could go either way, but I don't see her and Himawari shacking up. I think she should shack up with Kyoko. All her grabbing of Himawari's breasts is too aggressive and jealous for me to see it as romantic. Her older sister, Nadeshiko, is a lesbian with a girlfriend, but all of Sakurako's desire for bigger breasts makes me think she might be straight. 

In the anime, Season 2, there's an episode that changes things a little with Sakurako. Chinatsu wants to make Yui a scarf for Valentine's Day, so she asks Himawari-chan to teach her to knit. Himawari spends all her free time for about a month helping Chinatsu instead of Sakurako. Sakurako tries getting homework help from Akari, but she doesn't like it (poor Akari!) and can't stop thinking about Himawari. She's totally jealous that Himawari is spending all her free time with Chinatsu instead of with her. Nothing in the manga ever made her look as much like a lesbian as this.

(In the end, Himawari has a scarf that she made to show Chinatsu, which she gives to Sakurako along with some chocolate. Sakurako is touched and cries, on the heels of an outburst where she yelled at Himawari that Himawari has to be around to help her, but quickly goes back to her usual complaining and ingratitude, bitching that the scarf is itchy. Chinatsu goes to give her scarf and chocolate to Yui, and of course the scarf is awful, since this is Chinatsu, who sucks at doing anything with her hands other than making tea. She gives Kyoko her practice chocolate, which Kyoko eats and proclaims to be good. This makes Yui think the chocolate is probably good, since Chinatsu says she wasn't really trying on the ones she gave Kyoko, but somehow, when she tried harder, it made it worse.)  

 That's not really that different from say, Aria, by the way. In Aria, our two confirmed instances of heterosexuality—Aika and Alicia—are actually problematic. Alicia certainly has a deep and abiding love for Akari, whether or not it's romantic—which it almost seems like, in Arietta. And in the anime, the sex of her betrothed (or the sex of her notional betrothed that she hasn't met yet, depending on how you interpret her words) is never mentioned, so it could be female. Aika does have her little crush with Al going on, but Al is far from a manly man, and Aika spent years prior to that having a lesbian crush on Alicia. So the Aria numbers would be like this:

*** Akari: 67%
Akari definitely makes friends with men, but she never shows the slightest interest in deepening her relationships with them. On the other hand, she's very interested in deepening her relationships with other girls—especially Alicia, Alice, and Ai.
*** Aika: 60%
My vote would go for bi, in Aika's case. 
*** Alice: 75%
She has a thing for Akari, but she also gets in a huff when Athena can't go on a picnic with her as scheduled. Those girls ask her for her second button at her middle school graduation, too.
*** Alicia: 55%
It goes higher than 50/50 because of Arietta. We clearly see Alicia not being interested in Aika's advances, but she's just as clearly never interested in Akatsuki's. I think she probably just likes a better class of guy than Akatsuki, though, if she's straight, and she probably knew Aika would grow out of it.
*** Akira: 80%
Some things about her are surprisingly ladylike, such as her heels and the way she eats pizza in the manga (she's much more messy about it in the anime). But I think she's a lesbian. I don't, however, think she's in love with any of the main cast—though she's definitely jealous of Aika's love for Alicia.
*** Athena: 78%
 Her love for Alice and for her two old friends is just a little too intense for me to believe it's totally unromantic.
