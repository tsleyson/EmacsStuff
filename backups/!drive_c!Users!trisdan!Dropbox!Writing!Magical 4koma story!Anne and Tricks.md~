Anne and Tricks
===============
How are you? I’m Anne.

You probably know a little bit about me, although you might not know that you know it, because my full name is Anne Hanover, and I grew up to be Nora and Cora’s teacher and the advisor to Lily’s club. The story I’m going to tell you took place a long time ago, before Nora and Cora were born. I’d never tell them this story. It would ruin Nora’s image of me as a kind adult. I’ve told Lily a few stories about what I was like back then, but this story...no. They can’t hear it.

It happened when I was in eighth grade. I was fourteen; as cute as a button, as honest as a used car salesman, as kind as a Mongol warlord, and as caring as the stepmother from “The Juniper Tree”. From the tops of my ears to the tip of my tail, I was every bit a liar, cheater, and con artist; and I was proud of myself. How clever I thought I was.

I had a lot of fun in seventh grade. I lived in Cruess Hall, the same dormitory where Lily lives now. Unlike Lily, I had lots of friends there. My roommate was Bridget, my best friend. Our next-door neighbors were Karina and Zoe, who were also my friends. We used to stay up late every weekend and drink soda and eat junk food and talk. I got us some camping lanterns with fluorescent bulbs so we could have lights without being seen by the dorm monitor. On Friday night, someone would go to the store and buy the snacks and soda, and we’d set the lanterns on the bed and stay up all night and talk and laugh. Sometimes other girls from the dormitory would join us.

My Gift is the Gift of Trickery, and I used it all the time back then. Small lie or big, short con or long, I’d tell any lie I felt like and work any con I felt like, and then I’d tell Bridget and Karina and Zoe all about it later. Karina and Zoe would always giggle as I told them how I’d pulled it off. Bridget’s lips would pucker with distaste, and she would tell me how wrong I was, and if I’d taken anything, she would make me give it back. 

One Monday morning, the dorm monitor caught me in the hall as I was going to breakfast. She was headed for the laundry room, with a big stack of towels in her arms. “That sounded like some party last night,” she said.

“What do you mean?” I asked innocently.

“I heard you and your friends last night.”

“Really? We were asleep by ten. That couldn’t have been us, Miss DePalma.”

“I definitely heard laughing and voices.”

“I think it must have been the wind.”

“The wind doesn’t sound like that.”

“Maybe owls, then.”

“I also saw light from under the door.”

“That was moonlight,” I said. “The bright moonlight and all the noise from the wind and the owls woke up me and Bridget a couple times.”

“Uh huh.”

I could tell she wasn’t buying it, so I said, “Let me carry those towels for you, Miss DePalma. They look heavy.”

“Good girl. Well, tell those owls to keep it down. We don’t want the whole wing awake.”

“Certainly not,” I said, taking the stack of towels and wondering if she was trying to make some kind of owl pun by using the word “wing” here.

“Good girl. I’m heading out to town. If there’s any trouble here, I don’t want to hear about it.”

That was my biggest secret: I dressed like a good girl and I had good grades and I knew when to suck up a little. So I never got in real trouble with teachers or the dorm monitors. After all, I looked like such a good girl, in my long skirts and long-sleeved blouses, a big Alice bow on the back of my head. Not only that, I had good grades! As far as the teachers were concerned, I had to be a good person. If they started to doubt that, I just sucked up a little and convinced them.

Whenever I was short on pocket money, I’d run some kind of game and fleece the other girls. At first it was Scrabble. I was a good speller, so I could win money honestly like that. But pretty soon, no one would play with me for stakes because they knew I would win. So I started running games of chance. The dorm had an old, battered collection of board games. No one really played them because they all had pieces missing. I collected buttons and pebbles to stand in for the missing pieces, and I ran Monopoly, backgammon, chess, even Candyland. Of course, I made sure to lose enough that no one ever got suspicious. But I never really lost. When a night of gaming was over, I always had more money and meal tickets than I’d started with.

I once won five dollars from Priscilla Morgan, one of the chess club’s best players.

“You played well, Anne,” she conceded after I’d won. “I had my doubts at first, but you really did.”

“Thanks. So did you, Priscilla,” I said, graciously accepting the five dollars she laid in my hand.

“It was just so unexpected. I feel foolish for making a mistake like that. I thought I could checkmate you, but I just totally overlooked that pawn.”

“Maybe you underestimated me a little bit,” I said, tucking the five-dollar bill into my skirt pocket. “That’s okay, I don’t blame you. You’re really good. If you’d been playing your best, I don’t think I’d ever have won.”

The truth was, Priscilla hadn’t overlooked or underestimated anything. That pawn had been sitting next to the board, among the captured pieces. Then Priscilla had taken off her glasses to wipe them, and when she put them back on, that pawn was back on the board, right in the way of her checkmate.

I have no idea how it got there.

Seriously, I didn’t spirit it back onto the board or anything.

Another girl called Patricia thought she was really something at cards. She brought a deck to my game night and suggested having a poker game. Since we were all getting pretty tired of Monopoly, we went along with her.

“My daddy brought me to a real casino and let me play blackjack and poker with him,” she bragged as she shuffled the deck of cards. “So don’t get mad when I beat you all. That’s just the difference between someone who’s really played poker and someone who’s only played for buttons.”

My ears pricked up at this, both fox and human. I loved braggarts. They were so satisfying to beat. Patricia did know how to shuffle pretty well, but there was more to winning a card game than shuffling. “You’re right,” I said, slumping my shoulders a little to make myself look smaller and weaker. “Just by seeing how you shuffle the cards, I can tell you’re really good.”

“You might be good,” said another girl called Kristen, “but Anne’s like, crazy-lucky.”

“Skill will always beat luck,” Patricia sniffed as she began to deal the cards.

After two hours, Patricia had somehow lost every cent on her. “You—you all cheated!” she squealed.

“Who cheated?” I asked innocently.

“All of you! You’ve all got—aces up your sleeves or something!”

We all pulled back our sleeves to show her there was nothing up them. “Probably just a spot of bad luck,” I said. “It happens to all of us.” Turning to the other girls, I said, “Why don’t we play one more hand and then call it a night?”

The others agreed. As we all put in our wagers, Patricia stood up and started taking off her socks. They were knee socks with purple and black stripes. She tossed them into the pot.

“Those socks were seventeen dollars,” she said. “That should be enough to buy me in so I can win back my money, right?”

“I dunno, socks aren’t really—” Kristen started to say, but I interrupted.

“No, let’s let her,” I said. “We can’t take all her money and then keep playing without giving her a chance to win it back. That would be cruel.”

We all finished our wagers, finished drawing new cards, and prepared to show our hands. I laid my cards face-down on the table and ran my hand back through my hair to get it off my neck. As I did, I retrieved the queen of hearts I’d hidden inside my hair, wedged between my ear and my ribbon, and slipped it up the sleeve of my blouse. When I picked up my cards again, I swapped it for a useless two of clubs, which gave me four of a kind.

“All right, show ‘em!” Patricia yelled, and we all showed our hands.

Patricia’s socks fit me perfectly, by the way.

Another time, in the lounge, I overheard two girls called Evie and Rachel talking about which boys they liked, while flipping through a book called *Love Spells that Always Work! Guaranteed to Get You and Your Crush Together!*. Evie had a crush on a boy named Camden, so she and Rachel were looking for some kind of magical sign that they were meant to be.

“Oh, your signs don’t match,” said Rachel. “Camden’s a Scorpio. You’re a Libra.”

Evie and Rachel were both spoiled rich girls whose parents would do anything for them, and a sudden idea came to me. “Hi,” I said, approaching them with a big smile.

“Oh, hi Anne,” said Evie.

“I couldn’t help overhearing what you were saying about zodiac signs,” I said.

“Yeah, me and Camden don’t match,” Evie sighed.

“Anne, you’re pretty smart,” said Rachel. “Can’t you think of some way to get them together?”

“Actually, I do know a way,” I said. “But you’ll need your parents’ help.”

“My parents? Why?” asked Evie.

“Well, you know how zodiac signs get assigned, right? It’s your date of birth. So if you can get your parents to change your date of birth, your sign will change too.”

“How do they do that?” asked Evie.

“It’s on your birth certificate. If they hire a lawyer, they can get your birth certificate changed. That’ll change your date of birth, and your zodiac sign.”

For the next two months, Evie called her parents almost every day and begged them to hire a lawyer and change her date of birth. They must have told her that zodiac signs were stupid, but that just seemed to make her more obstinate. Clearly, Evie wasn’t used to being told “no” by her parents.

It went on for so long that I started to feel a little sorry for Evie’s parents, so I caught her one day and told her, “You know, having the same sign as your crush is good, but it’s even better if your signs are right next to each other. Like Libra and Scorpio. So I think you should ask Camden out. The stars are shining on your match, after all.”

The next day, Evie stopped bothering her parents and asked Camden out. She broke up with him three months later because he didn’t appreciate her for her brains.

So that was seventh grade. I had a lot of fun.

Eighth grade wasn’t so fun. At the start of the year, a new student transferred in. Her name was Jessica.

Jessica started out with no friends. Within a week, she had a gang of some kind surrounding her, but I don't know if I'd call them friends. They were more like a court. There were jesters, who made Jessica laugh when they talked about what clothes and TV shows they liked. There were courtiers, who copied everything Jessica did, until she made fun of them because they hadn't copied the new thing she'd just started doing that morning. There were knights, girls who would do chores and homework for Jessica, and in return, they were allowed to be part of the gang. And there was the nobility, duchesses and countesses who were high-ranking enough that they were allowed to laugh at the jesters and mock the courtiers and send the knights on quests to buy drinks or finish homework, just like Jessica did. 

At first, I didn't pay any attention to Jessica. I was still having fun with my friends, and I didn't really care what the new girl was doing. I'd trick her if I saw the chance, and otherwise I'd just ignore her. Speaking of people I’d tricked, Evie and Rachel had joined Jessica's court right away. Evie was a knight. She would get sent out to buy drinks and snacks for Jessica, or to sit in the baths and save a tub for Jessica, or show up for assemblies early and save her a seat. Every few weeks, one of the nobles would kick Evie out of the group, and she'd spend a few days moping around with her head down on the desk all through class, until she was allowed back in because someone needed her to buy snacks or save a seat.  Rachel was a duchess; she got to laugh and mock.

One Sunday, I decided to go sit in the lounge and read. Mrs. DePalma had left out a bowl of fruit for us, so I went and picked out a tangerine, and then found a seat in the corner with my book. I was reading the memoir of Richard Feynman, *Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman*. He was a scientist, which I didn’t care about, but he was also a wise guy, which I admired. He once broke into his boss’s safe, just for fun.

Jessica was across the room with her gang, laughing and talking, but I ignored them and read my book and ate my tangerine. I’d been reading for about twenty minutes when Evie came into the lounge and went to join Jessica’s gang.

“Oh...Evie,” said Jessica. “What *are* you wearing?”

“Uh...” Evie looked down at her pink T-shirt with red hearts in a circle over her chest, and her pink jeans with heart-shaped pockets. “Just jeans and a T-shirt.”

“Just *pink* jeans,” said Jessica. “With *hearts*.”

One of Jessica’s nobles, Gretchen, piped up. “Did you wear your My Little Pony panties today, too?”

Evie’s face turned bright red, as red as the hearts on her shirt, and she pulled down the hem as if she were afraid her panties might actually be poking out. “No, I...Th-this was clean, and I had to do laundry, but I didn’t get a chance...”

“It’s not My Little Pony,” said Rachel. “Evie wears Winnie the Pooh.”

Gretchen and several other girls burst out laughing. Jessica didn’t laugh, but she did smile while Evie’s face became more and more like a tomato, and she squirmed and pulled down her shirt hem and adjusted her waistband. When they were done, they turned away from Evie and started talking, completely ignoring her. When she couldn’t take it anymore, Evie crept away from the group and ended up on a sofa about ten feet from my chair, with her back facing me, her head down between her arms and her face hidden.

I got up to throw out my tangerine peel, and as I passed Evie, I stopped. “Why do you let them do it?” I asked. “Why does Rachel let them do it?”

Evie looked down at her fingers. “Rachel’s my best friend,” she mumbled.

“It looks like no one’s told her,” I said, but Evie turned away and wouldn’t talk to me anymore. I tossed my peels, grabbed another tangerine from the basket on the table against the wall, and headed back to my room, unable to stomach the atmosphere in the lounge.

Bridget was sitting cross-legged on her bed, leaned over the big book open in front of her. Her glasses kept slipping down her nose as she read, and she would reach up robotically to slide them back up. I glimpsed upside-down pictures of dolphins and narwhals as I crossed the room.

I sat down at my desk and watched her for a minute. First Bridget would push the glasses up, and they would be perfectly stable. Then the sliding would start: just a little at first. Bridget would ignore it as long as she could, until the glasses were dangling on the tip of her nose. Finally, just as they were about to fall, she would push them up, and the cycle would start again.

“Tangerine?” I asked, but Bridget shook her head without looking up from her book. I shrugged and started to peel it. “What do you think of the new girl?” I asked, as Bridget turned the page.

“New girl?” Bridget asked, her eyes fixed on the book.

“Jessica.”

“Trouble.”

I bit into the first slice of the tangerine. The first one, sweet and juicy as it was, had tricked me into taking another one. This one didn’t taste good at all. It was woody and a little green. “Trouble for who? Surely not for you. After all, you’ve got me, your own personal Robin Hood. Complete with fox ears and tail. Make me a bow and arrow and a little green hat.”

“Not for me,” said Bridget. “For Karina and Zoe. For you.”

“Surely you’re joking, Miss Bridget,” I laughed. “I’m the tricksiest trickster in the academy. No one’s going to get the better of me. I’m hurt that you think so. Apologize right now.”

This finally got Bridget to look away from her book. “We have tangerines?”

“I asked if you wanted it. You said no.”

“You know I never listen to you! Why didn’t you make me listen?”

“Well, do you want the rest?” I offered her the part I hadn’t eaten yet.

Bridget took it, pulled off a slice, chewed it thoughtfully. “What I mean is,” she said, then stopped to swallow the tangerine slice. “What I mean is, Karina and Zoe start fights. They start fights they can’t finish, because they think you’ll protect them. They *do* think of you as their personal Robin Hood.”

“Stop it, you’re embarassing me, making me sound so cool.”

“No, you—never mind. Why are you suddenly interested in the new girl?”

I shrugged. I used to do a lot of that. I used to pretend I didn’t care about things, even when I did. “I saw her gang being horrible to Evie.”

“Like you were when you got Evie to bug her parents so they would change her birth certificate?”

“No! That was just good-natured fun.”

“Or when you told Evie that soul music and soul food come from Seoul, Korea, and she included that in her report on Korean culture?”

“That was an honest mistake.”

“Or when Evie said ‘I don’t know if I should listen to you anymore, Anne...I kinda got an F on my report because of you, and my parents are pretty mad’, and you said ‘It was an honest mistake, Evie. Please forgive me.’”

“In each of those cases, not only was I forgiven, but Evie learned something, and grew up a little that day,” I said, shrugging. “That’s what I do. I help people grow up. I was lucky enough to grow up early, both my brain and my body—” I proudly thrust out my chest, which was very well developed for my age, “—so I’ve decided to help those who weren’t so lucky to grow up a little more every day.”

“You prey on the gullible,” said Bridget. “You’re despicable.”

“Well, if I’m so despicable, why are you friends with me?”

“You know when the Goths ran away from the Huns and decided to get protection from the Roman Empire, even though the Romans had been killing them for a hundred years? That’s why I’m friends with you.”

“Don’t be so hard on yourself. I forgive you for the hundred years you spent killing me.”

“No, you’re the Romans here, and I’m the Goths.”

I smiled vacantly at her for a second. “I’ve never seen you wear black lipstick or white face paint,” I said.

Bridget sighed. “Really, I know there’s a good person in there somewhere. And who else in this dormitory would have understood what I just said about the Goths? That’s why I’m friends with you. But seriously, Anne, I don’t know why you can’t just leave it alone. You’ve always been like this. You’ve always gone out of your way to look for trouble. I’m telling you not to do that. I’m telling you it’s not worth it.”

I leaned back in my desk chair, my tail flicking casually from side to side. I thought about what Bridget had said. The last part was true, at least. I couldn’t just sit around and read all the time like her. I liked to read, but I’d go crazy if I didn’t have some kind of excitement in my life, and reading wasn’t exciting.

I didn’t know why she was complaining, though. Some of the best times we ever had only happened because I was out looking for something exciting to do and things got a little hairy. Heck, we wouldn’t have even met Karina and Zoe if I wasn’t like that, because they’d be worm food.

It was during fifth grade. Our class was on a trip to town. We were inside a big store with clothes and groceries and car parts and all sorts of other things. Most of the class was off looking at clothes with the teacher and the other chaperones, but I wasn’t in the mood for clothes shopping, so I’d wandered off to the toy section.

In the toy section, I’d found two girls from my class that I just barely recognized—Karina and Zoe—talking to some strange man. He was tall, hairy, hadn’t shaved in a few days, and he was sweaty, because it was late spring and he was wearing a scarf, a ski hat, and a big coat like it was the dead of winter. He looked like a sweaty, half-shaved chimpanzee in an overcoat and dark glasses. If it were me, I wouldn’t have gone near him with a ten-foot pole, but these two ditzes were talking to him.

“Hey. would you help me look for my puppy?” he asked the two girls. “I lost him out in the parking lot when I took him for a walk.”

The two girls stared at each other, and then stared shyly at the chimp’s broad smile. “Well...I guess we could,” said Karina. “But...we gotta ask the teacher first.”

“Oh, it won’t take long,” said the chimp in the overcoat. “Just a few minutes. Your teacher won’t even notice you’re gone.”

I came around the end of the aisle, stomping my feet so the chimp and the two girls would pay attention to me. “Hey, I want to help too,” I said. “Me and puppies are sorta cousins, you know, since I’m a fox.”

“You do? G-great! We’ll go out there and find him right now,” said the chimp.

“Wait. First we hafta ask you some questions to make sure you’re pure and true,” I said. “If you’re not pure and true, we can’t help you.”

Karina and Zoe stared at me with blank eyes, like a couple of sheep. A couple of lambs to the slaughter. In need of a fox to save them.

The chimp was so eager to get us out to the parking lot that he nodded five times, and added a few jitters as a special bonus. “Okay. But I’m pure and true, I promise.”

“We’ll see. So, first question: what’s your name?”

“My name? Uh...”

“If you’re pure and true, you won’t have any problem telling us your name,” I said.

“My name is...uh...My name is Ray.”

“And your last name?”

“My last name is...uh...”

“You forgot your last name? No wonder you lost your puppy.”

The chimp looked annoyed, like I’d asked him to give me the decimal expansion of the square root of two out to fifteen digits, or something. “Greenblatt. I’m Ray Greenblatt.”

“Okay. Next question: what’s your puppy’s name?”

Another spasm of annoyance twisted the chimp’s face. “J...J...S...J...Jackson. That’s his name. Jackson”

“Okay, you pass. Next question: are you planning to lock us in your car and drive off somewhere where we’ll never be seen again, and lock us in your basement, and do horrible things to us until we die, and then you’ll feed us to the rats and maggots so no one ever finds the evidence?”

“No! No, of course I’m not...er, I’ll look for the puppy on my own,” said the chimp. “You...You made me mad with your questions, fox girl, so I won’t let you see him when I find him.” He backed out of the aisle and scuttled off, trying not to run. “You won’t see...Jackson...even when I find him! You missed your chance!”

Once he was gone, the two sheep-like girls turned their vacant stares on me, and one of them said, “Wow, was he really going to lock us up and kill us?”

“Probably,” I said.

“What a mean thing to do after we helped him find his dog!” said the other one.

From that moment on, Karina and Zoe were my friends. There are some things you just can’t go through together without ending up friends, and almost getting killed by a creepy chimpanzee-like guy in an overcoat is one of them.

Back in the present, Bridget was watching my tail flick, like a cat following a metronome. “I know that flick,” she said. “Stop flicking it like that. That flick always means you’re about to go looking for trouble.”

“It does not,” I said.

“Seriously, stop it,” she said. “I’ll come over there and tie your tail to the chair if you don’t stop it.” Bridget finished the last slice of her tangerine. “By the way, that tangerine wasn’t very good.”

<br />

I tried to do what Bridget said and avoid trouble with Jessica, for her sake. She worried a lot. Someday she was going to go bald or get an ulcer from all that worrying. I didn’t want to make her worry. If I did, she would blame her baldness and her ulcer on me, and I couldn’t stand taking that blame, so I would have to trick her. And I didn’t want to trick her, because the first time I tricked her, she swore our friendship would be over if I ever did it again. Bridget was my friend before Karina and Zoe were. But before we were friends, we were enemies.

On the first day of fourth grade, as everyone was lining up in the hall outside our new classroom, I saw a girl, as plain as a block of tofu. Only three things about her stood out: her huge, thick glasses; her hair, which was almond brown, done up in braids, and so long it dangled around her calves; and the cute blue and white satin ribbon tied around her left braid. As soon as I saw that ribbon, I wanted it.

“Everybody, gather round!” I called. “While we’re waiting for our teacher to show up, I’ll put on a magic show for you!”

I moved to the middle of the hall. The other kids, bewildered, stayed against the wall where they were, but all eyes were on me. “Young lady!” I called, pointing at the girl with the braids and the ribbon with a huge, theatrical twist of my arm. “That ribbon! May I see it?”

“Er...I can’t really tie this myself,” the girl said. “I had to have Miss Wimpole tie it for me. If I take it off, I don’t think I’ll be able to get it back on.”

“That’s okay,” I said. “I’m a master of tying knots, bows, and ribbons. I’ll get it back on for you.”

Reluctantly, the girl untied her ribbon and handed it to me. I carefully inspected it. “Beautiful craftsmanship. Satin? No—silk.” Her parents were pretty dumb, to send an expensive silk ribbon like this to school with their daughter. Soon they would know just how dumb. “Now, pay attention everyone. I will make this beautiful ribbon—disappear!” I twisted the ribbon around my right hand, and with a quick flick, spirited it up my sleeve.

The other kids looked mildly interested at this. They moved in closer to see. “Didn’t you just pull it up your sleeve?” someone asked.

“Nothing up this sleeve,” I declared, pulling back the left sleeve of my sweatshirt. “And nothing up this sleeve,” I said, pulling up my right sleeve. Of course, as I pulled down my left sleeve, I moved the ribbon from my right sleeve to my left sleeve so it wasn’t there anymore when I pulled up my right sleeve.

“That’s cool,” said the plain girl. “Now please give me back my ribbon.”

“I’ve already given it back,” I said.

“Pretty sure you haven’t,” said the plain girl.

“Why don’t you check your left pocket?”

The plain girl dug in the left pocket of her denim skirt and came up with a red bandanna with white polka dots. She held it up and gave me an exasperated look. “Oh, excuse me,” I said. “My mistake, try your right pocket.”

The plain girl dug in her right pocket, and there was the blue and white silk ribbon. “Is that your ribbon?” I asked, as the other kids watched with mounting interest.

“Yes,” said the plain girl. “Now can you tie it back on?”

“Sure,” I said. I took the polka-dot bandanna and flicked it up my sleeve, then took the ribbon and twisted it around her braid. “Now how did this go again? Hm, I’m having a hard time remembering.” I fiddled with the ribbon, trying to get it tied again, until the teacher came and opened the door for all of us to go inside.

“Never mind,” said the plain girl, annoyed. She took the ribbon and shoved it down into the right pocket of her skirt.

Of course, that plain girl was Bridget, and she wasn’t happy at all when she checked her right pocket at the end of the day and found my polka-dot bandanna in place of her expensive silk ribbon. She came straight to me, holding out the bandanna with a fiery rage in her eyes. “What did you do with my ribbon?” she demanded.

“Nothing,” I said. “Is it missing?”

“Your stupid thing was in my pocket, and my ribbon is gone! I’m not stupid—you must have taken it,” she said.

“I didn’t take it,” I insisted.

“Fine,” said Bridget. “You say you didn’t take it, I say you did. Let’s settle this with a test of wits.”

“Okay, but I should warn you: I’m the wittiest girl in the fourth grade.”

“Then you’ve got nothing to be afraid of. All right, here’s how it’ll go. I’m going to ask you a riddle. If you tell me the answer by tomorrow morning, I’ll believe that you didn’t take my ribbon and leave you alone.”

“Okay,” I said, “What’s the riddle?”

“Wait. If you can’t answer it by tomorrow, and my ribbon just happens to appear on my desk, I won’t ask any more questions. But if you can’t answer it and that doesn’t happen, I’m telling everyone that you stole it.”

“Okay, but that ain’t gonna happen, ‘cause I haven’t met a riddle yet that I couldn’t solve. So what is it?”

“Here’s the riddle,” said Bridget. “What has a mouth but never speaks, likes climbing mountain peaks, has a brain but never thinks and a boat that never sinks, has a tail that never wags, and keeps all its stuff in linen bags?”

I thought about it for a minute, but there wasn’t an obvious answer. “It’s a little harder than I thought, but I’m sure I’ll have an answer by tomorrow,” I said.

I spent the entire afternoon in the library combing through books, trying to find the answer to that riddle. First I looked through all the riddle books trying to find it, but it wasn’t in any of them. That girl didn’t seem like a tricky type, but she did seem like the type who knew a lot of weird things that no one else did. If she didn’t read that riddle in a book, she probably made it up with some weird animal that no one except her had ever heard of in mind. I looked through books on weird birds and reptiles trying to find something that would fit. Nothing did. I looked at books on gemstones and geologic formations. I looked at books on hydrology and heteroscedasticity (whatever that is, I never did figure it out). I tried to figure it out with logic. I drew diagrams and charts on paper. Pretty soon my table was full of sketches, scratches, and scribbles, and also an idea for a cartoon about a crested macaque that solves mysteries with a group of teenagers.

Miss Wimpole, the dorm mother, came to the library at nine o’ clock and dragged me back to go to bed. When I complained that I had to figure out the answer to a riddle, she just said, “Yes, I heard about that. Remember, Anne, what goes around comes around.”

I lay awake in bed thinking about what the answer to the riddle could be. It was almost midnight when I finally drifted off to sleep.

The next morning, I had to admit that I was well and truly stumped. That tofu-looking girl had come up with some weird animal that I couldn’t find in any book. I had lost, and I had to give back the ribbon—not because I was afraid of her telling on me, but just as a sign of respect.

I waited until she appeared at the doorway of the classroom and walked up to her. “Well, I have to admit it,” I said. “You got me. I don’t know the answer to your riddle.”

“Okay. Where’s my ribbon?” Bridget asked.

“I didn’t take it.”

“Okay, let’s let Miss Wimpole and the principal decide.”

“I think maybe it was in your pocket this whole time. Check your left pocket.”

Bridget reached into the left pocket of her jean shorts and came up with my spotted bandanna again. She gritted her teeth. “Take your stupid thing!” she yelled, throwing the bandanna at me and going to stomp past me.

“Wait! Wait! Try your right pocket!” I said.

Bridget reached into her right pocket, and there was her beautiful silk ribbon. “Thanks,” she grumbled. “I’m going back to my room to put this somewhere safe.”

“Wait, before you go, I have to know—what was the answer to the riddle?” I asked.

“Darned if I know. I just made up the stupidest thing I could think of from the top of my head so you would never figure it out.”

I took Bridget’s hand in both of mine and fell to one knee, and looked up into her eyes, meeting her look of disgust with one of adoration. “Marry me.”

“Ew, gross! For one thing, we’re both girls! For another, you stole from me!”

“You’re right, we should get to know each other before we commit to marriage. Be my friend?”

Bridget gritted her teeth again. “I guess, maybe,” she grumbled. “But if you ever trick me again, that’s it. We’re not friends anymore. We’re never friends again.”

“Understood,” I said. “You are the one person I’ll never trick, ever.”

That was how Bridget and I became friends.
