CHILD NUTRITION DATABASE
(CN-D)

SYSTEM COMPONENTS

The data files described in this document are designed and developed for nutrient analysis for the USDA Child Nutrition Programs.

Eight files were released in the CN17 version.  The abbreviated file names are FDES, CTGNME, WGHT, NUTVAL, NUTDES, BUYGD, BYGDLNK, and DQC. The CTGNME file contains descriptions for food categories assigned to foods in the FDES and BUYGD files. The DQC file contains the results of the nutrient data quality control field used to identify the nutrient information available for each item. 


The file formats include the name of each field, followed by the type of field (N=numeric, A=alphanumeric, and D=date), the field length including decimals, and an * (asterisk) symbol to indicate that a field is indexed, followed by the field description.  The indexes are identified in this document to display the order of records within the Agricultural Research Service database system known as the National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR). The files described in SR are released in American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) format and, therefore, do not have indexes.  Fields without indexes are separated by caret symbols (^), except for alphanumeric fields, which are denoted by tilde (~) symbols.

Discontinued Items

Each release contains revisions made to information included in the previous CN-D files. The status field in the FDES, WEIGHTS, NUTVAL, BUYGD AND BYGDLNK files should be checked against the previous CN-D release since some records have been discontinued in these CN-D files. The records that were marked as discontinued in the previous CN-D release have been removed from this CN-D release.  Please be advised that all discontinued records indicated by status = "d" found in this CN-D release will be removed in the next CN-D release. 

Clarification of CN Database Items with Status of "d"

The status field of the CN-D is intended to notify developers and users of approved software programs that data, such as food items used in recipes and menus will no longer be included in the next release of the CN Database and to provide users with ample time to replace the data.  The status field shows which food items and other data, such as weights and measures, are active as designated by an "a" and which food items are being discontinued and designated by a "d".  The contractor managing the CN Database will not remove data marked with a "d" until the next release.  Software developers must ensure that software programs do not interfere with this alert mechanism intended to inform the end users when data will no longer be available.  The data marked with "d" should not be removed from the software program’s database until it is physically removed from the CN-D with the next release.  Ideally, software developers should have a system in the software program for alerting the user about foods marked with "d", such as a warning message or report.



Comments and Notes for CN17 Release

CN17 Release: A record with a date after 03/1/2012 in the “date_added” field is a new record in the CN17 release.  A record with a date after 03/1/2012 in the “last_modified” field and different from the date in the “date_added” field contains a revised value in one or more of its fields with the CN17 release. 

69 new USDA Foods (commodity foods) and 30 new recipes used in the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program were added to CN17.

192 existing USDA Foods (commodity foods) used in the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program were updated with revised commodity codes, and updated nutrient data, including the new Vitamin A(RAE) values if available.

In CN17, Vitamin A(RAE) has replaced Vitamin A(RE).  All Vitamin A(RE) values in CN17 have been marked as discontinued (d).  Vitamin A(RAE) values were added for all Standard Reference items and those Commodity Food and Recipe items where the data was available.

All 447 foods in the Standard Reference 25 ADD_FOODS file have been added to CN17 provided that they met the nutrient requirements.



CN CODING DATABASE

The CN CODING DATABASE contains information needed for coding foods and amounts in the analysis of menus and recipes.  This information includes the non-nutritive info about the food and unit of measure information for calculating conversions of measures and nutrient values.   For each food in the database, there is a food identification code (CN_Code also referred to as CN-D Number or CND#)), food category code, description of the food, set of measures (for most foods), and gram weights for those measures.  Product codes, manufacturer names, brand/label names and brand/label codes are also included, when provided by the manufacturer, for commercially prepared foods sold for use in Child Nutrition Programs.

The CN CODING DATABASE consists of three (3) files.  They are the FOOD DESCRIPTION, WEIGHTS, and FOOD CATEGORY NAME files.



FOOD DESCRIPTION (FDES) file contains both a complete description and an abbreviated description for each food item in the CN Database. For commercially prepared (brand) foods sold for use in Child Nutrition Programs, the product code or UPC code and manufacturer name, associated with the item, are listed.

CN NUTRIENT DATABASE

The CN NUTRIENT DATABASE consists of two files--NUTRIENT VALUES and NUTRIENT DESCRIPTION.

NUTRIENT VALUES (NUTVAL) file contains nutrient values for food items to be used in the nutrient analysis of menus and recipes in the Child Nutrition Programs.  Sources of data for this file include the USDA Nutrient Database for Standard Reference; nutrient calculations for standardized school lunch recipes; industry data for foods sold for school lunch or breakfast programs, and USDA [commodity] Foods.  All nutrient values are based on 100 grams (nutrients per 100 grams).  Additional value type codes have been added to the NUTVAL Table to describe the type of value for a nutrient.

Differentiating Between Data Containing Zeros and Missing Data

Nutrient data represented by a zero means that the food item was tested for that nutrient, but there was no significant amount of that nutrient found in the food.  For example, a value of zero for food energy (or calories) means that this food contains no calories.  Values of zero are not to be interpreted as missing values or blanks; they must remain zeros.

Please notify FNS if you find any food items with missing values or blanks for any of the required nutrients: food energy, sodium, and saturated fat.  Foods that do not provide values for these three required nutrients should not be included in the CN-D. 

In the case of the remaining nutrients, missing nutrient values may exist and are shown as blanks in the CN-D.  Blank nutrient values should not be interpreted as zeros.  Blank nutrient values should be interpreted and marked as missing values; for example, an asterisk with a footnote indicating that the nutrient value is missing.  Additionally, any nutrient total containing a missing value must also be marked as including missing nutrient data.  Use of a zero to represent a missing value is incorrect.  Zeros must only be used for true zero values

DATA QUALITY CONTROL (DQC).  This file contains the results of a data quality control check. This table is completed after the nutrient values for each food item are reviewed. A number is then placed in the Data Quality Control Field, based on the data present, indicating which nutrient fields contain values. This file is used by the Food and Nutrition Service for tracking purposes. It is important to note that each food item in the FDES file has sixteen nutrient (NUTVAL) records associated with it; however, the values for ash, moisture, or trans fat may be blank, thereby creating a need for this table. 

All items with a CN Code greater than or equal to 100000 are listed in this file.  All items with a CN Code less than 100000 have an implied DATA QUALITY CONTROL VALUE= 3 (15 nutrients).

CN4 Release: A record with a date after 7/07/1998 in the "date added" field is a new record in the CN4 release. A record with a date after 7/07/1998 in the "last modified" field contains a revised value in one or more of its fields with the CN4 release.

CN3 Release: A record with a date after 7/20/1995 in the "date added" field is a new record in the CN3 release. A record with a date after 7/20/1995 in the "last modified" field contains a revised value in one or more of its fields with the CN3 release.

Note for CN3: The CN code has been changed in all files from N5 to N6, and all tables now contain the fields Date_Added, Last_Modified and Status. All dates are represented as MM/DD/YYYY and are enclosed in ~ (tilde) symbols. A new Data Quality Control table (DQC) has been added to this release and additional value type codes have been added to the NUTVAL Table to describe the type of value for a nutrient.

CN2 Release: A record with a date after 1/31/94 in the "date added" field is a new record with the CN2 release. A record with a date after 1/31/94 in the "last modified" field contains a revised value in one or more of its fields with the CN2 release.  

Note for CN2:  A new field in the FOOD DESCRIPTION file--Form of Food--has been added to this file in the CN2 release. Form of food identifies whether a brand food requires additional preparation before serving (as purchased) or does not require any additional preparation before serving (as served).
The abbreviated descriptions for standardized recipes are the descriptions, which are listed on each recipe card.  A new field--Nutrient Unit--has been added to the NUTDES file.  The Nutrient Unit identifies the measure (calories, grams, milligrams, International Units, etc.) for reporting a nutrient in the Nutrient Values file.  The Buying Guide Code in the BUYGD file has replaced the Market Code. 

In CN2, new fields were added to make the descriptions for foods in the FDES file stand-alone.  In the first release of the CN-D, the include description was not always stand-alone.  For some foods, there was only a qualifying phrase such as "with fruit" for instant oatmeal.  The complete identification of an INCLUDE food required both the individual INCLUDE DESCRIPTION and the DESCRIPTION from the FDES file for the linked CN code.  Fields added for the CN2 release included the following: Food Category Code, Abbreviated Descriptor, Product Code, Manufacturer Name, Form of Food, Recipe Code, and Source Code. The Include Description or Brand/Label field was expanded in the CN2 release from a 100 to a 200 character field.

As with the FOOD INCLUDE file, new fields were added to the FOOD SUBCODE DESCRIPTION file in order to make the descriptions stand-alone since the CN1 release.  Fields added are the following--Food Category Code, Abbreviated Descriptor, Product Code, Manufacturer Name, Form of Food, Recipe Code and Source Code.  The Subcode Descriptor field was expanded from a 100 to a 200 character field.

1Release 8 was presented with a new table structure for the GMWT and MDES data.  CN8 adopted a format similar to the WEIGHT table structure used in the Standard Reference 15 Weight table.  This table structure was adopted because it is an effective way to combine the weight and measure description information, and because it makes for a more efficient way to incorporate Standard Reference data in the CN Database.  In order to implement this change in the CN Database, the MDES table was removed and the data from the MDES table was added to the GMWT table.  This combined GMWT and MDES table was renamed the WEIGHT table to follow the Standard Reference naming convention. 

2The MSFTCHG File was marked as discontinued in CN10 and was removed from CN11.

3CN8 included an updated Food Buying Guide File which reflects the changes made in the November 2001, Revised Food Buying Guide for Child Nutrition Programs (Program aid 1331). 

4The FINCL, FSUBCOD, and FSUBDES Files were marked as discontinued in CN13 and were removed in CN14.
