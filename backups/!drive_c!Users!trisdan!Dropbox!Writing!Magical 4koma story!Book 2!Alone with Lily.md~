Alone with Lily... By Cora.
===========================
I told Nora a story about why I want to become better friends with Lily, which you might have heard. Nora, that porridge head, seemed to buy it. It wasn't a lie, really, but it wasn't the whole truth.

The story I told the porridge head was that Lily helped me apologize to my fourth-grade teacher, Mr. Grayson, after I flipped out, threw a book at the window, and ran out of the classroom. And that did happen, but don't tell me you didn't wonder why a little thing like that had me still bringing Lily cake and pretending to like Nora and Ranta just to be around her, even two years later.

Mr. Grayson is a nutjob. The whole school knows it. Only three people I know of around here are nuttier than him. One is Mr. Wardlaw, that math freak who declared Nora a national wonder because she solved a few stupid puzzles. The other two are Mr. Grayson's twin daughters, Asha and Elma Grayson. Like father, like daughter.

I'd try to explain Asha and Elma Grayson to you, but I wouldn't be able to. Words can't express how crazy those two are. Everyone calls them the Wooden Girls. Not that that explains anything. I didn't even understand why they were called that until Lily explained it to me—it's because ash and elm are trees, and their names are *Ash*a and *Elm*a.

I think it's also because trying to fight those two is like fighting a couple of trees.  Asha has the Gift of Might, so her punches are like a tree falling on you, and Elma has the gift of Swift Healing, so attacking her is about as effective as attacking a tree trunk. They were also as deaf as trees, when I tried to explain what really happened.  It's like fighting two angry trees, that chase you until you drop dead from tiredness, then beat you up.

But they never did beat me up, and it's all thanks to Lily. You could say she saved me from a couple of nutjobs so crazy they make their father look like Miss Hanover. And I never even thanked her for it. I never asked her to be my friend, like Nora asked me that day. I never gave her the chance to shoot me down, to tell me that she had lots of cool friends over at the middle school and didn't need some little kid cramping her style.

I was finally going to do it that day. I brought her cake, hoping she'd take pity on me and let me down easy. I walked over to the clubroom with my head full of dreams that she *wouldn't* shoot me down, that we'd become friends and I could spend every day around the bravest, most honorable person I've ever known.

I came in and found Nora.

That was the biggest disappointment of my life. Somehow, that little porridge-headed schizoid had done in two months what I hadn't been able to do in two years; not only had she asked Lily to be her friend, Lily had actually said yes.

In a way, though, she'd done me a favor. When Lily asked her to join the club, I spoke up and asked to join too, and now I had an excuse to be around Lily every day. But we hardly ever got to be alone—usually Ranta or Nora were around. If Nora was around, I couldn't talk to Lily because she would focus all her attention on Nora. It was impossible to get any peace with Ranta around; she would start some fight with me, and I wouldn't have the chance to talk with Lily.

But I got lucky one afternoon. Lily, Nora, and I were sitting in the clubroom drinking tea. It was still nice and sunny, but a cool wind was blowing across the grounds, so I had gone to my room after class and changed out of my shorts and T-shirt into a skirt and tights. I sat drinking my tea, watching Nora read and Lily water the plants, as always, wishing Nora and the plants would both disappear and I could be alone with Lily.

I set the cup on the saucer and glanced at Nora's book. Funny, she was reading *Horror High*. Amy, one of the girls from class, liked to read those, but they didn't seem like Nora's kind of book. One thing Nora and I agreed on was that obsessing over clothes and boyfriends was stupid. Plus, she usually only read books written by dead people. Maybe some of those dead authors had become undead, and had kids at Horror High.

I was about to ask her why she was reading it, just to have something to do, when the door opened and Ranta came in. "Afternoon, everyone," she said. Lily put down the watering can and went to get tea for her, but Ranta shook her head. "Actually, I'm going right back out. The bookstore from town is having a book fair over at the high school. I just came to see if anyone wanted to come along."

"Oh, I do!" said Nora immediately, shutting *Horror High* and putting it in her bag. "Lily, is it all right if I leave my bag here?"

"Of course," said Lily.  Ranta left her bag too, placing it under the table alongside Nora's.

"I'll pass," I said. "The last thing I need today is more farging books."

"Pretty much what I expected from a cretin like you. Lily?"

"No, but you two have fun," said Lily. "If you see your brother, tell him hello for me."

Ranta made a face, but said she would, and she and Nora left.

I'd make a face too, if my brother was named Aurelio Reyes and made costumes for the theater club. He sounded like a fluttery wuss. Luckily, my brother Lucian is awesome, even if he can be the world's biggest jerk. 

I sipped my tea again for a moment after Ranta and Nora had left, wondering what to do now that I couldn't even watch Nora read, when I realized that Lily and I were now alone in the room. All of a sudden, I felt tense. There was a catch in my chest, and my hands started shaking so badly that I put the saucer back on the table.

Lily, on the other hand, was going back to her watering as if nothing had happened. She got the small stool that Miss Hanover had found for her from the corner and stood on it to water the climbing vines. There were little alcoves all around the upper walls of this room, with shelves in front of them. I didn't know what they were really for, but Lily had put plants in most of them, and some of the plants had reached their vines all the way across the white ceiling and started twisting their tendrils around the light fixtures. 

"Those two are such peas in a pod," Lily commented as she put down her watering can to move to the next alcove. "It makes me feel left out sometimes."

"You've got your middle school friends," I said. I paused, feeling like a lump of oatmeal was stuck in my throat. "And—"

I was about to say *And me*, but Lily looked at me, something strange in her eyes, and I suddenly felt even more uncomfortable. I took off my glasses and started polishing them, just to have an excuse not to meet her gaze anymore.

She turned away again, going back to her watering with a preoccupied air. Once I couldn't pretend my glasses needed to be cleaner anymore, I set them down on the table.

"Um, Lily, so, what do you think of this outfit?" I asked, standing up to show her my clothes. I wasn't much of a clothes shopper, but I liked to dress up around Lily. She was so graceful and elegant that she even made her gardening overalls look like high fashion; I couldn't match that, but at least I could look decent.

Lily glanced quickly over her shoulder from her perch on the stool. "It suits you," she said.

I could feel my cheeks turning red. "Th-thank you," I stammered, as tongue-tied as Nora.

"But the most important thing is what you think," Lily added, turning her eyes back to the flowerpot in the alcove. "Do you prefer to dress like this? Or do you prefer to wear your T-shirt and shorts?"

"Mostly I like to wear clothes that're easy to move in," I admitted. "And it's nice if I don't have to care whether I get dirty. But also, everyone in class kind of expects me to dress like that. I've been doing it since third grade, so that's just how they all see me."

"I see," said Lily.

I sat down again, feeling awkward. I shouldn't have done that. But I'd been dressing up for Lily ever since I'd joined the club, and she'd never seemed to notice.

A few more minutes passed in strained silence, feeling like a few hours. I finished my tea, now mostly room temperature, and fiddled with the spoon next to the sugar dish, coated with a crust of sugar that had stuck to the wet spoon after it had gone into the tea, then back into the sugar dish.

This was my chance, I knew. I could finally apologize to Lily for getting the Wooden Girls mad at her, and ask her to be my friend.

The only problem was, I couldn't.

I settled for finishing off Nora's half-empty cup of tea. What? Being a porridge head isn't contagious.

Lily finally finished her watering, put the stool back in the corner, and came over to the table to have a cup of tea. I watched her pour herself a cup, add a tiny amount of cream, and skip the sugar, as she always did. She concentrated on her cup, acting as if I weren't there.

I went to speak, but my tongue felt like it was stuck to the roof of my mouth. I managed to crack my lips and unstick my tongue, and the following words came out.

"Um. So. Have you. Um. Seen the Wooden Girls recently?"

A look of distaste crossed Lily's face, then passed. "No. Well, they're always making a spectacle of themselves. Asha destroyed a priceless marble statue the other day, while chasing down someone who shoplifted from the high school convenience store. But they haven't bothered me at all recently."

"Oh. That's—that's good. Um, listen, about back then—I mean, I really...really don't know what I'm trying to say."

Lily shrugged. "The Wooden Girls are popular, but they don't really decide who's popular and who's not. They're too busy with their hero of justice game for that. And they haven't bothered me at all since their father explained things to them."

She went back to her tea, looking even more preoccupied than before. Even though she said the Wooden Girls hadn't bothered her, it seemed like she didn't like talking about them. I had to come up with something else to talk about so she wouldn't have to think about them.

"Um, so, I made a pretty nice save in PE the other day, when we were playing soccer," I mentioned.

"Oh, really."

"Yeah. Mikaela was coming at me, and she's on the soccer team, so everyone thought I was done for. But I surprised her and got the ball away from her, just as she was going to shoot at our goalie."

"How nice for you." Lily didn't seem to care. Of course she didn't; here I was just rambling on and on about myself. Anyone would be bored, especially someone who didn't even like sports, like Lily.

"Um, so how have you been sleeping?" I asked. I took off my glasses and started polishing them on my skirt. I could feel my tail twitching back and forth nervously through the gap in the chair where the back met the seat.

"Fine. What about you? Is your roommate still keeping you awake at night?"

I winced. "Sometimes. Victoria's not so bad, but I got kinda tired of listening to her sing opera, especially early in the morning. So I got the record player to drown her out, and she got pretty mad at me. But she's mostly calmed down now." I'd had one last go at drowning her out; I'd asked Nora for advice on making a Victoria-proof record player, and Nora had suggested I put vibration dampeners on it so it wouldn't shake itself apart. My new megramophone had survived Victoria's old standbys "I Cannot Be Drowned Out By Cora's Brother's Old Record Player" and "I Cannot Be Drowned Out By the Record Player Cora Bought at the High School Store", but she had written a new song, "I Cannot Be Drowned Out By Cora's Megramophone That She Had The New Girl Build For Her", which had destroyed my megramophone just as my last two record players had been destroyed.

"Do you have a roommate?" I asked Lily, trying to keep the conversation going now that it was flowing a little bit.

"Yes," said Lily.

"You get it, then. Nora and Ranta both live alone, so they don't really understand how it is when you have a roommate. What's she like?"

"Her name is Alexis, and I'd rather not talk about her," said Lily.

"Does that mean you don't get along with her?" I asked, foolishly, but not as foolish as what I was about to say. "I don't know how that's possible. I'd like to claw anyone who doesn't get along with you."

Lily's expression grew cold, and she set down her teacup. "If only it were that simple," she said. She stood abruptly. "I'm going. Tell Nora and Ranta when they get back."

"Oh...okay," I said. "See you tomorrow."

Lily gathered her things and left, not even bothering to put her garden trowel in her satchel, and leaving me totally confused. Obviously, I made her mad, but I couldn't figure out how. I would've expected her to get mad at me when I brought up the Wooden Girls, but if anything, she was trying to make me feel better about the whole thing. Or maybe she was mad about the Wooden Girls, but it was my idiotic babbling afterwards that made her mad enough to want to leave.

Either way, I'd missed my golden opportunity. Lily and I still weren't friends, and I still hadn't thanked her for what she'd done for me.

I felt my eyes getting wet. How stupid of me! This was nothing to cry over. I knew that, but I still somehow felt like crying.

In the end, I went to sit in the window seat with the curtains drawn and waited until Nora and Ranta came back. "Where's Lily?" Ranta asked.

"She left," I said.

"Where'd she go?" Nora asked.

"How should I know? She probably got bored waiting for you guys to come back from that stupid book fair, you took forever!" I tore back the curtains and stood up, suddenly angry. Ranta looked surprised, and Nora was twitching and jittering for some reason. Both were holding brown paper bags that I assumed were full of dumb books.

I stomped past Nora and Ranta. "Anyway, I guarded your stupid stuff until you came back. You're welcome," I snapped. I stormed out the door, slamming it shut behind me, and headed back to a dorm room full of opera music.
