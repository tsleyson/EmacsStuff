- Don't reuse the color of Lily's eyes in the insert or in the "Puzzles aren't that hard" frontispiece.
  Use the color from the Book 1 Lily insert, the light blue. (I changed it, so it does use that color now.)
- Ranta insert: I used Curves, added an orange cast to the shadows on her skin (increase red and green to about 2/3 of 
  red) and a purple cast to her shirt shadows (decrease green) to match the colors in the sky behind her. The grass
  is Tapered brush dynamics. Shadows were drawn in with a brush at 50% hardness.
