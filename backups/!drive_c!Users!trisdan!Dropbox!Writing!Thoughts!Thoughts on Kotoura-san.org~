* Thoughts on Kotoura-san, begun <2014-11-03 Mon>
** Episode 1
This has been around for a while, but I never watched it. But I wanted to save the last two episodes of Hanayamata to watch either as a set or across two days, and I still had some time, so I started looking for another show and found this. 

The main character, Haruka Kotoura, is a girl with the ability to read minds. She was born with this power and began ruining the lives of her classmates by innocently exposing their white lies and social truths, not from malice, but just because she’s puzzled that their words and their thoughts are so at odds with each other. Her teacher tells her mother, Kumiko, that she’s a compulsive liar. Kumiko brings her to various pediatricians and gets angrier and angrier as they all find nothing wrong with Haruka. (I thought some of those doctors might be psychiatrists, but given how compulsive Haruka is about telling people what she sees in their minds, it’s hard to believe she wouldn’t have done it with any of the psychiatrists and led them to figure out what’s going on with her.) Meanwhile, Haruka’s parents’ marriage is falling apart because Kumiko is getting no support at all from her husband, who works late every day and tells her it’s her job to raise Haruka and he’s not going to have anything to do with it. It finally falls apart entirely when Haruka innocently mentions that her father is seeing another woman that night, and her mother is having dinner with another man. Her mother leaves Haruka with her grandfather (his family name is also Kotoura, so he seems to be her father’s father), the only person who still cares about her, and leaves. When Haruka begs her to say, staying she’ll take over the housework, Kumiko looks on her with hatred and disgust and says she wishes she’d never given birth to Haruka.

Haruka’s social life at school also falls apart, with her friends abandoning her because she’s too weird and mind-readingy. By the time Haruka figures out what their problem is, it’s already too late; she’s lost all her friends and she’s fallen into a habit of resentfully using people’s thoughts against them to hurt them, or airing out whatever negative thoughts they might have while they’re talking to her. She transfers schools, to the relief of the teacher she tells (though he at least tries to be nice and wish her good luck, he thinks that he’s glad he won’t have to deal with her anymore).

At her new school, Haruka starts off badly by introducing herself in two words (her name) while scowling, and sarcastically telling the teacher she’s sorry to be a pain when she hears him wondering what her problem is. Everyone is immediately turned off, except for Manabe-kun, the guy who sits next to her, who was busy having sexual fantasies about some weird purple creature and didn’t even notice she was up there. 

Some of the other students try to talk to her, but Haruka hears the class president thinking she doesn’t really care to know where Haruka transferred from and says not to ask if she doesn’t care; she also hears another student who asks what club Haruka is planning to join hope that it’s not the tennis club, and tells her she doesn’t need to worry because Haruka has no interest in tennis. She drives everyone away by doing this, so that pretty soon, no one comes near her desk except for Manabe, who’s pretty much oblivious to it all. One day, a girl asks Manabe if he’s going to accept her invitation to come by the house; Manabe says he doesn’t want to go to a karate dojo and he’s going to pass, devastating her. Haruka hears him thinking that the girl wants to recruit him to her family’s dojo because of his martial arts skills and explains that she doesn’t care about his martial arts skills. 

Soon after, Manabe randomly plunks down his food on Haruka’s desk at lunchtime and says they’re eating together. Haruka hears him think that her lunch looks really good, and offers him some, to his delight. She tries to avoid him the next day by eating on the roof, but Manabe tracks her down and won’t leave her alone, asking her if she reads minds. As Haruka stomps off, Manabe gets her to come back by imagining her naked and sexy, prompting her to return and yell at him.

Manabe waylays Haruka in town one day on her way back from getting groceries. Haruka tells him she lives alone, and that’s why she’s shopping for herself, and that she can’t be around anyone because of her mind-reading powers. As Manabe steps into the street, a truck comes barrelling through the red light, but Haruka saves him because she could read the driver’s mind and knew he was going to run the red light. She gets a minor scrape in the process, so Manabe brings her back to her apartment (which is quite nice for a high school student, but her grandfather seemed to be rich) and puts a bandage on it for her. 

Haruka doesn’t quite accept Manabe as a friend, but she certainly seems intrigued by the fact that he totally ignores all her warnings about how she’ll ruin his life and his biggest worry about associating with her is that she’ll be able to see all the perverted things he thinks about.

So far it’s pretty interesting. I wrote about it much more enthusiastically than I thought I was going to, so it must be pretty good. I could see it going bad in the future, but for now I like it, and I think I’ll watch it after I finish Hanayamata. Haruka has a very orange color scheme, with her eyes and hair both orange and her cheeks often blushing. It’s kind of weird that both of her parents have black hair. (Her grandfather’s hair is grey, so maybe he had orange hair when he was younger.) Judging by the opening, Kumiko is going to reappear at some point. I guess that’s why she has a face, while Haruka’s father is faceless and apparently nameless. 

Unlike Hanayamata, which has an interesting cast of little-knowns, Kotoura-san uses big names, including Hisako Kanemoto as Haruka Kotoura-san herself (previously seen as Yui in Kokoro Connect and Ika Musume in Shinryaku! Ika Musume) and Kana Hanazawa as another main character who appears later. It’s kind of nice to hear the familiar voices, but it’s also kind of nice when you can just think of a character without thinking of all the other roles played by the same actor, and establish a unique connection in your mind between a character and a voice.
