        <p class="standard">I
didn't think it was possible.</p><p class="standard">Common
sense suggests that once a King Cobra has sunk its fangs into a
person, and injected large amounts of a deadly toxin, that person is
dead if the antivenin is not administered in a timely manner. </p><p class="standard">Common
sense also suggests that there's no such thing as a retroactive
antivenin that can cause a person to whom the proactive antivenin was
not administered in a timely manner to spring back to life.</p><p class="standard">In
other words, once you're dead, you're dead.</p><p class="standard">But
standing there, in that cold metal refrigerator, dimly lit by
fluorescent lights, I watched that money-grubbing old hick pull
towards him a gurney on which lay the stiffest sort of stiff you can
imagine. I watched that money-grubbing old hick hook up that
suspicious device, like some kind of nipple-pinching egg timer, to
the stiff's nipples.</p><p class="standard">In
that cold metal refrigerator, in that eerily silent and empty
hospital basement, I watched that money-grubbing old hick use some
quack medical machine.</p><p class="standard">Only
it worked. It did what no quack I knew of had even claimed to do, and
the stiff sat up, color returning to his pale skin, movement
returning to his immobile limbs, life returning to his dead eyes. </p><p class="standard">For
this, the stiff's parents had paid him ten thousand dollars.</p><p class="standard">And
when the stiff had overcome his stiffness, and his confusion, the
first question he asked was "Wasn't I dead?"</p><p class="standard">Yes,
said the money-grubbing old hick. You were dead.</p><p class="standard">Wanna
know who killed you?</p><p class="standard">The
stiff wanted to know.</p><p class="standard">I
didn't know, but I told him anyway. Even though I know that people
don't generally appreciate being killed, and often try to kill those
who kill them back. Even though I knew that blood would be on my
hands, and even though I didn't know who had done it, I told him.</p><p class="standard">The
hick agreed with me. With a smile, he agreed with me, even though I
didn't know.</p><p class="standard">Then
he brought the stiff upstairs, to where his personal items were.
Other than all the cash in his wallet being gone, it was all there.</p><p class="standard">I
wouldn't doubt that the hick took the cash.</p>

      <div class="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard">It's
easy to forget, but I am a college student.</p><p class="standard">I
attend the most mediocre state university in California, a place
famous for its bars, parties, and distinguished tradition of goldfish
swallowing. The students are mostly party animals taking a four-year
vacation from reality on their parents' (or the government's) dime
before coming out with a degree in American Studies that earns them
the distinguished position of general manager of a titty bar. The
faculty includes a man who once had delusions of becoming President
of the United States before realizing that he was hated by almost
everyone he knew; a woman who attempted to earn her PhD in geology by
essentially making a volcano that spewed baking soda and vinegar; and
a transvestite who shows up to teach economics in women's clothing
and a wig on even-numbered dates, pretending to be his own
substitute. The buildings themselves are crumbling, moldering,
asbestos-filled, lead-painted ruins; the library has shoved all the
academic papers and books into storage and filled their shelves with
the latest swimsuit issue of <i>Sports Illustrated</i>and tens of
copies of <i>Twilight</i>; and the
cafeteria serves fishsticks every Tuesday.</p><p class="standard">Yet
I am so worthless that I don't deserve even to be at this school.</p><p class="standard">Truly,
I don't know where I get off being so irritated with the many
disappointments of my school. After all, I'm hardly a model student.</p><p class="standard">But
it just bugs me.</p><p class="standard">Even
though I just finished failing exams in all my classes.</p><p class="standard">Somehow,
it just bugs me that my school fails so badly at being a school, even
though I fail even worse at being a student.</p><p class="standard">It's
all her fault, I know it. </p><p class="standard">Always
driving me to school, driving me home from school, sitting next to me
during lunch, talking to me before and after class, taking me out to
eat, and sometimes calling me on weekends. It's all too distracting.
Just the knowledge that she's calling me from the newest model iPhone
is enough to preoccupy me with anger and make me unable to study for
two days.</p><p class="standard">Also,
there was that ruckus six weeks ago, when we first met, wherein I was
nearly killed not once, not twice, but three times (and so was she,
the third time) and dirtied myself by beating a sixteen-year-old girl
with a folding metal chair, as if I were some kind of professional
wrestler.</p><p class="standard">I
was expecting the WWE to call and offer me a contract. I didn't study
because I thought they'd make me a wrestling superstar, and I
wouldn't have to go to the most mediocre college in the state of
California anymore.</p><p class="standard">Anyway,
it was all just too distracting. I'm better off alone. Having friends
weakens you as a human. Someone I respect very much once said that.
Although in the end, he succumbed to the lure of the sacred feminine
and dated a psychotic woman.</p><p class="standard">Well,
there's no danger of that happening to me.</p><p class="standard">In
any case, sooner or later, my mother was going to ask me what had
happened on my midterm exams. She had already seen the first round
and had been unimpressed with my performance, asking me if I was
really being serious and lecturing me for several hours about how
hard she and my father worked to pay for me to go to college.</p><p class="standard">This
recent second round, however, made that first round look like a
glowing success. The first time, though I had been knocked out, it
was a mere technical knockout.</p><p class="standard">This
time, I'd taken a massive uppercut straight to the jaw and had been
knocked flat on my back. I might be bleeding. I might need medical
attention. I might never box again.</p><p class="standard">Luckily,
I had not mentioned to my mother that I was having a second round of
midterms. Since she worked in education herself (as a worthless,
overpaid administrator, not as a teacher), however, she would soon
figure out that it must have come. Fortunately, we didn't see each
other much; she left the house before I woke up, and I usually came
back after she was asleep.</p><p class="standard">So
I thought.</p><p class="standard">Today,
for some reason, my mother had not left before I woke up as was her
habit. Instead, I found her sitting at the kitchen table, looking as
if she had been waiting for me.</p><p class="standard">I
jumped.</p><p class="standard">"Good
morning, James," said my mother.</p><p class="standard">Uh-oh.
She never says good morning to me. She usually greets me by
complaining about the phone bill. </p><p class="standard">"Good
morning, my dearest and favorite mother," I tried, hoping I
could get out of this with only a lecture whose length was measurable
in minutes. Even fifty-nine minutes and fifty-nine point nine seconds
would be okay. Just as long as it stayed shy of an hour.</p><p class="standard">"I
hear that second midterms have just about finished in every class at
your school," said my mother, cutting right to the chase.</p><p class="standard">I
got a bowl, a box of Raisin Bran, and a jug of milk out and set them
on the table. If I was going to be lectured, I might as well eat at
the same time. "Really? That's odd, because I haven't had a
second midterm in a single class."</p><p class="standard">"Really.
That is odd."</p><p class="standard">"Odd
it is." I poured some cereal into the bowl, realized I'd
forgotten to get a spoon, and stood up to get one, hoping that Sophia
would arrive soon to pick me up and end this conversation. My mother
was all coiled up, like a rattlesnake about to strike. I could almost
hear the tail shaking. I wanted to get away from this dangerous
venomous creature. My mother, snake-like as she was, liked Sophia,
regarding her as a fine young woman, a paragon of youth, a young lady
in the tradition of young American ladies, who would fit in just as
well wearing a V-neck sweater in the fifties as wearing a hooded
sweatshirt today. Because she was such a fine young woman, my mother
would never make her wait outside for hours while she lectured her
idiot son, so the appearance of Sophia's navy blue Audi in our
driveway marked rescue for me, as sure as if Steve Irwin had suddenly
appeared and grabbed this dangerous snake by the neck. </p><p class="standard">My
mother, incidentally, didn't know that Sophia had actually once been
wearing a V-neck sweater in the fifties, the first time she'd gone to
college. </p><p class="standard">My
mother, incidentally, did seem to know many other things she
shouldn't, like what I was thinking at this moment, because she said,
"Sophia isn't coming today. I called her and told her you and I
needed to talk, and I would drive you today."</p><p class="standard">"I
see."</p><p class="standard">It
seems Steve Irwin is dead in both a literal and a metaphorical sense,
then.</p><p class="standard">"Of
course, it was a lie."</p><p class="standard">"Of
course." My mother, to this day, will not drive me anywhere, due
to a thoughtless remark I made when I was thirteen.</p><p class="standard">"So,
James, why don't we stop this. Tell me how your tests went. It can't
be good, otherwise you would've said something sooner instead of
trying to hide it from me."</p><p class="standard">"Well,
you know. Average."</p><p class="standard">"Don't
lie to me."</p><p class="standard">Often,
when I lied to my mother, she would pretend to believe me so she
could have the pleasure of watching me shoot myself in the foot
later. That she didn't this time showed me how furious she was.</p><p class="standard">"James,
your father and I work hard every day to make money for this family.
We have to take care of Sue and Mia, make sure they have clothes and
food and a house. I'm sure you know this."</p><p class="standard">I
allowed that I did.</p><p class="standard">"Some
day they might want to go to college. And Lucy, if she ever comes
home, she might want to go to college."</p><p class="standard">I
allowed that that was possible.</p><p class="standard">"But
instead of saving for that, we're paying thirteen hundred dollars a
month for you to fail your tests, play around with girls, and post
trashy neighborhood gossip on the Internet. Now let me ask you: does
that sound like a good use of money to you?"</p><p class="standard">I
allowed that it did not. </p><p class="standard">And
I knew better than to object to her characterization of my blog or
the time I spent with Sophia when she was this mad.</p><p class="standard">"Your
father and I are not paying thirteen hundred dollars a month for you
to have a four-year vacation from working at Best Buy. If all you're
going to do is waste our money, go back to work there. They seemed to
think you had some talent for hooking up new TVs for people; since
you don't seem to have a talent for anything else, why don't you go
back there?"<br />As you may have gathered from my
self-flagellation earlier, pride is not one of my deadly sins. Wrath,
yes. Gluttony, occasionally. Avarice, sometimes. Sloth, often. Lust,
at least once a week. Envy, all over the place (much of it directed
at Sophia, unlike the lust, which I had never wasted on her).</p><p class="standard">Pride,
never.</p><p class="standard">Never
except now.</p><p class="standard">Because
my mother's last remark had incited me to wrath.</p><p class="standard">"I'm
trying, okay?" I burst out. "Do you know how hard it is to
study in a hostile environment like this? With you constantly nagging
me about the phone bill, and treating me like a&amp;emdash;a black man in 1950
Alabama?"</p><p class="standard">"How
dare you!" my mother yelled, standing up and knocking her chair
over. "I cook your food,  wash your clothes, pay your phone bill
so you can carry on whatever weird fixation you have on your sister,
and I don't think it's unreasonable to ask that you show some kind of
results for the thirteen hundred dollars we pay every month! If
that's not good enough for you—if this environment is so
hostile—then maybe you'd better find somewhere else to live
while you study for your next test!" She stormed out of the
room, grabbing her purse so hard that a tube of lipstick went flying
out of it and ricocheted off the refrigerator as she left.</p>

      <h2 class="heading"><a id="Chapter_2"><h3 align="CENTER" class="western"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">02</font></h3></a></h2>
      <div class="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard">"What's
wrong?" Sophia asked as we left the economics class we shared
and headed for the cafeteria to eat some fishsticks and recharge our
energy for math.</p><p class="standard">"Why
would anything be wrong?"</p><p class="standard">"Because
you didn't say a single thing about Nashville's Equilibrium the whole
class period."</p><p class="standard">As
usual, people were staring at us was we walked down the halls. At
first, I thought Sophia was some kind of celebrity and everyone was
amazed that she would be seen with a commoner like me, but I soon
realized that they were staring because she always looked like she'd
dressed herself with impeccable taste, yet somehow forgotten to get
rid of her bed head, and they were laughing at her. </p><p class="standard">"Nothing's
wrong, just. I failed my midterm, so I thought I might pay attention
for once."</p><p class="standard">She
laughed.</p><p class="standard">She
laughed at me.</p><p class="standard">She
laughed at the idea that I might try to pay attention in class.</p><p class="standard">Well,
it was pretty laughable. I was about as interested in economics as
Kim Jong Il was in feeding the hungry and healing the sick.</p><p class="standard">However,
I couldn't let that slide.</p><p class="standard">"Don't
laugh at me, you computer nerd! I can pay attention in class just
like you can!"</p><p class="standard">Sophia
had once majored in computer science and electrical engineering. I
didn't really know what that was, or even if it was one major or two,
but for some reason, being called a computer nerd bothered her, so I
made sure to call her one as often as I could.</p><p class="standard">In
this case, though, she let it slide, and pushing her mousy brown hair
back over her shoulder with a graceful gesture, said, "That
story would be easier to believe if you hadn't held up your exam that
you got thirty-three out of one hundred points on and flashed me a V
for victory sign when we got them back last week."</p><p class="standard">I
had no memory of doing that, but if she said it had happened, it must
be true. Sophia wouldn't lie to me. She would just refuse to tell me
anything.</p><p class="standard">For
example, when we first met, she answered all my questions about why
she had investigated me with "It's a secret".</p><p class="standard">Then
there was the conversation we'd had a few weeks ago.</p><p class="standard">We'd
been sitting in an Indian restaurant in downtown Santa Robles, eating
our ways through big plates of curried lamb, sag panir, and samosas
and drinking chai with lots of milk. For some reason, she had started
asking me to go to restaurants with her a lot around that time, and
since I would be going home to a nice aluminum tray of frozen turkey
and peas, I had consented to go.</p><p class="standard">Trying
to find out just how screwed I was now that I was associating with
her, I'd asked her questions.</p><p class="standard">"Are
you people common?"</p><p class="standard">"Classified
information."</p><p class="standard">"Are
there lots of different types?"</p><p class="standard">"Classified
information."</p><p class="standard">"Do
you fear the cross?"</p><p class="standard">"Classified
information."</p><p class="standard">"Do
you have an adamantium skeleton?"</p><p class="standard">"Classified
information."</p><p class="standard">"Do
you sparkle in the sunlight?"</p><p class="standard">"Classified
information."</p><p class="standard">"Where's
the rebel base?"</p><p class="standard">"Classified
information."</p><p class="standard">"What's
your real age?"<br />She had put her index finger to her lips
and, with a wink, said "Classified information!"</p><p class="standard">Then
I had asked her how she knew about Mikuru-chan, and she admitted to
reading the book I had forgotten in her car the other day and
resolving to use that joke the next time I asked for any kind of
information.</p><p class="standard">In
the end, though, she still hadn't told me anything, so I guess it
really was classified. </p><p class="standard">Because
of that, I wasn't really in the mood to tell her anything.</p><p class="standard">Still,
she might be able to help me.</p><p class="standard">"I
fought with my mother this morning," I said. "About failing
my exams."</p><p class="standard">"Oh."</p><p class="standard">I
held the door open for her and followed her out of the building into
the concrete courtyard, getting on a path towards the cafeteria.
"That's all you have to say?"</p><p class="standard">"I
can't say I'm surprised. You and your mother don't seem to get along
very well."</p><p class="standard">"She's
always nagging me about the phone bill. Even if I wanted to get along
with her, she won't let me."</p><p class="standard">"At
the same time, though, don't you think she just wants what's best for
you? That she's being hard on you so that you'll do well in school
and be able to have a better future?"</p><p class="standard">"No,
no, no."</p><p class="standard">"I
only made two statements, so you didn't need to say 'no' three times
to deny them all."</p><p class="standard">"The
third one was just a blanket denial of your existence and everything
you say."</p><p class="standard">She
laughed again, and held open the door for me so we could enter the
cafeteria. </p><p class="standard">We
were out of luck; it wasn't fishstick day after all. Today was
"chicken cacciatore" day. I had never had real chicken
cacciatore, but I highly doubted that it was anything like the weird,
milky soup of pureed chicken entrails and tomato sauce that was
served in the school's cafeteria. But the only way we could leave
campus and be back in time for math was if we ate at the gas station;
even if we took Sophia's car, Santa Robles was a maze of one-way
streets that could never navigate fast enough to get back in time.
Not that I cared, but she had this weird thing about being to class
on time, every day, and I couldn't buy anything without borrowing
money from her, so I was stuck, and we got in line to buy two bowls
of what I had by now concluded was probably some sort of vomit, at
nine dollars each.</p><p class="standard">Oh,
wait. The nine dollars also included a six-ounce carton of milk or
miscellaneous juices of miscellaneous fruits, from concentrate, and a
fun-size bag of Funyuns. That's right; that was where the value of
the meal was.</p><p class="standard">"Anyway,
I said some things I shouldn't have," I continued.</p><p class="standard">"Everything
you say is something you shouldn't have said. But that's what's
charming about you."</p><p class="standard">I
blushed slightly. At first I would get angry at how she complimented
me so freely, but I guess I must have been getting used to it,
because by now I just got slightly embarrassed and tried to pretend
it hadn't happened. "I feel like it might be good if I stayed
somewhere else for a while and gave her time to cool off, but I don't
have anywhere to stay."</p><p class="standard">We
stopped at the register and Sophia paid, then we brought our food
into the courtyard outside and sat on a bench next to the saddest
fountain in the country, more of a mosquito hatchery than anything.
"Well, you wouldn't have brought this up if you didn't have some
scheme in mind," she said with a smile. "Of course, I
accept. You can stay with me."</p><p class="standard">"No,
I really wasn't angling for that or anything..."</p><p class="standard">"Well,
even if you weren't. Come on, stay with me. It'll be fun, like a
sleepover."</p><p class="standard">"You're
not worried about having a pathetic, desperate, amoral virgin
sleeping in the next—" I stopped myself in the middle. Of
course she wasn't.</p><p class="standard">In
case you haven't read the first book, I'll give you a quick rundown
of the most important facts regarding
this person named Sophia de Nuit.</p><p class="standard">Fact
1: By day, she appears to be a gawky, geeky biology student in
terrible need of a hairbrush.</p><p class="standard">Fact
2: By night, she sleeps with random men that she picks up in dive
bars, usually al fresco.</p><p class="standard">Fact
3: She has been alive since Robespierre took over France.</p><p class="standard">Fact
4: She is a succubus. That's some sort of creature that gains eternal
life and mutant powers by sucking the life force out of people. She
sucks the life force out of people through sex, which explains why
she sleeps with random men that she picks up in dive bars, al fresco.
It isn't just her hobby.</p><p class="standard">Fact
5: Follows from Fact 4—if I were to succumb to the prurient desire
of a pathetic, desperate, amoral twenty-two-year-old virgin sleeping
in the same house as a cute, slightly ditzy girl who likes to wear
strawberry-print underwear and leaves her bedroom door unlocked, I
would soon find myself just dust in the wind.</p><p class="standard">That
was exactly why I had never wasted even an iota of my deadly sinning
time feeling lust towards her, even though she was the only female
apparently near my own age who wasn't related to me that I spoke to
on a regular basis.</p><p class="standard">I've
often wondered if she hams up her ditzy nature, or if she's really
dumb enough to say something like "It'll be fun, like a
sleepover" after two hundred years of life.</p><p class="standard">But
now, displaying a soupçon
of sophistication, she responded to my half-uttered remark with, "I
know you're all talk, so I've got nothing to worry about. In the end,
I don't think I'll even have to lock the hamper."</p><p class="standard">"No,
I'm not into all that panty stealing stuff," I quickly
clarified.</p><p class="standard">And
don't say I'm all talk like that makes me a wimp. I may be a wimp,
but most people are all talk when it comes to doing things that will
end with them as gone from this world as the captain of the <i>Reliant
</i>was when Khan was done with him. If you can find someone who
talks about sleeping with this girl and then does it, given the full
knowledge that he will shrivel up into a pile of dust before he can
even finish enjoying himself, get him some antidepressants.</p><p class="standard">She
talks like that a lot, though.</p><p class="standard">Like
I'd survive spending the night with her.</p><p class="standard">She
does it so much that I forget the truth, and slip up, like I did when
I made the remark that started this discussion.</p><p class="standard">Maybe
she wants me to do her.</p><p class="standard">Doubtful.</p><p class="standard">"Anyway,
just stay with me. I have a guest room, so it'll be comfortable.
It'll be nice to have someone other than my cat around for once."</p><p class="standard">"Well..."</p><p class="standard">I
was just about to refuse. After all, who knew when my barely
controlled male virility would seize control of me, march me into her
room, strip off her teddy bear-print underwear, and rape her until I
was as gone from this world as the parents at the end of <i>Time
Bandits</i>?</p><p class="standard">I
pictured her covering her naked body with blankets and crying in a
British accent, "No, don't touch it, it's evil!"</p><p class="standard">I
looked at her.</p><p class="standard">She
looked at me, and tilted her head with confusion. "What strange
things are you thinking about?"</p><p class="standard">"Nothing.
Sorry, I don't think I can stay with you. Something we'll both regret
will happen. I might make you watch everything Terry Gilliam ever
directed, including <i>The
Brothers Grimm</i>."</p><p class="standard">"Oh,
you didn't like that one? Personally, I wasn't a big fan of <i>Fear
and Loathing in Las Vegas</i>."</p><p class="standard">"Are
you kidding? How can that be the one you pick to dislike? After <i>Time
Bandits </i>it's
the best one!"</p><p class="standard">"I
just didn't like it. The seventies were just another decade to me, so
maybe I'm missing something that other people see in it. Now come on,
I insist that you stay with me." She took paper from her
shoulder bag and wrote her address on it, then handed it to me.
"There's my address. If you leave the college going southeast
along Eastern Avenue, you'll see my street eventually. It shouldn't
be hard to find. Go home and get whatever you need, then come over,
and I'll have everything ready for you."</p><p class="standard">I
looked at the address, written on the paper in her impeccable
handwriting. She was the only person I'd ever known whose handwriting
had different fonts, and she changed every so often just for the fun
of it.</p><p class="standard">I
was just about to refuse again. But my mother was furious at me, and
besides, if I wanted to learn more about Sophia, her house was
probably a good place to do it.</p><p class="standard">"All
right. I'll stay with you. Just for a few days. Just to give my mom
time to calm down."</p><p class="standard">"Yes!
I'll make sure everything is perfect for you. And by the way, if you
don't come, I'll call Lucy and have her order you!"</p><p class="standard">"You
will never speak to Lucy! You're part of the wrong crowd. You'll have
my innocent little sister smoking pot, acting rebellious, sleeping
with random guys from dive bars, and sucking out their life force.
I'll die before I let you have her number."</p><p class="standard">"Don't
call me part of the wrong crowd. I'll have you know that I only tried
marijuana one time, and I didn't inhale."</p><p class="standard">"Wrong
crowd members like you die in the after-school specials. First you
use peer pressure to get my little sister to smoke pot, then you
start manically playing the piano, and then pretty soon she gets shot
by a gun that's pointed away from her."</p><p class="standard">"You're
part of the wrongest crowd around. There's nothing bad I can teach
Lucy that she hasn't already learned from being related to you."</p><p class="standard">"No
crowd is wronger than the crowd that contains you succubuses."</p><p class="standard">She
looked purely blissful as we spoke, as if she couldn't imagine
anything more fun than what we were doing right now.</p><p class="standard">I
couldn't believe anyone could be so happy over something like this.</p>

      <div class="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard">I
rode the bus home from school for the first time in a while, so that
Sophia could get to her place ahead of me and make sure everything
was ready. I didn't really know what "everything" was—she
didn't seem like the type to let things get too messy, especially
since she seemed to live alone, so it probably wasn't cleaning, but I
couldn't imagine what else it could be. </p><p class="standard">I
approached the house from far away, trying to make sure that my
mother's car wasn't in the driveway. It wasn't, so I was probably
safe. I went inside and saw that my sisters Sue and Mia were home and
were in the living room watching TV, but I didn't say anything and
sneaked past them upstairs to my room.</p><p class="standard">As
I was packing things up, shoving them into an old duffel bag that my
parents had bought for me when we'd gone camping when I was eleven, I
noticed that there was a message on my cell phone. I usually didn't
give my number out to anyone, so it was probably someone trying to
collect a debt from the previous owner of my number, but I figured I
would listen to it anyway.</p><p class="standard">By
the way, my cell phone, unlike Sophia's, is not the newest iPhone.
It's not the oldest iPhone. It's not even made by a major
corporation. We got it for free when my parents signed up for a
contract with our cellular carrier; instead of a brand name, it just
says Cell Phone,
and it sucks down battery life at an alarming rate. I once charged it
fully and left it turned off for seven hours, then turned it back on
to find that the battery was dead. I cannot text from it: it has
nothing like a keyboard, but instead has the old-fashioned mapping of
letters to the number pad that phone sex hotlines use to make their
phone numbers fit the sort of thing you'll hear if you call them. I
never carry it with me for two reasons: because most of the calls it
receives are attempts to collect a debt from the previous owner of
the number, and because it's embarrassing to admit that I own such a
worthless phone.</p><p class="standard">Having
this phone is yet more evidence that my mother hates me. After all,
Sue has a decent phone. Lucy has a decent phone (which I'm glad for,
since I call it so often). Even Mia has a decent phone, and she
doesn't even know how to use it. I have this thing.</p><p class="standard">But
I digress.</p><p class="standard">I
entered the PIN to access my voicemail and was surprised to hear a
familiar husky female voice speaking into my ear.</p><p class="standard">"Hello,
James, this is June Sullivan. I thought you might like to know that I
spoke to the police anonymously, and Wenjing Robson recently came up
for a hearing and was released from the mental hospital because of
what I told them."</p><p class="standard">That
was good. If Wenjing Robson could be with her son again because of
what I'd gone through six weeks ago, that almost made my near-death
experience worth it. Nothing quite made having nearly died worth the
mental scars, but that almost did.</p><p class="standard">"I
also heard from some of the other women in the neighborhood that you
ask them for gossip and rumors to investigate for your blog, and I
might have something for you. My neighbors' son died earlier today
under weird circumstances. If you want to know more, give me a call."
She gave her number at the end, then hung up.</p><p class="standard">I
dialed her number and waited a minute for her to pick up. When she
did, she said, "Hello, James."</p><p class="standard">"Hello,
Mrs. Sullivan."</p><p class="standard">"If
you don't call me June, I'm not going to tell you anything."</p><p class="standard">"June."</p><p class="standard">"Good
boy. The Thompsons, three houses down from me. Their son Brian died
earlier today. He's a high school student. According to what I hear,
he came out to his car after school and found a snake in the driver's
seat. A King Cobra."</p><p class="standard">"I
wonder how that got there."</p><p class="standard">"He
was rushed to the hospital as soon as he was discovered, but he'd
already been on the ground for several hours, unconscious, and there
was even more delay because the hospital had to have the
antivenom delivered from the Sacramento Zoo."</p><p class="standard">It's
actually 'antivenin', but I didn't bother to correct her; she hated
me enough as it was.</p><p class="standard">"Last
I heard, he was either dead or barely clinging to life. Either way,
the antivenom was too late. The police are investigating how a King
Cobra ended up in his car, of course, but since you specialize in
weird stuff I thought I'd call you."</p><p class="standard">I
didn't really specialize in weird stuff—at least, I hadn't
before I met Sophia. But when you meet someone because you're
investigating a rumor that her son is pregnant, it's easy to get
tagged as a specialist in weird stuff.</p><p class="standard">I
sat down at my desk and took out a notepad and a pen. "Do you
know anything else?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"Like
what?"</p><p class="standard">"I'm
sure none of us believes that King Cobra ended up in his car by
accident. What kind of person was he?"</p><p class="standard">"Brian
Thompson was a good kid. At least, he seemed like one. I don't have
teenagers, so I didn't hear about him except from his parents and
other mothers in the neighborhood, but they all said he was a nice
guy who wouldn't hurt a fly. I never heard about him being in
trouble."</p><p class="standard">I
scribbled down the most pertinent points as she spoke, and then
asked, "What school did he go to?"</p><p class="standard">"Jerry
Rice High School, I think."</p><p class="standard">My
alma mater. At any rate, Jerry Rice was the school I had actually
graduated from, though I'd spent more time at St. Augustine's.</p><p class="standard">Come
to think of it, my sister Sue currently attended Jerry Rice, if
memory served me.</p><p class="standard">Perhaps
I would have a nice chat with her before leaving.</p><p class="standard">In
the meantime, I had just one more question for June. "You must
hate me after what I did to you, and I can't say I don't deserve it.
Why did you contact me?"</p><p class="standard">"I
was angry at you. For about three weeks. But my son is back in
school, and no one knows anything was ever wrong, and I was able to
do something good for Mrs. Robson because of you, so I don't have any
reason to be angry anymore. Also..."</p><p class="standard">"Also...?"</p><p class="standard">"Not
many men have the balls to blatantly betray me like you did and then
call me up asking for a favor. I was intrigued. If you're a filthy
adult, I felt like I wanted to see just how filthy you could get."</p><p class="standard">I
wonder if this woman is mentally stable. She seems determined to make
me the center of some private fantasy. Not that she isn't
good-looking, but she's twice my age, married, has a son, and may be
suffering from undiagnosed personality disorders, so all in all, if I
slept with her, it would probably be almost as bad as if I slept with
Sophia. It might even be worse. Sophia would be a quick death; June
might make it slow, degrading, and excruciating.</p><p class="standard">So,
with that statement having made me incredibly uncomfortable, I told
June I would look into Brian Thompson's death and hung up, then
finished packing. I had my clothes in my duffel bag, my school
supplies in my backpack, and my computer in its travel case, and I
brought them down to the kitchen, preparing to leave.</p><p class="standard">Sue
was in the kitchen drinking soda directly from the two liter bottle.
When she saw me, she rolled her eyes and said, "I can only stand
so many episodes of <i>Yo
Gabba Gabba</i>."
She glanced at my bags. "Looks like things didn't go too well
with Mom this morning."</p><p class="standard">"You
could say that."</p><p class="standard">"She
was gonna make you sleep on the curb if she came back and found you
here."</p><p class="standard">"I'll
be gone by the time she gets back, but I need to talk to you first.
Do you know someone named Brian Thompson at your school?"</p><p class="standard">Sue
completely ignored my question and focused on just the first part of
what I had said. "You actually found somewhere to stay?"
She smirked her thinking-about-relationships smirk and took another
swig off the bottle of soda. "Is it with your girlfriend?"</p><p class="standard">"If
you are referring to Sophia de Nuit, then yes, it is with her, and
no, she is not my girlfriend. As it happens, she has a guest room,
where I will be staying."</p><p class="standard">Sue's
smirk widened. "Well, by tonight, as far as Mom knows, she's
pregnant with your child."</p><p class="standard">"Slander
and falsehood will gain you nothing. On the other hand, if you answer
my questions, I may be willing to do something for you."</p><p class="standard">"Oh
yeah? How about this: I'll trade whatever information you want for
three days' worth of calls to Lucy." She set the soda bottle on
the counter and reached up into the cupboard to dig for chips.</p><p class="standard">"Why
would you want that? All you do when Lucy is here is fight."</p><p class="standard">"I
never said I wanted to talk to her. I just want to stop <i>you
</i>from
talking to her."</p><p class="standard">I
thought about it. Sophia would probably be all over me as long as I
was staying at her place, and I often couldn't pay attention to poor
Lucy when I was investigating a story, so maybe it was worth it.</p><p class="standard">"Two
days."</p><p class="standard">"Three."</p><p class="standard">"Two,
and I'll get you and your friends into the next Alpha Beta Gamma frat
party on campus."</p><p class="standard">She
considered a moment. "Deal. What do you wanna know?"</p><p class="standard">"Do
you know someone named Brian Thompson?"</p><p class="standard">Having
failed to find any chips, Sue settled for Ritz crackers and took them
to the table to sit down, along with the bottle of soda. "Oh, I
see."</p><p class="standard">"So
you've heard what happened to him."</p><p class="standard">"The
teachers tried to keep it quiet, but someone found out and texted
everyone he knew, who texted everyone they knew, who texted everyone
<i>they </i>knew, and pretty soon the whole school had heard. So
you're planning to check it out for your blog?"</p><p class="standard">"Yeah,
that's right," I said, expecting her to make a snide remark
about my blog, but surprisingly, she didn't. "My source didn't
know anything about him, except that he's supposed to be a good kid
and a nice boy who wouldn't hurt a fly."</p><p class="standard">"Brian
was <i>not </i>a nice boy who wouldn't hurt a fly," said Sue.
She got up to get cheese from the refrigerator, and while digging
around, continued, "He was on the football team, thought he was
God's gift to Donner's Rest. I dated him for a while." She
reappeared from the refrigerator with a roll of expensive goat cheese
with herbs; my mother didn't buy things like that, so it was probably
my father's personal stash. "I dumped him, because every
conversation with him turned into a commentary of his greatest
football moments. It was like being stuck in a waiting room with a TV
that plays nothing but ESPN."</p><p class="standard">Sometime
in middle school, Lucy and I had noticed Sue repeating a certain
pattern in her dating life: she would fixate on a boy, start dating
him, then decide he was boring after a while and dump him. By now she
must have worked her way through most of the boys her own age, and
she'd dated a few older and younger boys too. It had always baffled
us. It was one of the things she and Lucy fought about whenever Lucy
was around.</p><p class="standard">"Well,
we can't all be scintillating conversationalists like you," I
said.</p><p class="standard">Sue
stuck her tongue out at me. It was colored orange from the soda she'd
been drinking from the bottle. Spreading goat cheese on her crackers
with a butter knife, she continued speaking. "If anyone was
gonna get the snake in the seat, though, I would've expected it to be
Blake Darnell. Blake and some of the other guys from the football
team sometimes hassle another guy, Kenneth Greeley—geek, video
game freak, you'd love him."</p><p class="standard">"So
Blake Darnell is the main bully," I said.</p><p class="standard">"Yeah.
The other guys, they mostly stand around and egg him on, suggest
things for him to do to Kenneth. Blake's sort of a doofus, so even
though he's good at football, I think the other guys sorta treat him
like a servant. They used to make him wash the jock straps. He stole
Kenneth's boxers in gym constantly." She smirked. "How come
you guys are always doing homo stuff to each other to try and assert
your dominance? I never stole a girl's panties to show her I was
better than her."</p><p class="standard">"You
call me gay all the time, but I've never done anything like that,"
I said. "I'm just as confused by it as you are."</p><p class="standard">She
shrugged and began enjoying her cheese and crackers. "Anyway,
that's everything I have. Two days of no calls to Lucy, and you let
me know when the next Alpha Beta Gamma party is."</p><p class="standard">"A
deal's a deal." I stood up, slung my backpack over my shoulder,
and took my duffel bag and computer case in hand. "But are you
sure you don't want to haggle some more? I got some good information,
you know. I'd be willing to pay three days for it."</p><p class="standard">"I
only took that to make you suffer, but if you're not here, I won't
get to see it, so two days is fine. Have fun at your girlfriend's."</p><p class="standard">Truly,
Sue's information was good, I thought as I left the house and headed
for the bus stop. I now had a possible enemy who might put a King
Cobra in Brian Thompson's front seat to investigate. But I had made
the last remark because I knew a secret about Sue, something I was
pretty sure my parents and Lucy didn't know.</p><p class="standard">It
had been shortly after Lucy left, about four years ago. My dad had
flown to New York with her to visit his brother, the uncle she was
staying with, while my mom stayed here with the rest of us.</p><p class="standard">As
I mentioned, Lucy and Sue fight constantly. They didn't used to; I
remember them being quite close as kids. But around the time Sue
started middle school, she had started picking a fight every time
Lucy spoke to her, so they weren't close like they used to be.
Nowadays, when Lucy comes back for the summer, Sue usually ignores
her for the first few days, then starts making snide remarks about
boyfriends and friends and not being able to drive until they end up
in a full-on catfight. </p><p class="standard">But
that day about four years ago, I happened to walk past Sue's room.
The door was cracked open, and I heard her crying.</p><p class="standard">I
knew at that moment I had two options: to be a good brother and go in
and speak words of comfort for whatever she was crying about,
possibly earning her respect and forging a closer relationship with
my misunderstood middle sister, or to be a creepy weirdo and spy on
her to see if I could figure out why she was crying, then never say
anything unless I needed information to use against her. Being who I
am, I chose the latter.</p><p class="standard">I
had knelt down and peeked through the doorway. I could see her lying
on the bed on her stomach, her face buried in the pillow. I had
waited for a few minutes, trying to hold the noise from my breath
down. At last she sat up, walked over to the desk, and picked
something up. I strained to see what it was.</p><p class="standard">It
was the necklace Lucy had given her for her thirteenth birthday.</p><p class="standard">Sue
stared at it for a minute, her eyes glistening with tears, then put
it in her jewelry box and put the box in the desk drawer. I slunk
away, barely avoiding detection.</p><p class="standard">I
don't know for sure that this little scene meant what I thought.
Maybe she was just remembering Old Yeller, or the <i>Maine</i>, or
Pearl Harbor. But I prefer to think that it meant that Sue misses
Lucy after all.</p><p class="standard">That's
why I didn't believe her when she said she was trying to make me
suffer by taking away Lucy call days. She doesn't have any interest
in making me suffer. She and I almost entirely ignore each other's
existences. We probably haven't spoken since the day she asked me
about Sophia. So I think she's going to call Lucy in my stead. And if
that's the case, I don't mind giving up one more day.</p><p class="standard">I
arrived at Sophia's house.	</p>

    </div><div class="chapter">
      <h2 class="heading"><a id="Chapter_4"><h3 align="CENTER" class="western"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">04</font></h3></a></h2>
      <div class="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard">I
don't know what I was expecting a succubus's house to look like, but
this wasn't it.</p><p class="standard">I
think a lifetime of watching awful vampire movies had conditioned me
to believe that immortal creatures who prey on humans are all hipster
Eurotrash youth who live in Manhattan high-rises and spend their days
asleep and their nights dancing in rave clubs. In the end, the hero
makes a final attack on the rave club full of vampires and kills them
all, making his way down to the crypts beneath the rave club for the
final battle with the lead vampire, a square-jawed pretty boy with
long, greasy dark hair and a permanent five o' clock shadow.</p><p class="standard">Sophia
had dispelled this image in many ways by being a ditz who never
displayed her cleavage, didn't ride a motorcycle, didn't own a trench
coat or a single pair of leather pants, probably danced like a dying
giraffe, and was so out of touch with the rave scene that she didn't
even like <i>Fear and
Loathing in Las Vegas</i>.
But on some level, I had still expected her to live in a Manhattan
high rise.</p><p class="standard">Instead,
I found a modest two-story house, a cottage really, in a quiet
neighborhood of Santa Robles. A low white brick wall surrounded the
lawn, which was a bit overgrown and full of dandelions. The footpath
through the lawn was hemmed in by a marble birdbath and a set of
concrete sculptures of turtles and lizards. </p><p class="standard">This
place was almost as normal as June's place. It definitely didn't look
like it should house a creature of darkness. But Sophia's navy blue
Audi was parked at the curb, so it seemed like I had the right place.
I checked the address against the numbers on the mailbox just to be
sure.</p><p class="standard">I
walked up to the front door and rang the doorbell, and heard Sophia's
voice call "Come in, it's open" from inside.</p><p class="standard">The
door led immediately into a large main room, floored in white tile,
high and open. To the left was the kitchen area. Sophia was in the
middle of cooking; as I came in she dropped a handful of sliced
shallots into a hot pan, then stirred them around with a spatula.
Beyond her I could see a Kitchenaid stand mixer with pasta roller
attachment sitting on the counter; my mother had gotten one from my
father for Christmas a few years ago, and those things weren't cheap.
Also, it was a complete waste to give one to a woman whose idea of
"cooking" is throwing some frozen TV dinners on the counter
and telling everyone to microwave one. A set of gleaming Wusthof
knives lived in a block next to the Kitchenaid, and the pans were all
high-quality stainless steel.</p><p class="standard">"Dinner
will be ready in about half an hour," Sophia said, taking off
her glasses to wipe the steam off them and leaving them on the
counter. "In the meantime, make yourself at home. The room is up
the stairs—" She pointed behind her, down a hallway, "—and
the linen closet is up there too, so if you'd like, grab a towel and
take a bath. Bath's at the end of this hall."</p><p class="standard">"You're
an impeccable hostess," I commented.</p><p class="standard">"I've
never had guests before, so I hope I'm doing everything right."</p><p class="standard">No
wonder my mother thinks of you as a wonder girl. Normally, when
staying with a college student, I'd expect something more along the
lines of "Hey, here's the couch, there's the microwave, don't
eat my Cheetos" for a greeting.</p><p class="standard">I
was tired of holding my bags, so I decided to take her advice, and
went up to the room. There were two doors at the top of the stairs; I
assumed one was Sophia's room and one was the guest room, and took a
guess on the left. The clothes on the floor, however, led me to
believe that this was Sophia's room. I took a glance around before
closing the door. It was lushly carpeted and quite large. Various
antiques hung on the walls and ornamented the shelves; she seemed to
have a small collection of Eugene Delacroix paintings, and a large
framed map of the world that looked hand-drawn hung above the
dresser, next to a pair of wheel lock pistols and a rapier. </p><p class="standard">She's
French, after all, so of course she'd have musketeer weaponry around.</p><p class="standard">I
turned to the door on the right, which must be the guest room. It was
just as lushly carpeted as Sophia's
room, though the walls were unadorned. The double bed, made up with
eighty-dollar comforters and sheets whose thread counts were probably
off the charts, looked like a cloud of comfort. By
comparison, my own bed was purchased from a yard sale and made up
with ratty old sheets that my mother buys from the thrift store, or
else with blankets that my grandmother steals from the convalescent
home she works at and sends to us. Even when those sheets have been
in a freezing closet for six months, you'll get one out and feel a
feverish heat clinging to it.</p><p class="standard">I
placed my duffel bag on top of the oak dresser, got out some fresh
clothes, took off my shoes, and went to get a towel and take a bath.
When I came to the bottom of the stairs, Sophia asked, "How is
it? If there's anything else you need, I can get it."</p><p class="standard">I
rolled my eyes, as Sue had done earlier. "Makes my room look
like a filthy hovel."</p><p class="standard">"The
bathroom's right down there, so go ahead. I put manly soap and
shampoo in there for you."</p><p class="standard">"What's
manly about it?"</p><p class="standard">"The
lack of floral scents or split end-repairing abilities."</p><p class="standard">"As
long as it's not Axe."</p><p class="standard">She
called this a bathroom, right?</p><p class="standard">It
looks more like an ancient Roman bathhouse.</p><p class="standard">The
tub was the size of a Jacuzzi, sunken into the floor, surrounded by
cerulean blue tile. There was a separate washing area with a shower,
and a massage table off in the corner. Clearly, Sophia loved her
baths. I could imagine her settling into this tub with a book after
lighting a few scented candles, a truly luxurious way to clean up.</p><p class="standard">By
contrast, my own house had a leaky shower that was usually willing to
yield only about fifteen minutes' worth of lukewarm water, because my
mother and Sue both take hour-long showers every single day and drain
the entire hot water heater.</p><p class="standard">I
began filling the tub and prepared to spend as much time in here as I
could for the next few days. But before I took my clothes off, I made
sure to lock the door. You never knew when the thought of me naked in
the next room might drive Sophia so wild that she would burst in and
suck all the life force from me.</p><p class="standard">I
soaked in near-boiling water for about thirty minutes, watching the
steam curl into ringlets at the roof, before Sophia knocked on the
door and informed me that dinner was ready.</p><p class="standard">By
now, I was starting to experience an indescribable sort of annoyance.
I was fairly sure what its source was, but I could not see why I
should be feeling it at this moment.</p><p class="standard">Sophia
had once told me that she cooked very simple food which was not
French at all, but that was obviously a lie, because the meal she had
prepared was a dead ringer for some sort of rustic Franco-Provençal
meal, or possibly a peasant meal from the Italian Alps. Blanched kale
with pine nuts, pasta dressed simply with olive oil and capers,
gnocchi, ragout, and a loaf of crusty French bread all sat on the
table amid a place setting that was understated, but would do Martha
Stewart proud. </p><p class="standard">Despite
my annoyance, I had to try this.</p><p class="standard">It
was good.</p><p class="standard">Every
bit of it was at or beyond the level of the best thing I had ever
eaten.</p><p class="standard">That
somehow increased my annoyance.</p><p class="standard">"You're
being unusually quiet. How is it?" Sophia asked after a minute.</p><p class="standard">"This
kale is good," I said. "Where'd you buy it?"</p><p class="standard">"I
bought everything at Whole Foods," she replied. "It's all
organic and so on." She smiled. "What we ate before
industrialized agriculture was organic too, but it was usually full
of organic insects and organic bacteria." She got up from the
table and came back with two glasses and a bottle of wine. "Here,
have some wine too." She twisted in the corkscrew and yanked out
the cork, then poured me a glass of dry white. "I can't
guarantee it goes with the food, though. I just told the guy at the
wine shop what I was making and bought what he recommended."</p><p class="standard">"You
bought the sommelier's recommendation?"</p><p class="standard">"Please
don't feel like you have to drink it if it's not good."</p><p class="standard">"No,
I mean, you shopped at a place with a sommelier?"</p><p class="standard">"Is
that weird?"</p><p class="standard">"I
guess if you're Giada de Laurentiis, then no, it's not."</p><p class="standard">I
tasted the wine. Of course, it was better than any wine I had ever
tasted.</p><p class="standard">Sophia
ate daintily, but she seemed to eat quite a lot; even though she'd
made enough food for four people, most of it was gone by the time the
meal was wrapping up.</p><p class="standard">"Do
you eat like this every night?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"No,
most nights I would make something simpler, but tonight's sort of
special, so I made a fancier meal," she replied.</p><p class="standard">"I
see." My irritation just kept increasing.</p><p class="standard">At
that moment, a grey Manx cat padded in from the living room, his
stubby tail swishing. Sophia beckoned him over, but he ignored her
and came to me, rubbing against my leg and purring.</p><p class="standard">"Seems
Pascal likes you better than he likes me," she said,
disappointed.</p><p class="standard">That
was the last straw.</p><p class="standard">If
you ask me why that was the last straw, I really couldn't tell you.
After all, my irritation was totally unreasonable and irrational from
the beginning, so it only makes sense that it would be totally
irrational and unreasonable to the end. So for that reason, I cannot
tell you why it was the last straw that Sophia's cat came in and
turned out to be the only cat I've ever known who immediately took to
me, just as Sophia was the only succubus I've ever known who
immediately took to me. It just was.</p><p class="standard">"What
are you so disappointed about?" I snapped. "With your
perfect house, perfect car, perfect phone, perfect cat, perfect life.
How can you even live like this? You're an infernal creature! Why is
everything you own so nice?"</p><p class="standard">Seldom
do I regret saying something, but I regretted saying that. Sophia was
startled, looking at me with confusion over my outburst from nowhere.
Only she, however, could have reacted the way she did. Rather than
kick me out of her house or snap at me back for being an ingrate, she
instead took her phone out of her pocket. "Do you want my phone,
then?"</p><p class="standard">I
took the phone from her hand. Even though I already regretted what
I'd said, I was sorely tempted.</p><p class="standard">"No,
I couldn't afford the plan." I gave the phone back. </p><p class="standard">She
put the phone away, picked up Pascal, and said, "Do you want my
cat?"</p><p class="standard">"No!
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I'm acting
like this. I'm grateful to you for letting me stay here. I think
maybe I should just go to bed."</p><p class="standard">"That's
right, you must be tired. How thoughtless of me, keeping you up like
this," Sophia replied with a smile.</p><p class="standard">Even
her smile was perfect.</p>

online. </p><p class="standard">The
first thing I got was the Jerry Rice High football team's Facebook
page. The first thing I noticed was that these guys fought like
little kids. Every single post was one of them tooting his own horn
about that great pass he made, or that great kick he took, or that
great tackle he did. Then the other guys would come in and start a
pissing contest over who was the best, over who had really won the
game for the school. </p><p class="standard">In
particular, Blake Darnell and Brian Thompson seemed to have a
constant battle going over who was the backbone of the team, who was
really responsible for winning all the games. They got pretty nasty
about it, too, and as Sue had pointed out, it often looked like there
was unresolved sexual tension between them, especially when Brian
insulted Blake's penis size and Blake threatened to anally rape Brian
in the locker room to prove how wrong Brian was about his penis size.</p><p class="standard">When
I woke up the next morning, I didn't want to go downstairs. In fact,
I seriously considered climbing out the window and sneaking away.</p><p class="standard">Sophia
being how she was, I was sure she'd be gracious about what an ass I
was last night and not mention it, but that wouldn't actually make it
go away. It was one thing to be a jerk when we were at school, but to
come into her house and take advantage of her hospitality, then be a
jerk like that, was too much even for a shameless person like me. But
I couldn't stay in bed forever, and the drop from that window looked
pretty steep, so I eventually dressed myself and went downstairs.</p><p class="standard">"Good
morning," said Sophia. She was cooking again. "How'd you
sleep?"</p><p class="standard">"Good,"
I answered. "About last night..."</p><p class="standard">"No
need to apologize again. You were tired. I've already forgotten about
it," she said with a friendly smile.</p><p class="standard">I
couldn't look at her. Even though she was a demon, her angelic smile
shined too brightly. I wanted to shake her and ask what was wrong
with her, why she did so much for a worthless loser like me who was
so worthless that his own mother wouldn't even do as much for him as
she had. </p><p class="standard">"What
are you making?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"Classified
information."</p><p class="standard">"Don't
try to use that joke again."</p><p class="standard">"It's
mixed fruit, waffles, hash browns, and sausages. There's coffee over
there if you want some, too."</p><p class="standard">Of
course, Sophia's coffee maker wasn't filled with that dirt they sell
in the big cans, pre-ground; it was some sort of fancy blend of
medium-roast beans that she'd ground herself. I poured myself a cup
and, as predicted, it was some of the best coffee I'd ever had. The
breakfast was amazing too. It seems unfair for one girl to be
attractive, intelligent, pleasant, and a great cook all at once, even
if these gifts are all balanced with one huge caveat.</p><p class="standard">As
we ate, I somehow ended up telling Sophia about Brian Thompson's
murder and about the leads I had gotten from Sue. But when I glanced
up at the clock and said, "And with that, I depart," and
Sophia asked where I was going, she wasn't very satisfied with my
answer "I'm going to ditch Latrom and whoever that guy teaching
math is and go investigate Blake Darnell and Kenneth Greeley"
and chewed me out for trying to skip class when I'd gotten myself
exiled from home for failing every midterm.</p><p class="standard">Well,
this is Sophia, so "chewed me out" isn't a very accurate
description. The conversation actually went more like this:</p><p class="standard">"Oh,
I don't know if that's such a good idea. You did fail every midterm
and get yourself exiled from your house, so maybe it would be a good
idea to go to class and listen to the instructors?"</p><p class="standard">"If
you talk to me like a kindergarten teacher by using a questioning
tone for things that you're not really questioning, I'm going to
respond like a kindergarten student."</p><p class="standard">"You
always act like a kindergarten student."</p><p class="standard">"You
smell bad."</p><p class="standard">"What?!"</p><p class="standard">She
immediately sniffed her shirt sleeve, pulled around a strand of hair
and sniffed it, breathed into her hand and sniffed it.</p><p class="standard">"I
do not!"</p><p class="standard">"You're
dumb and ugly."</p><p class="standard">"You
<i>are </i>coming to school with me.
If that's how you want to be, I'll use my charm on you."</p><p class="standard">I
waited a moment for her to do something, but she just stared at me. I
got up and poured myself another cup of coffee, still waiting.
"Weren't you going to use your charm on me?"</p><p class="standard">Sophia
looked confused. "That's strange, with all the pheromones I
released just now, you should be near to raping me."</p><p class="standard">"You
talk so casually about being raped!"</p><p class="standard">"Oh,
everyone who ever raped me ended up a lot more sorry it happened than
I did," she replied, beaming angelically.</p><p class="standard">"You
talk so casually about being raped multiple times, with such a nice
smile!"</p><p class="standard">"It
really wasn't such a big deal," she replied, beaming angelically
once again.</p><p class="standard">"Could
it be that you enjoy being raped?"</p><p class="standard">"It
does make things easier for me."</p><p class="standard">"How
terrible! You're a terrible, awful creature! Now that I think about
it, it was terrible and awful of you to try and make me come to the
edge of raping you just so I would go to class! Do you know what I'd
look like after I was done raping you? The doctor can't reattach
things when there's neither anything to reattach nor anything to
reattach it to! You're a terrible, awful creature!"</p><p class="standard">"Oh
stop, you flatterer," she said with a titter and a wave of her
hand.</p><p class="standard">"That
wasn't a compliment!"</p><p class="standard">"But
I really am at a loss to explain why you haven't pushed me down yet.
It only took a fraction of this to enamor JZ and his men that time.
Can you smell anything?"</p><p class="standard">I
sniffed the air. "I smell coffee. I smell breakfast. I smell
money. I smell sin and ill intentions. I smell fire and brimstone."</p><p class="standard">"You
need to get your nose checked. There's definitely no brimstone around
here, and any sin or ill intentions are coming from you."</p><p class="standard">"I
smell cat box."</p><p class="standard">"Pascal
goes outside to use the bathroom."</p><p class="standard">I
shrugged. "I really don't smell anything."</p><p class="standard">Sophia
got out of her chair. "Then, if I can't use my charm, I'll have
to use my last resort." She took me by the arm. "I'll drag
you to school if I have to."</p><p class="standard">I
struggled a little bit, but not seriously. Sophia wasn't exactly
weedy, but she didn't look muscular either; she had sort of a soft,
voluptuous air to her. Nonetheless, her grip strength was
unbelievable—she could probably break one of those arcade
machines that tests your grip strength—so I knew I had no
chance of escaping, and with a sigh of resignation, I accompanied her
to class.</p><p class="standard">Today,
Latrom was lecturing on Samuel Johnson's "Idler No. 34" and
how it showed the revered Dr. Johnson to be nothing but a puffed up
government bureaucrat living on the theft of money from hardworking
businessmen, idling away his life at idleness. For myself, I idled
away the time at drawing the best rendition of Shinobu Maehara that I
could manage in my notebook. My drawing skills are minimal at best,
so the end result wasn't terribly impressive, but I still felt I had
passed the lecture more productively than if I had listened to it.</p><p class="standard">After
Latrom, we had math. Our professor was red-faced, was fooling no one
with the tufts of hair he'd combed over his bald pate, and was quite
excitable, always dancing back and forth in front of the chalk boards
as he screamed about the wonders of pre-calculus, but despite all
this, I could never make his name stick in my mind. Mar-something.
Marbury, or Marcus, something like that. Of course, if I couldn't
make the man's name stick in my mind, I definitely couldn't make what
he was saying stick in my mind, so I spent the whole lecture miming
his manic movements at Sophia whenever he had his back turned to
write on the board. Sophia would laugh, then catch herself and shake
her head disapprovingly every time she saw me doing it.</p><p class="standard">Finally,
class was over, and I'd have to hurry if I wanted to get to Jerry
Rice in time to catch Blake Darnell and Kenneth Greeley. Standing
next to Sophia's car, I thought for a minute about the best way to
find them once I got there. Direct search was unlikely to turn them
up before they left the school, so I needed to ask someone. A teacher
seemed like a good choice. Unfortunately, I had attended class so
sparingly when I was at Jerry Rice that it was unlikely that any of
the teachers remembered me.</p><p class="standard">"What's
wrong?" Sophia asked. "Get in the car, and let's go home."</p><p class="standard">"Give
me your phone," I said.</p><p class="standard">Most
people, in this situation, would ask why, then possibly hand the
phone over; Sophia did it in the reverse order. What a sap.</p><p class="standard">"I'm
not going home," I responded to her out-of-order question as I
used her phone to get on the Internet and go to Jerry Rice High's
homepage to look up the phone number.</p><p class="standard">"Oh,
that's right, your investigation. Do you want me to drive you there?"</p><p class="standard">"That's
all right." I found the number I was looking for and committed
it to memory, then handed Sophia's phone back to her. "Oh,
before you go, you're the resident expert on weird stuff. Is there
any sort of snake monster out there that puts snakes into the front
seats of high school students' cars?"</p><p class="standard">"Classified
information."</p><p class="standard">"Fine,
get outta here." I watched her car leave the parking lot, then
headed for a bus stop.</p><p class="standard">I
didn't really expect any of the teachers to remember me, but there
was one person who was probably still at the school and might
remember me. I dialed the number of the front office on my own cell
phone and asked if that person could come to the phone.</p><p class="standard">"He's
busy," the office bitch responded. I didn't think she was really
trying to save his work from unnecessary interruption; it was
probably more like, <i>I'm not going to go look for him</i>.</p><p class="standard">However,
with much wheedling, I managed to get her to tell me that he was
currently cleaning the third PE shed and I should look for him there.</p><p class="standard">It
made me wonder if she remembered me. I'd been dragged up to the
office in a drunken stupor more than once while I was at that school.</p><p class="standard">One
time I became fixated on the word 'knickers' and decided to write it
all over the door to someone's office in permanent marker. I wonder
if that was her.</p><p class="standard">Jerry
Rice High School hadn't changed at all since I'd left. There was
still the same scuzzy brown main office. Still the same collection of
flimsy mobile home classrooms that would heat up like an oven inside
during the summer heat. Still the same assortment of ghetto and
backwoods teenagers, all trying to act hip, modern, and like they'd
never eaten raccoon roadkill for dinner. School was just getting out,
so the students were swarming all over the place, making an ungodly
racket as they left for the mall. A few of them gave me distasteful
looks, looks that said <i>You don't belong here—why don't you
just die?</i>, just like in the good old days.</p><p class="standard">I
crossed the campus towards the field, where the third PE shed was.
The PE sheds were on a line that crossed center field; the closest
one to the field was the first PE shed, and they ran away from the
field up to the fifth. Each was a dilapidated wooden building covered
in chips of ancient paint, with corrugated aluminum roofs. Although
anyone who wanted to break in could probably punch through the door,
they were kept locked, some of them with old, rusty padlocks scarred
by many seasons of rain, and others by shiny new combination locks.</p><p class="standard">The
person I was looking for was the janitor, Big Steve. I never got him
to tell me how he got the name; he wasn't particularly big, but he
also wasn't particularly small, so it wasn't an ironic nickname. He
was particularly alcoholic and particularly potheaded; the irregular
ages of the locks were due to his habit of misplacing his keys or
forgetting the combination, cutting the lock off with bolt cutters,
and getting a new one. He was also a particularly good source of
booze and scam ideas for an impressionable young boy just out of
Catholic school.</p><p class="standard">I
came to the third PE shed. Sure enough, the cut lock was lying on the
ground next to a pair of bolt cutters. I knocked on the rotted wooden
door and called "Big Steve!".</p><p class="standard">Steve
appeared at the door, his coveralls as filthy as ever, his mullet as
choppy as ever, his eyes as bloodshot as ever, and his five o' clock
shadow as unshaven as ever. "Eh? Who're you?"</p><p class="standard">"James
Moran," I said. "Do you remember me?"</p><p class="standard">Big
Steve squinted at me, rubbed his eyes, turned around and scratched
his neck. "Yeah, I remember you. Whatchu doin' here? Thought you
went off to Chico State or somethin'."</p><p class="standard">In
Steve's mind, Chico State was a top-grade school. His cousin, who was
"smarter 'n' shit", had gone there and then gotten a "good
job" as the field manager on a walnut farm, making peanuts for
standing in the blazing sun all day. I once told Steve almost every
human was in fact smarter than shit, but he was too drunk to care at
the time. Sadly, I was now at a college that made Chico State look
like Harvard, so I wasn't in any position to mock him anymore.</p><p class="standard">"I
heard somebody died, in a weird way," I said. "I came to
find out if you know anything about it."</p><p class="standard">"You
must be talkin' 'bout Brian Thompson."</p><p class="standard">"Yeah."</p><p class="standard">"Want
my opinion, them black kids on the football team killed him."</p><p class="standard">Blake
was a "black kid", as I'd discovered on Facebook last
night, and he'd definitely had a rivalry going with Brian.</p><p class="standard">"A
while back, I heard that Thompson boy in the locker room pickin' a
fight with them black kids, callin' 'em niggers, whatever. Them black
kids got mad, and a fight started, everyone punchin' each other, 'til
that coach of theirs came in an' stopped it," Steve continued.
"Course, no one ever breathed a word 'bout it. Whole school'd be
tore up if the football team couldn't play cuz the quarterback
started a gang war."</p><p class="standard">"Do
you know where I can find Blake Darnell?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"No
practice today, so I'd guess he's goin' home. Couldn't tell ya where
that is."</p><p class="standard">I
knew—from the Internet—so I didn't need him to tell me.
"What about Kenneth Greeley?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">Steve
blinked, surprised. "Who?"</p><p class="standard">"Never
mind. Thanks."</p><p class="standard">"Hey,
you wanna come in for a hit? I got some crystal here, real good
stuff."</p><p class="standard">Apparently
alcohol wasn't strong enough for him anymore. "No, thanks. I
quit that stuff a while ago."</p><p class="standard">"Didja?
Good for you. You're too young to be like me."</p><p class="standard">I
left Big Steve to enjoy his crystal in the third PE shed and thought
about what to do next. From what Big Steve said, it sounded like the
black members of the football team had enough reason to want to kill
Brian, so it might not be necessary to look any further.</p><p class="standard">Rural
areas of northern California have very few black people. When I was
here as a student, there were only two or three black kids. At the
Catholic school there hadn't been any. So usually they tried to keep
their heads down and stay out of trouble, at least any kind of
trouble where their only allies would be other black kids. I'd once
heard some white trash kid here say "I think niggers should
still be our slaves", and no one had ever shanked him in
retaliation.</p><p class="standard">But
these guys were high and mighty football stars.</p><p class="standard">Still,
I wondered why they would draw attention to themselves by killing
Brian with a King Cobra. </p><p class="standard">It
seemed so unnecessary.</p><p class="standard">I
headed away from the school in the direction of Blake's house, trying
to catch a glimpse of him among the groups of teenagers walking along
the sidewalk. If he drove to school, I was out of luck for today, but
it wasn't very far from here to his house, and he was a big football
guy who could handle a little walking.</p><p class="standard">I
found him alone at a railroad crossing. The gates had lowered and the
bells were ringing the approach of a train. </p><p class="standard">"Excuse
me, Blake Darnell?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">Blake
turned around, a six-foot five, two hundred and fifty pound teenager
wearing an NFL jersey (I didn't know which team's) and sweats, and
glared at me, his eyes narrowing in a face like carved black ivory. I
stopped, not sure I wanted to get any closer to such a large and
apparently hostile person.</p><p class="standard">"Yeah,
that's me," he said. "What about it?"</p><p class="standard">"I'd
like to ask you some questions about Brian Thompson. I hear you
didn't get along with him."</p><p class="standard">Blake's
face suddenly erupted with rage, his teeth bared at me like a savage
dog. "I don't wanna answer no questions about Brian Thompson,
that cracker," he snarled. "Go away. You come near me, I'm
gonna shove it in yo' ass so hard you gonna split in half!"</p><p class="standard">"Okay,
okay, easy," I said, holding my hands up in surrender. "I'm
leaving."</p><p class="standard">I
left Blake and headed back towards the school, hoping that I hadn't
lost my chance to find Kenneth. Even putting aside his fixation on
the asses of other men, Blake's reaction was so suspicious,
especially after his history with Brian, that I probably didn't need
to look any further to find Brian's killer, but in the interest of
completeness, I was going to find Kenneth anyway. </p><p class="standard">Kenneth
lived in the opposite direction from Blake, so I ran back to the
school as fast as I could, stopping to huff and puff and grab at my
chest every few minutes, and then set off at a dragging walk in the
direction of Kenneth's house. This route led through the miserably
small downtown area of Donner's Rest, lined with fast food
restaurants and dive bars. I wondered idly if Sophia had ever come
down this way looking for snacks. </p><p class="standard">As
I passed Pizza Hut, I happened to see Kenneth inside—at least,
I hoped it was him—eating a pizza by himself in a booth next to
the window. A gaunt, pale teenager with messy black hair and acne,
wearing a Warhammer 40K T-shirt—he looked like the pictures on
his Facebook page, and the whole page was covered with links to
Warhammer 40K sites and newsgroups. I knew nothing about the game
other than the name and that its players laughed at D&amp;D players
in a way that I found extraordinarily similar to a pot calling a
kettle black. Come to think of it, I didn't know much about D&amp;D
either—you need friends to play tabletop games.</p><p class="standard">I
went inside and came up to his table. Kenneth stared up at me warily.
It wasn't quite the <i>Go die, outsider </i>sort of look I'd been
getting at the school; it was more like he was afraid I was going to
beat him up and wondering if he should hit me in the crotch with the
napkin dispenser and run away before I could do it.</p><p class="standard">"Are
you Kenneth Greeley?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"Yes,"
he answered, squinting and moving away from me slightly.</p><p class="standard">"I'm
James Moran. I write a local news blog. I just want to ask you a few
questions about Brian Thompson's death, if that's okay."</p><p class="standard">"Uh,
okay, I guess."</p><p class="standard">"Can
I sit down?"</p><p class="standard">"Yeah."
Kenneth pulled his pitcher of soda over to his side of the table, and
I sat down across from him. "Um, have some pizza if you want."</p><p class="standard">"Sure,
don't mind if I do." I took a piece, just to be friendly. When
it was gone, I took another piece. Had Pizza Hut always been this
awful? It was all Sophia's fault; she was ruining me with all that
fancy food.</p><p class="standard">"I
know it's not, like, an uncommon name or anything, but could you be
related to Sue Moran?" Kenneth asked, fiddling with his straw
and not looking at me.</p><p class="standard">"She's
my sister," I said.</p><p class="standard">"Well,
uh, we sort of went out for a while, and..."</p><p class="standard">"Did
she dump you?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"Yeah...She
never told me why. You don't, uh, know something?"</p><p class="standard">I
took a napkin and wiped my mouth. "No, we don't talk much."</p><p class="standard">Kenneth
fiddled with his straw some more, then poured himself another glass
of soda. Was he one of those caffeine freak gamers who packs away
gallons of Mountain Dew? It seemed odd to order a whole pitcher of
soda for yourself.</p><p class="standard">"Oh.
Uh, so what did you want to know about Brian?"</p><p class="standard">"I
hear that you knew him, and that you two didn't get along very well.
I heard he bullied you."</p><p class="standard">Kenneth
drained his glass of soda in one continuous suck on the straw.
"That's not really it. Brian's okay. My parents and his parents
are in the same gun club, so we've known each other since we were
kids. He used to play some jokes on me, but nothing since we started
high school. The only one who's ever given me a hard time in high
school is that Blake guy from the football team, and all buddies."</p><p class="standard">That
went with what Sue had told me—that Blake was the main bully.
"So if, hypothetically, you could make anyone disappear, it
would be Blake, not Brian."</p><p class="standard">Kenneth
poured himself another glass of soda and took another piece of pizza.
"Maybe I'd like to see Blake get some back, but I'm not dumb
enough to go killing anyone. I know if I make it another two years
I'll never have to see any of these guys again."</p><p class="standard">"Who
do you think killed Brian?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"Blake."
It was instantaneous—none of the hemming and hawing he'd done
with every other reply he'd made. </p><p class="standard">"Why?"</p><p class="standard">"Brian
told me—Blake was jealous of him, because he was the ace of the
football team and Blake wasn't. Blake thought he should be
quarterback. And Blake, I wouldn't be surprised if he's dumb enough
to go and kill someone over that; he's not real smart."</p><p class="standard">"I
got that impression." I stood up. "I guess that's what I
wanted to know. Sorry for bothering you, and thanks for the pizza."</p><p class="standard">"Wait—you're
Sue's brother, so, so d'you think—d'you think maybe you could
ask her about me? Like, if she'd ever consider coming back to me? I
know she probably dumped me 'cause I'm a dork and she's pretty and
popular, but..."</p><p class="standard">His
words were saying one thing, but when I looked into his eyes, they
didn't agree. They almost seemed to be sneering at me, almost mocking
me for even thinking about believing what his words were telling me.
I decided it had to be my imagination.</p><p class="standard">"I
don't think Sue cares about things like that," I said, although
I had absolutely no basis for saying so. Truthfully, I had no idea
why she constantly broke up with her boyfriends and found new ones.
For all I knew, she was trying to find the one with the best chance
of becoming a millionaire so she could marry him and never have to
work. </p><p class="standard">"Then,
is it possible she might come back to me?"</p><p class="standard">I
thought about whether such a thing had ever happened. I was pretty
sure it hadn't. Some girls keep getting with the same guy even though
he's a loser, then leaving him because he's a loser, and then coming
back to him. Sue was like the opposite of that; she had dated guys
that most girls would have hung on to like lampreys, and had then
dumped them for no apparent reason.</p><p class="standard">"Probably
not," I admitted. "Don't worry, it's not you. She does that
constantly. It doesn't seem to matter what sort of guy it is, she
eventually finds some reason to dump him and moves on. I wouldn't
worry about it if I were you. You can probably do better than someone
who drinks soda from a two-liter bottle while standing with the
refrigerator open and her belly hanging out of a shirt that she won't
admit she grew out of six years ago."</p><p class="standard">N.B.,
I was not being cruel to Sue; even though we don't always get along,
and even though I don't understand her dating habits at all, she's
still my sister. I was genuinely trying to convince Kenneth to give
up on her. I think most women would agree that I'm a pretty creepy
guy, so I know it when I see it, and there had been a creepy sort of
avidity in Kenneth's eyes when he talked about Sue coming back to
him. I didn't think he was a murderer, and I had some sympathy for
his plight when it came to my hard-to-understand sister; but at the
same time, I somehow felt that I didn't want her associating with him
too much.</p><p class="standard">In
the end, I think it was the Warhammer T-shirt.</p>
      </div>
    </div><div class="chapter">
      <h2 class="heading"><a id="Chapter_6"></a></h2>
      <div class="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard">There
was no question in my mind about who had the most motive to kill
Brian out of the known suspects. But that wasn't really the issue
here.</p><p class="standard">If
Brian had been shot or beaten to death or run over, I'd point the
finger at Blake for sure. This area being how it is, we might have
even been able to drum up some old-fashioned mob justice and gotten
Blake hung from a lamppost. There was just one problem.</p><p class="standard">Brian
had been attacked by a King Cobra.</p><p class="standard">Or
maybe that was just the rumor mill in action.</p><p class="standard">The
next morning, a Saturday, I read every report on Brian's death that I
could find on the Internet. I also watched what the local news
stations had said the night after it happened. Most of them had
treated it as a big joke, making every snake pun in the book over the
course of an excruciating few minutes. They interviewed Brian's
parents and a few of his other acquaintances; one station's reporter
had asked them right to their faces if Brian had pissed off any
flute-playing Hindu kids, and Brian's father, a chunky middle-aged
white guy with his thinning blonde hair in a crew cut, had angrily
shut the door in the reporter's face and screamed at him to, to put
it politely, go sodomize himself with a snake. 
</p><p class="standard">So it
seemed that the snake was not the product of the rumor mill, which
led me back to my original question: if Blake had killed Brian, how
and why had he gotten a King Cobra to do it with?</p><p class="standard">I went
downstairs and found a note from Sophia on the refrigerator. My
breakfast was in the refrigerator and she would be back before noon,
it said. I got out the breakfast and heated it, ate it, then went to
the living room and called Lucy while Pascal sat in my lap, purring.</p><p class="standard">"James?
I thought you had some kind of pact with Sue not to call me for two
days, or something?" said Lucy when she picked up.</p><p class="standard">"I
couldn't bear to be away from the glow of your voice, my darling,"
I cooed.</p><p class="standard">"Don't
coo at me! Your voice grates on me like the sound of a million and
one pigeons in a million pigeonholes, and that goes double when you
coo like one. So, I hear that Mom threw you out of the house for a
while and you're staying with your friend...what was her name?
Stella? Sonia?"</p><p class="standard">"Sophia,"
I said. "I assume Sue told you."</p><p class="standard">"Yeah.
I was really surprised when she called me. I almost didn't know what
to say."</p><p class="standard">"You
didn't know what to say at all, did you?"</p><p class="standard">"Yeah,"
Lucy admitted.</p><p class="standard">"To
the bitter end, right up to goodbye, you had no idea what to say,
didn't you?"</p><p class="standard">"Yeah,"
Lucy admitted.</p><p class="standard">"Sue
did all the talking, didn't she?"</p><p class="standard">"Yeah,"
Lucy admitted.</p><p class="standard">"You
realized that you're madly in love with me and want to spend your
life with no other man, didn't you?"</p><p class="standard">"Who
would realize such a creepy thing?!"</p><p class="standard">"Lucy,
what do you say if neither of us is married by the time you're
twenty-five, the two of us get married?"</p><p class="standard">"So
you're not even giving me until thirty? You think my case is that
hopeless? And before that, isn't that illegal?"</p><p class="standard">"I
know there's somewhere in this world our love can flourish!"</p><p class="standard">"If
I weren't on the other side of the country from you right now, I'd
turn you in for sexual assault."</p><p class="standard">"Speaking
of sexual assault..." I started telling her about the case,
beginning with Blake's bizarre habit of threatening to anally rape
other men.</p><p class="standard">"Now
that's something I'd pay to see," Lucy said when I told her
about my encounter with Blake by the train tracks.</p><p class="standard">"Really?
You love me so much that you'd get off at the sight of me being
anally raped by another man?" I squealed with delight. "I
knew you loved me after all!"</p><p class="standard">"Eww,
no! Just—just shut the hell up and keep going. I can't believe
a woman can say she'd like to see you get raped by another man and
you still manage to interpret it as a declaration of love."</p><p class="standard">I
finished my story and asked Lucy her opinion on all of this. "I
just can't see how or why Blake would get a King Cobra to kill
Brian," I said, "but I can't see anyone doing that unless
they had a personal grudge against Brian."</p><p class="standard">"I
don't know—couldn't it be some kind of serial killer with a
snake fetish, or something?" Lucy suggested.</p><p class="standard">"Maybe
if I was Clarice Starling, or Batman."</p><p class="standard">"And
what about that other boy, Kenneth?"</p><p class="standard">"I
think we can dismiss him," I said.</p><p class="standard">"Are
you sure?"</p><p class="standard">"Pretty
sure."</p><p class="standard">"It's
just, I'm thinking of Amber."</p><p class="standard">Amber,
if you recall, dear reader, was the trailer park strumpet who
convinced me she was the innocent victim of molestation by the pastor
Joseph Austen, actually an incubus. She really wasn't. Well, maybe
she was at one point, but when I met her, she was already
manipulative and homicidal, acting alternately innocent and sensual
as necessary to achieve her ends. Also, she's a real life pedomorphic
loli. I can't forgive someone like that for being evil when she
should be a lovable childlike teacher who dresses in pink and
sparkles but actually lives in a room full of beer cans and cigarette
butts.</p><p class="standard">"Kenneth
may have less apparent motive to kill Brian than Blake does, but
don't forget that Sue told you Brian was bullying him, and he himself
told you Brian wasn't, after he already knew you were investigating
the murder. Also, you said he seemed smart. A smart person could
realize that killing Brian with some insane method like putting a
snake in his car could make it harder to pin him down as the
murderer. And a smart person could find that snake if he needed it."</p><p class="standard">"You're
right," I admitted. "Maybe he was hoping the police would
go with the snake-themed serial killer theory and there wouldn't be
any pressure on him."</p><p class="standard">It
pains me to say it, but our local cops are pretty stupid.</p><p class="standard">At
that moment, Sophia came through the door, so I asked Lucy to hold on
a second. "Where did you go so early in the morning?" I
asked. "I thought your kind hated the sunrise."</p><p class="standard">"I
just went to visit some of the older people in the neighborhood,"
Sophia replied as she got the things out to make herself coffee. "I
help them out with housework, and chat with them a little so they
won't be as lonely. We remember a lot of the same things, so it's
fun."</p><p class="standard">"What
kind of an excuse for an infernal creature are you? I'm totally
disgusted with you right now."</p><p class="standard">Oops.</p><p class="standard">Lucy,
a normal mortal who knew nothing at all about the world of darkness I
had entered, was still on the line, listening as we talked about
infernal creatures and remembering the fifties.</p><p class="standard">"Ah,
Lucy, I just meant that, ah, Sophia used to be a goth when she was
younger, and dress up in black and claim she was an infernal creature
of the night."</p><p class="standard">"Okay.
You don't have to explain to me."</p><p class="standard">"Is
that Lucy?" Sophia asked. "Lemme, lemme!" She twisted
the phone out of my grasp with her freakish strength and put it on
speaker. "Lucy? This is Sophia, James's friend. He's told me so
much about you, and I've wanted to meet you—"</p><p class="standard">"It
was all lies," Lucy interrupted.</p><p class="standard">"Pardon?"</p><p class="standard">"Everything
James said about me was a lie. He lies with every word, that hoary
cripple, with a perverted eye."</p><p class="standard">"He
only told me you were a fantastic student, mature, athletic, and that
he values your advice very much," Sophia said.</p><p class="standard">"Those
were all lies. I'm a terrible student. I'm so dumb, he helps me,
'cause my grades are even worse than his. And I'm immature. I collect
Beanie Babies and cat purses. I'm totally out of shape; if I take the
stairs, I'm out of breath, even if it's just the front steps at the
library. And my advice is usually awful. I often advise him to call a
psychic hotline rather than listen to me. All true. Everything he
said, says, and will say is a lie."</p><p class="standard">"It's
not a lie that you kissed me on the lips when you were twelve,"
I said.</p><p class="standard">The
room was silent, but for the low hiss of static on a cheap cell phone
speaker. "I...I...I just wanted to know what it felt like,"
Lucy finally stammered. "It didn't mean anything...It's just
that I had never kissed a boy before, and I was young, and curious,
and...Anyway, it was nice talking to you, Sophia, okay, see you
later!" The line cut off.</p><p class="standard">Sophia
handed the phone back to me. "What is the deal with you and
her?" she asked. "Are you two really...like that?"</p><p class="standard">"Classified
information," I replied. 
</p><p class="standard">A
moment passed. 
</p><p class="standard">"Yes,
we totally are."</p><p class="standard">"So
you want to sleep with her?"</p><p class="standard">"Eww,
no! She's my sister! Gross! What kind of sick, twisted, grotesque,
perverted creature are you? When I said Lucy and I were totally like
that, I meant we're totally a pair of siblings with a good
relationship who love each other in a completely platonic and chaste
fashion!"</p><p class="standard">"Well,
she seems like a nice person," said Sophia, smiling, "Exactly
like I'd imagine your sister to be. I'd like to meet her sometime."</p><p class="standard">I
shook my head sadly. "A succubus who cooks nice dinners for a
friend, owns a nice cat, helps old people around the neighborhood,
and engages in humorous interplay with younger girls...Have you
realized that you're an absolute failure as a succubus? Morrigan from
Darkstalkers would never go around the neighborhood chatting with the
elderly. Does Satan know you're doing this, and does he approve?"</p><p class="standard">"If
Satan exists, I've never heard from him, so it must be okay,"
Sophia answered, sitting down in the chair across from me and trying
to lure Pascal away from me to her lap. Pascal ignored her.</p><p class="standard">"I
guess I don't even have to ask; I'm pretty sure that he who made the
lamb made thee," I said.</p><p class="standard">Sophia
suddenly became morose and started staring off into the distance
pensively. If she had been wearing something nice, it might have been
very picturesque, but she was wearing tattered jeans and had her hair
pulled back by a white headband that looked like something out of an
exercise video from the early 90s, so the effect was ruined.</p><p class="standard">"I'm
going to go study," she said, standing up. "I suggest you
do the same."</p><p class="standard">"I
guess so," I agreed.</p><p class="standard">"Ask
me if there's anything you don't understand, okay?"</p><p class="standard">"I
will."</p><p class="standard">I
would have preferred to study together, at the table, since I
expected to not understand almost everything, but it seemed plain
that for whatever odd reason, she wanted to be alone, so I let her go
to her room and study alone while I took my own work to the kitchen
table.</p><p class="standard">I
genuinely tried to study, at least for the first ten minutes or so.
It wasn't so bad when I was reading about the math, but when I
started trying to do the problems, that was when my eyes just glazed
over. They became like pottery, coated in a thick layer of primer,
hardened by hours of heat in the kiln of boredom that was fifty
copies of the same problem with the numbers tweaked a little. I took
a break every sixty seconds, hoping to clear my mind enough to make
some progress, but as soon as my break was done and it was time to
get back to work, my mind suddenly needed clearing again. 
</p><p class="standard">I had
finally given up on math and moved on to economics, and was
considering scratching my own eyes out, when my cell phone rang.</p><p class="standard">June
Sullivan.</p><p class="standard">Wondering
if she had something new to tell me about Brian's case, I picked up.</p><p class="standard">"James,"
came her sultry voice.</p><p class="standard">"June,"
I replied.</p><p class="standard">"Can
you guess what I'm wearing right now, James?"</p><p class="standard">"Jeans
and your favorite Powerpuff Girls T-shirt?"</p><p class="standard">June
chuckled, the low, throaty chuckle of an adult woman that you reach
by calling 1-900-some part of the human anatomy or activity involving
that part of the anatomy. "I'm sorry, I couldn't resist playing
with you, but the fact of the matter is that this is serious
business."</p><p class="standard">"Tell
me."</p><p class="standard">"Mr.
and Mrs. Thompson. You saw them on the news the other night? They've
been avoiding the spotlight ever since that incident."</p><p class="standard">"I
can see why," I said.</p><p class="standard">"Last
night, a man came to their house claiming that he could bring their
son back to life, for a price."</p><p class="standard">That
was something you didn't hear from a door-to-door salesman every day.</p><p class="standard">"He
asked for ten thousand dollars."</p><p class="standard">"He
actually asked for money, not their eternal souls or an unspecified
future favor?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"Yes.
When I heard, I took Cathy—Mrs. Thompson—aside and had a
talk with her. She knew it was insane, but she told me a part of her
was thinking of going through with it. And I told her it might not be
so insane."</p><p class="standard">"That
was irresponsible of you," I commented.</p><p class="standard">"I
got the feeling that she and Brad were thinking of going through with
it no matter how insane I told them it was. And they said this man
knew details of Brian's life that no one outside the family and close
friends should know. And he brought a mouse back to life in front of
their eyes."</p><p class="standard">"Oh!
I see. Then he's absolutely for real. There's no way that could
possibly have been faked."</p><p class="standard">"I
told Cathy not to dismiss the man out of hand, but I also told her
not to be an idiot. First of all, dealing with him yourself is a bad
idea, I told her. You can't be objective about what you see. So get
someone else to deal with him. She asked who would do that for them.
I told her I knew someone who specializes in weird things, and that I
would ask him."</p><p class="standard">"And
that was me you were thinking of, I take it?"</p><p class="standard">"Yes."</p><p class="standard">I
never considered myself a specialist in weird things—at least,
not since I was nine, when I investigated a series of Mothman
sightings and discovered that some drunk teenagers were driving
around the countryside with a pair of red bicycle reflectors and a
sheet—but I guess when you meet someone because you came to ask
questions about her ten-year-old son's pregnancy, you get a
reputation as a specialist in weird things. 
</p><p class="standard">"What
else did you tell Brian's parents about me?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"That
you were the one who investigated Pastor Austen and discovered the
evidence that freed Mrs. Robson. That you're a local college student
whose family lives in this area. Your name."</p><p class="standard">"Any
chance they'd consent to sit down for an interview with me?"</p><p class="standard">"They
might, if they were convinced of your trustworthiness."</p><p class="standard">"All
right, I'll do it. Give me the details."</p><p class="standard">I was
to meet a man named Tyler Langston outside the hospital at ten that
night and go with him to resurrect Brian. The Thompsons would wire
Langston a thousand dollars at Western Union, accessible only if he
had the password, "America". If I thought he had fulfilled
the terms of the agreement, I would give him the password. Since
Langston's ID and the password were both necessary to withdraw the
money, neither of us could get it unless Langston fulfilled the
agreement or he and I colluded, and the Thompsons were trusting
June's word that I wouldn't collude enough to risk it.</p><p class="standard">"You
realize this plan is still insane, and totally irresponsible," I
said when she was finished explaining. "These people are risking
more money than I've ever had at one time on something that, if you
believe the Bible, hasn't happened in two thousand years."</p><p class="standard">"They're
desperate to see their child again," said June. "I can't
say I wouldn't do the same if I were in their position."</p><p class="standard">"My
mother wouldn't. I think her words regarding that situation would be,
'A serendipitous coincidence has delivered me from an asset which was
underperforming and showing signs of weakness in the long term, and I
am not about to buy it back.'" I glanced at my discarded
economics textbook.</p><p class="standard">"Well,
if you become a parent someday, perhaps you'll understand," said
June. 
</p><p class="standard">With
that, we ended the conversation, and I left my textbooks forgotten on
the table to prepare for that night.</p>

    </div><div class="chapter">
      <h2 class="heading"><a id="Chapter_7"></a></h2>
      <div class="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard"><b>07</b></p><p class="standard">In
contrast to the lively nightlife area, the medical district of Santa
Robles was completely dead by night.</p><p class="standard">There
were the usual ambulances coming and going, and the emergency room
was fairly bustling, but the rest of the place was just dead.</p><p class="standard">I
had been to this sprawling medical complex three times before: twice
to get drug tests for my jobs, and once as a child when Lucy had
broken her arm. The tower of the
main hospital was far and away the tallest building in Santa Robles,
soaring high above the rest of the small town like the headquarters
of the Tyrell Corporation. The complex was more of a city than a
hospital, although the entire facility had a single address.</p><p class="standard">I was supposed to meet this Langston fellow outside the
morgue. The morgue was its own building, standing apart like some
creepy stainless steel crypt, housing the bodies of those who had
died here. </p><p class="standard">I had pretended to go study in my room after dinner,
then sneaked out after I'd heard Sophia go to her own room. I don't
know why, but I felt as if I should hide this from her. Maybe I was
just being petulant, because she insisted on keeping secrets from me.</p><p class="standard">It was just a short bus ride from her house to the
medical complex, and I had plenty of time to walk around the and
admire the hydrangeas and tulips under the fluorescent street lamps;
I chose not to, and instead went straight for the morgue.</p><p class="standard">Standing outside the building, on the curb, was a
middle-aged man with dark hair and a long, saggy face like a Basset
hound. As I approached, he reached a huge, rugged hand into his black
coat and took out a cigarette, then noticed me and stopped.</p><p class="standard">"Well,
shoot, I thought I'd have time for a cigarette, but it looks like you
ah here already," he said in a Southern accent—not the
Oklahoma or Texas cowboy accent that was fairly common locally, but
more of a Georgia accent, with the <i>r</i>s
slid off the end. "I take it you ah James Moran?"</p><p class="standard">"I am. You must be Tyler Langston."</p><p class="standard">"That Ah am." He put the cigarette away and
reached out a hand, and I shook it with a rough squeeze. "You'll
pardon mah shock, but I was expecting someone just a tad older.
Still, they do say that youth is a drug that kills all ills—including
mistrust, I wager."</p><p class="standard">"Do they? How ghastly."</p><p class="standard">Langston
chuckled, and I was reminded of nights watching <i>The
X-Files </i>for
some reason.</p><p class="standard">Ah, that was it. The Cigarette Smoking Man. Here he
was, right in front of me.</p><p class="standard">"Well, as we're now both here, Ah suppose we might
get to business," said Langston. "There was a stated
amount—a very small fee, for the service being offered..."</p><p class="standard">"The money is at Western Union," I told him.
"I have the password, you have the identification."</p><p class="standard">"Of course, payment upon delivery. Though I assure
you, young man—" Langston swept his coat behind him as he
turned towards the entrance of the morgue, "—you shall have no
dissatisfaction at all with my services."</p><p class="standard">"I'll be the judge of that," I said.</p><p class="standard">The doors to the morgue were glass and opened
automatically as we approached. I followed Langston into an empty
lobby. The lights were low, and each footfall made a thunderous echo
as we crossed to the corridor.</p><p class="standard">"Where is everyone?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"Just on a little break," said Langston.
"Right now, they're having a real terrible feeling about coming
inside this place, just awful. They're feeling like if they come in
here, someone real important to them might die tomorrow. Maybe Pop
drops dead of a heart attack, or maybe Ma gets run down by a
semi...Maybe some madman runs through Junior's kindergarten with a
gun...They're feeling something like that, though if you asked them
they wouldn't know how to say it."</p><p class="standard">Langston led me down the corridor. Lining the corridor
were heavy metal doors like airlocks on a submarine, labeled with
numbers. I had no idea what the numbers meant or which room we were
looking for, but it seemed that Langston did, so I followed his lead.
</p><p class="standard">We descended a staircase and came into another
corridor, also lined with heavy metal doors, and passed along this
corridor for about twenty paces before Langston stopped. He opened
the nearest door, wrenching the titanium lever and pushing it open.</p><p class="standard">We came into a dimly lit room. Contrary to what I'd
been expecting, there weren't any of those pull-out freezer chambers
built into the walls that they always have on TV; instead, there was
a neat row of about ten gurneys, each covered by a white sheet. A
chill went through me, and much as I'd like to blame the cold, it was
the realization that those lumps under the sheets were dead bodies.
Laugh at me as you like.</p><p class="standard">Langston went straight to the nearest gurney and threw
back the sheet, revealing the cold, grey face of a teenage boy. He
was shorter than I'd expected, and nowhere near as bulky as Blake,
but had  obviously been in great shape. </p><p class="standard">He was dead, I thought. Where once he had played
football, bored my sister to tears, and engaged in homoerotic rivalry
with Blake, he was now dead.</p><p class="standard">For now.</p><p class="standard">Langston took something out of his coat. "Here,
look at this," he said, handing it to me. It looked like some
kind of homemade egg timer, a D-cell battery attached to two wires
which ran to a plastic dial. Two alligator clips hung out from the
bottom. Langston took the device back and hooked the alligator clips
to Brian's nipples.</p><p class="standard">That was going to hurt if he woke up and found those
clamped on his nipples.</p><p class="standard">Langston said, "Here's where the magic happens,"
and turned the dial all the way up.</p><p class="standard">The dial ran down, making a whirring sound as it went.</p><p class="standard">We waited for exactly sixty seconds. </p><p class="standard">And Brian's eyes opened.</p><p class="standard">Brian shot up, heaving breaths in and out, his skin
still pale and grey, but life now in him.</p><p class="standard">He blinked.</p><p class="standard">He looked around, first at Langston, then at me, and
then around the room, as if he remembered where he was but didn't
trust his memory.</p><p class="standard">And then he asked, "Wasn't I dead?"</p><p class="standard">"You were," said Langston, "but not
anymore. Your ma and pa paid me good money to see to that." He
went over to the cabinets around the edge of the room and got out
Brian's clothes and personal effects. "Here you are. Some thief
took all the cash in your wallet, to judge by the difference between
what's in here and what's written on the inventory, but other than
that it seems all your things are here."</p><p class="standard">"Who was it?" Brian asked. He glanced at me,
but I couldn't do any more than look back with a dumbfounded,
sheep-like gaze. "Who killed me?"</p><p class="standard">Langston smiled. "Sure you want to know? By the
way, James, I'd like that password now, if you don't mind."</p><p class="standard">I reached out and touched Brian on the shoulder, just
to make sure he wasn't a rubber doll. He wasn't. And he stared at me
with disgust.</p><p class="standard">"Uh, sure," I said. "The password's
'America'." </p><p class="standard">"How patriotic. So, Brian, you'd like to know who
it was killed you."</p><p class="standard">"Yeah," said Brian. "Yeah, I wanna
know."</p><p class="standard">I had no idea if Langston knew or not. I didn't see how
he could, unless it had been him. But I recalled June telling me how
Langston had known things no one outside the family would know. I
recalled Kenneth—the more I thought about it, the more I
thought those misgivings I'd had towards him were just the stirrings
of long-forgotten brotherly protectiveness towards Sue. </p><p class="standard">But Lucy had warned me not to forget Amber.</p><p class="standard">And I hadn't.</p><p class="standard">Still, something inside me didn't want to let Kenneth
take the blame for this.</p><p class="standard">Something inside me wanted to make sure the most
blame-worthy people took the blame.</p><p class="standard">So I said,</p><p class="standard">"It was Blake Darnell."</p><p class="standard">I blurted it.</p><p class="standard">Before I could stop myself.</p><p class="standard">And before I could stop myself, I added,</p><p class="standard">"Not just him. Everyone else on the football team.
They were all jealous of you, the black guys and the white guys
both."</p><p class="standard">I felt the breath leave my chest.</p><p class="standard">Brian looked from me to Langston, who nodded and
grinned his backwoods grin. "Sure was. Those boys is all jealous
of you, Brian." He placed his hand on Brian's back. "What
do you say we go pay them all a visit?" </p><p class="standard">"Yeah," said Brian, getting up off the table
and taking his jeans and jacket from Langston. "I'll show them.
I'll show them what happens when they mess with me."</p><p class="standard">When Brian had finished dressing, Langston grinned at
me again. "You can find your own way out, can't you, James?"
he said as he guided Brian through the door, his hand on Brian's back
like a protective father. </p><p class="standard">I didn't want to be in that cold room with those dead
bodies under the sheets another instant, so I followed close on
Langston's and Brian's heels as they ascended the stairs, my heart
pounding. I tried to stop myself from heaving my breaths and mostly
failed. Both of them ignored me anyway, but I heard Langston reciting
what sounded like names and addresses to Brian—probably the
names and addresses of all the football team members that Brian now
believed had killed him and was planning to kill in retaliation. </p><p class="standard">Just in case, I reached into my pocket and turned on my
digital recorder.</p><p class="standard">I left the building close behind Langston and Brian,
with Langston still reciting addresses, and followed them down the
street until Langston had stopped reciting. Langston occasionally
glanced back at me with a condescending little smirk—or was
that just a trick of the light? </p><p class="standard">It seemed obvious that Langston wanted Brian to think
the football team members had killed him.</p><p class="standard">The question was why.</p><p class="standard">I stood under a streetlight debating what to do and
watched Langston and Brian walk off into the distance, disappearing
into the darkness.</p><p class="standard">I didn't know what Langston was. He seemed human, but
unless this was all some big prank, he had used some kind of
supernatural powers. </p><p class="standard">He might be just what he seemed.</p><p class="standard">But he might one of those dangerous creatures like
Joseph Austen, or Sophia herself, for that matter, who could kill you
in ways that would vaporize your body so no one would ever know what
had happened to you.</p><p class="standard">I decided to go back. Sophia might be willing to tell
me something. If not, I could at least check the Internet and see if
Langston had left any record of himself online. See if anything I
found suggested that he wasn't human.</p><p class="standard">I got on a bus, my heart still pounding, and rode back
to Sophia's house.</p><p class="standard">My heart didn't stop pounding the whole time.</p><p class="standard">Langston would have told Brian that the football team
had killed him no matter what I said, so what I'd said probably
didn't matter.</p><p class="standard">But I had still said it. I had still appraised
Kenneth's life at several times the value of the football team
members' lives. I had still decreed death for them, so that he could
live. </p><p class="standard">I had no right to do that. </p><p class="standard">A spastic failure, good for nothing but stacking TVs at
Best Buy, had no right to decide who lived and who died.</p><p class="standard">My heart was going to stop pretty soon if it didn't
stop pounding.</p><p class="standard">I let myself in and found Sophia sitting at the table
in her pajamas.</p><p class="standard">"You wear pajamas with little flowers on them?"
I said, looking her over.</p><p class="standard">"They're gardenias. I think they're nice,"
said Sophia, pushing her glasses up her nose as she turned to face
me. She'd been studying and drinking a mug of something. "Are
you going to tell me where you were?"</p><p class="standard">"I was looking for people for you to kill so you
could reclaim your succubus mivonks despite thinking that gardenia
pajamas are nice," I said.</p><p class="standard">I sat down at the table and grabbed her mug, sniffing
at it. "Is that chicory coffee?"</p><p class="standard">"I think it's nice." </p><p class="standard">"Make me some."</p><p class="standard">"Make it yourself."</p><p class="standard">"If you make it for me, I'll tell you where I
was."<br />"I have a feeling you're going to tell me anyway,
so no."</p><p class="standard">Remarkably, the beating of my heart had slowed down
almost as soon as I came in and saw Sophia sitting at the table, so
in token of that, I made it myself, and told her what had happened as
I did it. </p><p class="standard">Her face became more and more grave as I spoke, and by
the end she was looking morose again, as she had earlier after her
conversation with Lucy. </p><p class="standard">"I'm sorry. I...I can't help you. Even if this
Langston person is supernatural, what he's doing isn't high-profile
enough to allow me to get involved."</p><p class="standard">"So killing eleven people—or however many
there are on this football team—is just small peanuts for you,"
I said, starting to get angry. I hadn't actually expected her to go
slice up Langston and pheromone Brian into forgetting his
revenge—hoped, yeah, but not expected—but her refusal to
tell me even the simplest things, like how Langston could have
apparently brought someone back from the dead, was maddening. "It's
too small for you to even bother with."</p><p class="standard">"That's not what I mean. I'd like to help, but—"</p><p class="standard">"Would you really? 'Cause it seems when you'd like
to help, you do it. You get yourself out of bed early to go help old
people clean, but when it comes to the lives of a whole high school
football team, all you can do is brainlessly quote regulations! You
mean you can't even tell me 'Hey, heads up, weird shit coming up
ahead'? Forget this, talking to you is pointless. I'll go find out
whatever I can and try to stop this myself." I left the room,
ignoring the look of pure misery on Sophia's face, and went upstairs.</p><p class="standard">No, I didn't ignore.</p><p class="standard">For just one second, I actually reveled in it.</p><p class="standard">After all, if it really made her feel so bad, all she
had to do was help me.</p><p class="standard">Up in the guest room, I took out my computer and did a
search on Tyler Langston.</p><p class="standard">I didn't know how common it was for supernatural
creatures to enroll in school, but it looked to me like Langston was
human. </p><p class="standard">His resume was on Monster.com.</p><p class="standard">He'd graduated from high school in a small town in
Tennessee and had a bachelor's degree in economics from Harvard, and
an MBA from Yale. </p><p class="standard">I found some newspaper clippings from a few years ago
that chronicled his later doings. Apparently putting his resume on
Monster.com hadn't done him much good, because he had turned to crime
to pay the bills. About eight years ago he'd been in court on charges
of running a meth ring. He'd allegedly enlisted scores of the
hillbillies, hicks, and rednecks who populated this area to cook meth
in their trailers and sheds, then hooked them up with buyers from the
scores of gang bangers and militias who also populated this area. The
city guys would buy from the country guys, and Langston would take a
cut of the profit as payment for getting the cookers the supplies
they needed and connecting them to buyers. The country guys, most of
whom had been cooking meth for years, liked this setup, because when
they had to sell it themselves, it was pretty common for some of
their erstwhile buddies to show up one night in ski masks, waving
guns around, and take the product for themselves. This way it was
gone as soon as it had been cooked, leaving money in its place. The
city guys, for their part, also liked this setup, because it avoided
the necessity of running cooks in the city, where they were liable to
get busted by the cops, or paying extra money to get somewhere in the
country to cook.</p><p class="standard">At least, that was the story. Langston himself had
beaten the rap, though several of his clients hadn't.</p><p class="standard">By the way, it's obvious that something is
fundamentally wrong with this country when someone with an MBA from
Yale finds meth running more profitable than working.</p><p class="standard">My guess is they laughed him out of the boardroom with
Colonel Sanders impressions when they heard his accent.</p><p class="standard">Or he just sort of coasted through Yale, partying all
the while.</p><p class="standard">There was a knock at the door. "It's your damn
house, come in if you want," I snapped.</p><p class="standard">The door opened slowly, and Sophia appeared, like a
kangaroo rat cautiously edging its way out of a hole. "I want to
apologize again," she said.</p><p class="standard">"I'm still mad," I answered, though I wasn't
really.</p><p class="standard">Sophia came in and sat down on the bed. She leaned back
and crossed her legs, and I noticed that the neck of her gardenia
pajamas wasn't buttoned all the way up, and she wasn't wearing a bra.</p><p class="standard">All I could do was imagine that she had teeth down
there. </p><p class="standard">What she actually had was much more terrible, but for
now the teeth image was working for me.</p><p class="standard">"There are some things I can tell you," she
said, "and I was going to, but I opened with the wrong thing. I
apologize."</p><p class="standard">"Well, fine. Let's say I forgive you. I've got no
right to be mad at you anyway, under the circumstances."</p><p class="standard">"Have you found out anything about Langston?"
she asked.</p><p class="standard">I told her what I found and how it suggested Langston
was human. Sophia agreed. "Some of us have fake histories, but
not usually that extensive. We tend to jump between identities a
lot," she said. "If I had gone as far as going to court for
drug running, I don't think I'd still be using the same identity. But
it does seem like he has supernatural powers. I don't know if I've
mentioned this, but there are what you'd call necromancers in this
world as well."</p><p class="standard">"<i>I </i>wouldn't call them that," I
corrected her. "I'd call them 'freaks'. But go on."</p><p class="standard">"The usual image of a necromancer is someone who
brings the dead back to life or communicates with spirits from the
other side, but there's no way I know of to bring back someone who's
really and truly dead. So the only way Langston could have brought
Brian back to life is—"</p><p class="standard">"—if he was never really dead in the first
place," I finished.</p><p class="standard">"Right. There are toxins that can throw someone
into a coma. Then a necromancer can reawaken him as some other sort
of creature, similar to the way I was turned from a human into a
succubus."</p><p class="standard">"That's it. This is all about money," I said.
"Langston needed some new way to make money. But the drug trade
was too risky, especially when he'd barely escaped conviction once
before. He learned necromancy at some point, recently or in the past,
I don't know, and he murdered Brian—or at least, he pretended
to, and snake venom was probably the perfect way to cover up whatever
he'd used to fake Brian's death, so he pretended to murder Brian with
a snake. Then he went to Brian's parents and offered to resurrect
their son, knowing they'd pay whatever they had to see him again. But
he wanted to get this over and done with as quickly as possible, so
he just asked for ten thousand—a lot of money, but not
impossible to get on short notice."</p><p class="standard">"But—I know I said before that this case
wasn't high-profile enough for me to get involved, but it does seem
that faking Brian's murder by King Cobra attracted lots of
attention," said Sophia. "Why did he take that risk?"</p><p class="standard">"To convince Brian that the other members of the
football team murdered him, his death had to be big and violent,"
I said. "It had to be obviously murder—if he'd used a
spider or a poison mushroom, it might be possible to pass it off as
an accident. This way Brian wakes up knowing he was murdered, ready
to take revenge. Plus, maybe Langston is planning to start an
industry with this sort of thing. Now he can sneak around knocking
off people's kids and then come and tell them, 'I brought Brian
Thompson back to life, you know.' It's like advertising."</p><p class="standard">"Then Langston might be planning to have Brian
'kill' the other members of the football team, then offer their
parents the same deal," said Sophia. </p><p class="standard">I flipped my computer shut and glanced at the time. It
was almost midnight. I took my recorder from my pocket and started
playing the roll of names and houses that Langston had read off
earlier.</p><p class="standard">"What's that?" Sophia asked.</p><p class="standard">"Langston told these to Brian as they were leaving
the morgue together," I said. Fortunately, the sound quality was
good. I hadn't gotten the name on the first one, but I'd gotten the
address—2334 Bueller Lane.</p><p class="standard">"Where is that?" I asked Sophia.</p><p class="standard">"Out in the suburbs. I'll drive you."</p><p class="standard">"No, stay here. It's better if you can't be even
remotely suspected of interfering when it wasn't warranted, right?
I'm going to try and resolve this on my own."</p>

      <h2 class="heading"><a id="Chapter_8"></a></h2>
      <div class="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard">When
I turned the corner away from the streetlights of Pharisee Street
onto Bueller Lane, I froze in my steps.</p><p class="standard">The
second my foot crossed the line in the pavement between the two
roads, my heart fell into my stomach and a chill gripped my chest. I
tried to move my legs, couldn't. I tried again, couldn't.</p><p class="standard">This
must be the "real bad feeling" that Langston had described.</p><p class="standard">I
took three deep breaths and tried to gain control of myself. I was
here by myself in the dead of night going after a necromancer and his
resurrected victim. That was enough to creep anyone out. And I didn't
really know how they'd react to my attempts to stop them, but I did
know that I had no backup at all, no police and no guardian succubus
watching over me. That was enough to make anyone hesitate. </p><p class="standard">But
the important thing was to keep going.</p><p class="standard">And
I did.</p><p class="standard">And
there they were.</p><p class="standard">When
I saw Brian's back, the Jerry Rice football team logo on the back of
his jacket, above an Ace Hardware logo for the team's sponsor, I
froze again.</p><p class="standard">By
the way, when I had deigned to attend my classes at Jerry Rice, the
textbooks had also been endorsed by Ace Hardware. The math books had
had problems like "Pablo needs to build a fence. He goes to Ace©Hardware and buys the materials. Fencing is five dollars per foot,
and Pablo pays $600 for what he buys after receiving a discount with
his Ace©rewards card. How many feet of fencing did Pablo buy?"</p><p class="standard">And
with that ridiculous memory, I trotted up behind Brian and Langston,
who was scuffling  along beside Brian like some overgrown black rat.</p><p class="standard">They
seemed to be taking it easy, given that they were going to kill
eleven people. They were walking along in silence, Langston with his
hands in his pockets, Brian with his arms swaying by his sides.</p><p class="standard">I
came up alongside Brian, who didn't react at all to my sudden
appearance. "Hey, Brian! Buddy! How's it going? How's life
treating you?"</p><p class="standard">Brian
ignored me.</p><p class="standard">"So,
James, what brings you here?" said Langston, greeting me with a
huge, shit-eating grin, like some kind of shit-eater. I wanted to
wipe that shit-eating grin off his face by making him eat shit.</p><p class="standard">"I
just need to tell Brian the truth about how he died," I said,
returning what I hoped was an equally shit-eating grin, despite the
fact that I never touched the stuff. "Brian, the football team
didn't kill you. Your death was just a tragic accident."</p><p class="standard">Brian
completely ignored me.</p><p class="standard">"Now
that you're alive again, you don't want to spend your life in
prison," I tried. "Just go home and show your parents that
you're okay, and forget all about this. It wasn't the football team
guys, and you don't want to go to prison over them."</p><p class="standard">He
continued to completely ignore me. 	</p><p class="standard">"I
mean, did you really think they were so jealous that they'd kill you
for it? Get over yourself, man," I continued. "Who does
that? No one would kill someone just because he's better at football
than they are. They'd be crippling themselves for the big game, the
one against whoever that's coming up. The one your coach was so
desperate to win that he covered up the fight between you and Blake
and told you guys to get along. You don't want to disappoint Coach,
do you? Come on, do it for Coach."</p><p class="standard">I
had no idea if that would work or not, but it was the sort of drivel
they always said in sports movies when the hero was thinking of doing
something stupid that would ruin the game, like crawling back inside
a bottle. The hero would always come to his senses and abstain from
doing the stupid thing so Coach wouldn't be disappointed in him.
Since Brian was so obsessed with football, I thought maybe that sort
of thing would work on him. I was disappointed when it didn't, even
more disappointed than Coach was going to be when Brian was the only
one who showed up to play in the big game, and only stuck around long
enough for Coach to see that playing in an ankle bracelet is really
difficult.</p><p class="standard">"Brian,
don't listen to this boy, he doesn't know what he's talking about,"
said Langston. "It was indeed the other members of the football
team who killed you. It was because they were jealous of you.  And
you are not going to ever be put on trial if you do to them what they
tried to do to you. This is never going to hold up in a court of law,
and young James here knows it."</p><p class="standard">"If
you don't believe what I'm saying, then try thinking about the
evidence," I countered. "There was a snake in your car. How
would the guys on the football team get a snake? It wasn't just some
rattlesnake they could have found in the bushes out here. That was a
King Cobra. The kind that only lives in India. Where would Blake
Darnell get a snake that only lives in India?"</p><p class="standard">"Now
that's just foolish. Brian, there was no snake. The other boys beat
you. They held you down and hit you, over and over again, until you
didn't get up again. It took fifteen of them to take you, Brian, and
when they were done and realized they'd killed you, well they ran off
like the cowards they are and told filthy lies to the police,"
said Langston. </p><p class="standard">"Filthy
liars," said Brian.</p><p class="standard">"That's
right, they certainly are. Not young James here, though; he's merely
misinformed. Please forgive him for what he's doing, Brian."</p><p class="standard">"Just
misinformed," Brian echoed.</p><p class="standard">"Brian,
Langston here, your buddy, he took ten thousand dollars from your
parents in return for bringing you back," I said. "How do
you know <i>he</i>didn't kill you?"</p><p class="standard">Brian
looked at Langston as if he hadn't noticed Langston was there until
now. "He didn't," Brian said. "Blake and those other
okra-sucking niggers did it. And those nigger-loving fags. All of
them were jealous of me. They all wanted what I had."<br />"There
you have it," said Langston. "Brian will not hear a word
against me, James. Why would you try to convince him I did such a
thing?"<br />"I know your game, Langston," I said.
"I've got your number. I'm on your case. Any other cop cliches
you can think of."</p><p class="standard">"Whatever
do you mean by that, young James?"</p><p class="standard">"This
is all about money for you. Now that your drug business crumbled, you
figured you'd get involved in the resurrection business and start
killing off people's kids and bringing them back to life. I know
that's your game, but I'm still a little confused about why you
picked Brian. Why not find Chelsea Clinton and squeeze Hillary for
the royalties on her next book?"</p><p class="standard">Langston
just smiled at me as we came up to a white two-floor house, a tract
house like all the others on this street, except for the address
numbers.</p><p class="standard">2334.</p><p class="standard">Brian
broke off from our little trio and began walking across the lawn
towards the side window.</p><p class="standard">"A
friendly word of advice, James: you may wish to join me over here,"
said Langston, moving towards the other side of the street.</p><p class="standard">I
joined him.</p><p class="standard">Brian
looked up the wall at the second-floor window. Then he jumped.</p><p class="standard">If
he could jump like that back when he was on the football team, I
guess maybe he really was worth being jealous of.</p><p class="standard">His
leap catapulted him all the way up to the second floor, a jump of
about twenty-five feet straight into the air, and sent him crashing
through the glass.</p><p class="standard">About
thirty seconds later—though it felt like much, much
longer—Brian came leaping back out of the house and resumed his
walk down the street.</p><p class="standard">"Well,
James, you're welcome to follow Brian around as much as you like, but
as for this old man, I'm tired and I'm goin home to sleep," said
Langston. He set off down the street in the direction we'd come from.</p><p class="standard">I
could chase Brian, or I could chase Langston.</p><p class="standard">Brian.
If I could, I wanted to stop him from killing anyone else. It didn't
seem like I could, but I could at least keep trying.</p><p class="standard">But
I needed some help.</p><p class="standard">Sophia
answered the phone before the first ring had even cut off. "What's
going on?" she asked.</p><p class="standard">I
followed Brian at a remove of about ten paces, like a Saudi Arabian
bride, and told Sophia everything that had happened so far.</p><p class="standard">"From
what you say, I think I know what he is," said Sophia. "I
think Brian is a taxim. It's an Eastern European undead creature. Its
business is revenge, and the first question it asks is 'Who killed
me?' Whatever answer it gets will become fixed in its mind, and it
will walk to wherever that person is and kill them."</p><p class="standard">"It
can't take a taxi?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"No,
despite its name, the taxim will never ride in a taxi, or any other
kind of vehicle. It always walks. That means you can avoid them by
moving far away whenever it gets close to you. Eventually it'll get
to you—I've even heard of them walking across the bottom of the
ocean to get to islands—but it can't move any faster than a
walk. Also, it only walks at night; during the day it will go to
sleep in a graveyard to rest. And it will never hurt anyone who isn't
part of its revenge, unless it's attacked first."</p><p class="standard">"So
it's impossible to change its mind about who killed it?" I
asked.</p><p class="standard">"Yes."</p><p class="standard">That
was unfortunate. It would've been so convenient if we could have just
told Brian that Rand Paul had killed him so he would spend a year
walking to Kentucky to the Paul household.</p><p class="standard">"Is
there any way to stop it?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"When
it first wakes up you can tell it that its death was a result of
nature, or God's will. Then it will walk the earth trying to kill God
for the rest of eternity, and will be no threat to anyone. Otherwise,
the only way is to convince it that justice and retribution are best
left in the hands of God. If it's convinced, it will go to sleep
forever."</p><p class="standard">"All
right, I'm going to give it a try," I said. "Stay on the
line, just in case I need you again."</p><p class="standard">"Aye-aye
sir."</p><p class="standard">I
caught up with Brian and began walking alongside him again. "Listen,
Brian," I said. "You know this is wrong, right? This whole
vengeance thing, it's a mug's game. We're all just miserable old
human beans, you know? We sons of Adam couldn't even find our own
asses if God hadn't given us eyes to see 'em with and asses to find.
Leave it up to Him, why don't you. If these guys really did kill you
out of jealousy, they'll get theirs on the day of judgment. Envy is
one of the Seven Deadly Sins, you know. Don't stain your own soul
killing these guys."</p><p class="standard">I
did my best impression of one of the counselors at the Catholic high
school giving advice about the daily problems of youth, but Brian
didn't even glance at me.</p><p class="standard">"Really,
you and I, we're just a couple of sinners, right? I mean, you're
filled with pride and lust. Me, I'm so full of lust I even look at my
own sister with eyes of lust. The only way I make it through the day
is by remembering that Jesus Christ died for my sins, and to repay
him I have to remember that I'm a sinner, and thus unworthy to cast
the first stone. You know?"</p><p class="standard">"Stop
that," said Brian. "I'm an atheist. All that God crap, it's
not gonna convince me."</p><p class="standard">I
just stared at him.</p><p class="standard">There
was no way his parents were okay with this. They were the usual God,
Country, and Barbecues type that one saw in Donner's Rest. Contrary
to what Obama said, it was really the barbecues they clung to, but
religion was at least a distant third, after barbecues and guns.</p><p class="standard">Thus,
I had been absolutely sure I could convince him to leave retribution
in the hands of the Lord.</p><p class="standard">So
now I had to try to convince him to leave retribution in the hands of
whoever atheists entrusted retribution to.</p><p class="standard">"Well,
fine. But even without God, there are still other authorities to
handle the business of retribution and justice and all that," I
said.</p><p class="standard">"Like
who?" Brian asked.</p><p class="standard">"Um...the
courts, for example."</p><p class="standard">Did
that sound as hollow to you as it did to me?</p><p class="standard">The
police would never figure out how Brian had been killed by a King
Cobra in the parking lot of a high school in a small northern
California town, especially the geniuses they hire for police in
small northern California towns. I had once reported on a woman who'd
been attacked by someone with a chain. She'd fought back, kicking him
in the nose and knocking out a few of his teeth, and had managed to
escape. His blood was all over her shoe and the hem of her pants, and
his incisors were scattered across the sidewalk.</p><p class="standard">On
<i>CSI</i>, they would have
done DNA tests on those items and had a suspect within a few days.</p><p class="standard">In this small
northern California town, the deputy who arrived had helpfully tossed
the teeth in a nearby dumpster, then helpfully advised the victim to
wash those bloodstains out with Tide detergent. He wasn't being paid
by Tide to recommend it, he assured her. It was just that he'd seen
enough bloodstains over the years to know what got them out.</p><p class="standard">So chances were, if
this matter were left to the courts, they would rule his death to be
a freak accident, and his parents would learn a down-home recipe to
remove bloodstains from clothes.</p><p class="standard">Clearly, I needed
another idea.</p><p class="standard">I called Sophia
back. "It's not working," I said. "He's an atheist,
and neither one of us believes in the justice system. I need another
idea."</p><p class="standard">"I'm sorry,
that's what all the legends say. I've never dealt with one
personally."</p><p class="standard">"All right,
all right. But you're absolutely sure that he won't try to take a cab
or anything to get where he's going faster?"</p><p class="standard">"That's what
all the legends say."</p><p class="standard">I wasn't about to
believe in the legends without seeing it for myself, after how badly
they'd failed us the first time, so I caught up to Brian again and
fell into step beside him. "Say, I bet you could find a cab
somewhere that would take you to the guys' houses faster than
walking. Even at this hour there are a few around."</p><p class="standard">"Cab?"</p><p class="standard">"You know, a
taxi. A taxi for a taxim."</p><p class="standard">"Who are you,
again?"</p><p class="standard">I fell back and
brought the phone to my ear again. "All right, the legends
weren't complete crap.  So, look, it's one in the morning. The sun
should be up in around five hours. Go online for me and find out
where the rest of the football team members live. At least the five
starting members. Okay?"</p><p class="standard">"Consider it
done." </p><p class="standard">A few minutes
later, Sophia's voice reappeared on the phone. "Okay, judging by
the street you're on, the one he killed already was probably Devon
Sharps. You're about ten miles from Travis Coates, the next one."</p><p class="standard">"Okay. The
average human walks about three miles an hour, he's been setting a
leisurely pace, so we probably have at least three hours before he
would reach the next house. He's got to return to his grave site to
rest—I assume that means the hospital—"</p><p class="standard">"Not
necessarily," said Sophia. "Anywhere the dead have been
buried, he can relocate his grave site. If you pass a cemetery, he
can make that his new grave and stop there."</p><p class="standard">"What happens
if he doesn't reach a grave by the time the sun rises?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"He'll shrivel
into dust. So he'll be conservative about finding somewhere to bed
down."</p><p class="standard">"Okay. I'm
going to follow him until he stops so we know where he is. Stay by
the phone in case I need you."</p>

      <h2 class="heading"><a id="Chapter_9"></a></h2>
      <div class="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard">I followed Brian until six in the morning.</p><p class="standard">At six, he hopped over someone's fence and went into their
backyard. I watched him go under the house and bed down.</p><p class="standard">"Why here?" I asked, wondering if he would answer. He
didn't. I figure some stray dog probably died under this house.</p><p class="standard">I took note of the address. It was only about half a mile from
Travis Coates's house, so Brian would definitely get there tomorrow
night if I didn't figure out some way to stop him. 
</p><p class="standard">Then I called Sophia and asked her to pick me up.</p><p class="standard">She came, in her navy blue Audi, looking as unkempt as always.</p><p class="standard">"I'm exhausted," I said as I got in. "I haven't
spent all night running around in ages."</p><p class="standard">"Well, don't give up yet," said Sophia. "We're
going to the library to study for exams."</p><p class="standard">Yes, she made me come to the library to study after being up all
night chasing the undead.</p><p class="standard">I spent three hours staring at the same math problem, letting it
just swirl into a meaningless procession of symbols, before I just
laid my head down on the desk and closed my eyes. Sophia tried to
slap me up, then tried to seduce me up, then gave up.</p><p class="standard">It felt kind of nice, having an attractive girl whisper in my
ear.</p><p class="standard">Saying what she would do for me if I got up.</p><p class="standard">Of course, it was all a lie. She wouldn't do anything for me,
because for whatever reason, she wanted me to be alive. She wanted me
not to crumble into dust. My non-crumbling into dust was not assured
if I did anything with her; in fact, my crumbling into dust was
assured.</p><p class="standard">So I ignored her come-ons, and kept sleeping, until she shook my
shoulder and said it was lunchtime.</p><p class="standard">We went to a Thai place for lunch. I ordered green curry and a
big cup of the most highly caffeinated beverage they had (which was
some sort of black tea), then slept on the table until it arrived. 
</p><p class="standard">"I can't figure it out," I mumbled between bites of
green curry.</p><p class="standard">"What?"</p><p class="standard">"How did Langston know about this 'opportunity'?"</p><p class="standard">Sophia swirled some noodles around her chopsticks and ate them
rather messily, getting sauce all over her chin, then quickly wiped
it off. She's not dainty or refined, that girl. You'd think a
Frenchwoman would do better.</p><p class="standard">"The fight couldn't have been that secret," said
Sophia. "The janitor you spoke to knew about it. Other people
probably did."</p><p class="standard">"People at the school," I said. "But as far as we
know, Langston has no association with that school. And yeah, if he
manages to get paid for all eleven starting members of the football
team, he gets a hundred and ten thousand, so that's not bad. But how
does he know he'll get paid for all of them? What if some of the
parents don't buy it? Even Brian's parents almost didn't buy it. This
plan just seems like such a convoluted, risky way to make money."</p><p class="standard">"So you think that someone tipped off Langston and is
offering him extra money to do this," said Sophia.</p><p class="standard">"Yeah, but I can't figure out who. If it was one of the
football players, he wouldn't kill off the whole team. And who else
would care enough?"</p><p class="standard">"A rival football coach?" Sophia suggested.</p><p class="standard">"Maybe. But it feels wrong somehow."</p><p class="standard">"A random maniac?"</p><p class="standard">"I don't even have to explain why that idea is stupid. Could
it be one of your people?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">Sophia shook her head. "No supernatural creature I know of
would hire a human like Langston to do something like this. They
would use their own powers or find another supernatural creature to
work with."</p><p class="standard">"Are we sure he's human? He did turn Brian into a taxim."</p><p class="standard">"No supernatural creature would go to Yale Business School."</p><p class="standard">I felt that Sophia was here using a form of the 'No True
Scotsman' fallacy, but since I had squeaked through the argumentative
writing class I'd taken last semester with a C-, which I had obtained
only after begging the instructor on bended knee to give an extra
credit assignment and then getting a C+ on it, I didn't want to start
dueling fallacy accusations with her.</p><p class="standard">After lunch, we went by the Alpha Beta Gamma sorority house on
campus to find out the date of their next party. I had been dreading
this ever since I promised Sue I would find out when the party was,
because it would entail talking to sorority girls. Sorority girls
make me nervous, for two reasons. The first reason is that they're
pretty, and pretty girls sometimes make men do stupid things,
especially men like me with no experience with women. With most
pretty girls, it's not malicious, but with sorority girls it's always
malicious. They're hateful malicious beings who like to treat men as
their playthings.</p><p class="standard">The second reason sorority girls made me nervous is that I always
somehow felt like I was committing a stereotyping fallacy whenever I
listed the reasons why they made me nervous.</p><p class="standard">Anyway, I was sitting in the front seat of Sophia's car, working
myself up to go in and find the fattest, ugliest sorority girl I
could, who I expected would still be at least as pretty as Claudia
Black, when Sophia said, "Shall I come in with you?"</p><p class="standard">"Shut up, ugly! I don't need your help!" I snapped.</p><p class="standard">"Okay. You seem a little nervous, though, and I thought
maybe the idea of talking to sorority girls was intimidating you."</p><p class="standard">How does she know me this well after just a few weeks?</p><p class="standard">"I thought if you had someone with you, it might seem less
intimidating."</p><p class="standard">"You thought wrong. I don't need your help to talk to girls.
I've talked to tons of pretty girls. If I got out my yearbook from
the last year of high school, on every page there would be a pretty
girl that I talked to. And that I did."</p><p class="standard">"Okay."</p><p class="standard">"That was a lie. Please come inside with me."</p><p class="standard">"Okay."</p><p class="standard">Sophia and I went into the lobby of the sorority house, a
crumbling old ruin at the edge of the campus. The freeway on-ramp was
just across the street, and the noise of cars speeding by was close
to deafening. Even a lousy college like this should have been able to
find somewhere better to house our nation's future trophy wives and
Victoria's Secret models.</p><p class="standard">We went up the concrete steps through the revolving glass doors
into the lobby of the sorority house. The dismal brown carpet, gnawed
at the edges by rodents, felt mushy under my feet. The lower walls
had been repainted in white, but the roof and higher walls were still
covered with chipped yellow paint. I expected all of these girls to
get cancer from the asbestos hidden inside the walls by the time they
were fifty.</p><p class="standard">"You don't get much for your money here," Sophia
commented. It was so unlike her to speak badly of anything; that in
itself was proof enough that the place was a dump.</p><p class="standard">Since it was Sunday, I had expected most of the girls to be in,
and hadn't thought finding someone to ask would be a problem. It
seemed that exactly the opposite was true; almost no one was here.
Sophia and I milled around in the lobby for a while, waiting for
someone to appear.</p><p class="standard">"Shall I go look for someone?" Sophia asked me.</p><p class="standard">At that moment, a girl appeared at the top of the stairs, and I
felt the breath catch in my chest. It wasn't her beauty that left me
speechless, though she was beautiful—pale skin, flush with
life, and deep black hair, cut in a simple bob. Clear blue eyes. A
shapely body, like Botticelli's Venus on the half shell. Dressed
simply in blue jeans and a black blouse.</p><p class="standard">It wasn't her beauty that left me speechless; it was that I felt
I knew her. She reminded me of someone I used to know. And why that
would make my breath catch, I can't say.</p><p class="standard">As she came to the bottom of the stairs, a book clutched in her
arm, she noticed me staring at her and recoiled. Then she saw Sophia,
and relaxed somewhat. "Can I help you?" she asked.</p><p class="standard">I meant to ask her when the next party was, then turn around and
run. Instead,</p><p class="standard">"Elizabeth?"</p><p class="standard">is what I said, and she stared at me for a second, then laughed.</p><p class="standard">"James Moran! No, it's not Beth. Don't you remember me?"</p><p class="standard">I honestly didn't.</p><p class="standard">"I'm Mary. Her sister."</p><p class="standard">Oh, right. You were just a brat back then. Who knew you'd grew up
to be such a beauty?</p><p class="standard">Mary Gault came up to me, now friendly and relaxed, and pushed
her hair off her forehead, smiling and showing off her pretty white
teeth. "It took me a while, but you were the only one who ever
called her 'Elizabeth'. The rest of us called her 'Beth'."</p><p class="standard">"I used to call her 'Elz' sometimes too," I said.</p><p class="standard">"That's right, that's right. How have you been?"</p><p class="standard">Such a loaded question. Such a can of worms. Such a kettle of
fish. Such a hall of mirrors. I settled for the socially acceptable
answer of 
</p><p class="standard">"Fine. What about you?"</p><p class="standard">Mary nodded. "Fine. I'm in a sorority, after all." As
if that were a litmus test for fineness. Finery equals sorority.</p><p class="standard">"You and Elz both, I always thought you were going to end up
at Stanford or something."</p><p class="standard">Mary shrugged. "Maybe not as fine as I used to be," she
said. "Is this your friend?"</p><p class="standard">"I'm Sophia de Nuit," said Sophia, stepping forward to
touch Mary's hand and introduce herself. "Pleased to meet you."</p><p class="standard">"Is this your...girlfriend?" Mary asked.</p><p class="standard">"Definitely not," I said.</p><p class="standard">"How mean," Sophia pouted.</p><p class="standard">Mary gave me a complex look, shifted her gaze to Sophia, and then
back to me. "So, what brings you to this end of campus?
Obviously you didn't come to see me."</p><p class="standard">"Actually, my sister wants to come to your next party, and I
promised her I would find out when it was."</p><p class="standard">"Lu?"</p><p class="standard">"My other sister, Sue."</p><p class="standard">"Oh, Susie! Sure, sure. We've got it planned for Friday
night. If you give me your number, I can text you in case anything
changes."</p><p class="standard">While I wrote down my number, Mary kept asking me questions about
Lucy. I answered them, although I couldn't remember her and Lucy ever
hanging out much. I mostly remembered Lucy following me and Elz
around. When I had finished, I handed her the slip of paper.	</p><p class="standard">"Well, I'll text you if anything changes. I'd like to hang
out for a minute, but I'm supposed to be meeting some people. We have
a study group."</p><p class="standard">"Really? For what class?" asked Sophia.</p><p class="standard">"Um, econ."</p><p class="standard">"James just failed his econ test, and he could probably use
some help studying for the next one," said Sophia.</p><p class="standard">"Well, if you want to come along, I'm sure we could fit in
one more person..."</p><p class="standard">I wanted to stomp on Sophia's foot, but she could kill me if I
made her mad, so I just smiled and said, "I also have something
to do right now, but maybe some other time."</p><p class="standard">"Okay. Well, it was good seeing you, and tell Susie if she
needs anyone to hang out with at the party, I can drop by and show
her the ropes."</p><p class="standard">"Thanks. By the way, how is Elz doing? Is she in college?"</p><p class="standard">Once again, that complex expression passed over Mary's face.
"Beth became a lesbian and ran away with some Italian chick just
after her eighteenth birthday. None of us have seen her in four
years. We think she's somewhere in the Midwest, but that's about all
we know."</p><p class="standard">A moment of awkward silence passed. "Oh," I said. "This
will sound stupid, but I always sort of had the impression that she
liked me."</p><p class="standard">Mary laughed, sounding surprisingly bitter. "Me too."</p><p class="standard">Another moment of awkward silence passed. "Well, I'd better
get to my study group," said Mary. "It was good seeing you,
James. Definitely come by some time if you want to study with us."</p><p class="standard">"Sure," I said. "Good seeing you too."</p><p class="standard">Once Mary had gone, Sophia and I returned to the car in the
parking lot. "So, what was the nature of your relationship with
this Elizabeth person? I ask as a suspicious girlfriend," Sophia
said as we pulled out of the parking lot.</p><p class="standard">"You have no right to assume that role when you're not a
girl and not my friend, even if you're the most suspicious person
I've ever met."</p><p class="standard">"How can you say I'm not a girl? If you doubt that, check
under my skirt sometime!"</p><p class="standard">"You may have girl parts down there, but a real girl's girl
parts don't shrivel guys into dust."</p><p class="standard">"And aren't we friends at this point?"</p><p class="standard">"In your fantasies. I'm just taking advantage of you for the
food and the nice house. We're friends in the way that the shark and
the remora are friends."</p><p class="standard">"And what's so suspicious about me?"</p><p class="standard">"Everything. The moment I saw you, I suspected you of
something. Why do you think I followed you and found out what you
really are?"</p><p class="standard">"Point taken. But I'll repeat my question, and this time
I'll ask as a suspicious non-girl non-friend in a shark-remora
relationship."</p><p class="standard">"Elizabeth and I were friends," I said. "Not in a
shark-remora way. It was more like when a chronic gambler gets
together with an alcoholic, and instead of keeping each other
straight, he teaches her to gamble and she teaches him to drink and
you get a couple of alcoholic gamblers, both up to their eyeballs in
debt with bar tabs and poker losses."</p><p class="standard">"Sounds pathological," Sophia remarked.</p><p class="standard">"Sure was. We first met at the Catholic school. To be
specific, we were in a men's bathroom at the Catholic school. To be
even more specific, I was in the bathroom, and she was in the
janitor's closet inside the men's bathroom."</p><p class="standard">"I don't even want to know how this story ends."</p><p class="standard">I laughed. "You're unexpectedly prudish for a succubus."</p><p class="standard">I had managed to keep myself awake through the visit to the
sorority, but once we were back at Sophia's house, the weight of my
tiredness came crashing down on me. I staggered as I preceded her
through the front door. "What time is it?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"Two o' clock," said Sophia.</p><p class="standard">Sue usually spent Sundays at the mall with her friends, so she
probably wouldn't be home until the evening. That meant I had to stay
up until the evening if I wanted to call her. But I needed sleep so I
could stay up all night and chase after Brian. 
</p><p class="standard">I went upstairs and set the alarm clock to six. That way I'd at
least get four hours of sleep before I had to chase Brian around
anymore. Then I'd get up and call Sue and go find Brian again. I
didn't really know what I was planning to do once I'd found him, but
I had to do something. Even if I didn't think the world was missing
much by losing these guys, I couldn't stand the thought of that smug
bastard Langston winning.</p><p class="standard">So I set the alarm to six and went to sleep, with every
confidence I would wake up.</p><p class="standard">And I did wake up.</p><p class="standard">But not at six.</p><p class="standard">When I awoke to a pitch-black room, with a sinking feeling in my
stomach, my cell phone told me it was two in the morning.</p><p class="standard">So Travis Coates was almost certainly dead.</p><p class="standard">Possibly some other members of the football team.</p><p class="standard">I wanted to scream.</p><p class="standard">I felt nauseous.</p><p class="standard">I wanted to throw up.</p><p class="standard">I forced myself not to scream or throw up. 
</p><p class="standard">My mind leaped around, wondering what to do, and my heart leaped
with it, threatening to leap straight out of my chest. I could even
feel the pulse in my throat beating in 6/8 time with my heart.</p><p class="standard">I could go find Brian and try to stop him, replicating the wild
success I'd had with that last night.</p><p class="standard">I could go across the hall, bang on Sophia's door, and offer her
sexual favors in return for information on how to stop a taxim from
killing its alleged murderers.</p><p class="standard">I got out of bed, took a deep breath, and tried to calm myself
down a little. Neither of those options was likely to produce any
results.</p><p class="standard">So instead, I called Sue.</p><p class="standard">I didn't expect her to be awake at this time, but I figured I
could leave a message, and maybe forcing myself to not freak out long
enough to leave a message would calm me down so I could make a
rational choice about what to do.</p><p class="standard">Surprisingly, though, she picked up.</p><p class="standard">"Got that date?" she asked.</p><p class="standard">"Yeah." I was shocked at how calm my voice was. I
didn't feel calm at all. My hands were shaking on the phone receiver.
"It's Friday night." Mary had never told me an exact time.
I assumed there was some party hour that was universally agreed upon
by party people as the starting time for parties.</p><p class="standard">"Cool, thanks."</p><p class="standard">"Also, I talked to Kenneth, and he told me you used to
date."</p><p class="standard">"Yeah."</p><p class="standard">"He was confused about why you broke up with him. He was
asking me if you'd ever consider getting together with him again. I
know he's not your dream guy, but a guy like that might work twice as
hard for you to hold on to you. You might consider giving him another
chance."</p><p class="standard">I said this despite the misgivings I had felt when I spoke to
Kenneth, because those misgivings weren't rational. So I had thought,
so I had told myself ever since the time when I became the one who,
for Kenneth's benefit, had set a taxim on a bunch of probably
innocent guys.</p><p class="standard">"Did Kenneth tell you anything about the situation behind
our breakup?" Sue asked.</p><p class="standard">"He just said you probably thought he was a dork."</p><p class="standard">Sue made a derisive sound. "Figures. I didn't break up with
Kenneth because he was a dork. I broke up with him because he's a
raging racist."</p><p class="standard">"Huh?"</p><p class="standard">"Yeah, that 'gun club' that Brian's and Kenneth's parents
are in, it's basically one of those vigilante military groups that's
trying to prepare for a race war between black people and white
people. They go out there and eat pancakes and shoot
guns and talk about how black people are chimps who knife each other
over brightly colored things like watermelon, and they listen to the
books on tape version of <i>Mein Kampf </i>because
they're all too dumb to read."</p><p class="standard">"And Kenneth is—"</p><p class="standard">"Kenneth is way more into it than
Brian was. In fact, last I heard, Brian was trying to figure out how
to tell his parents he didn't believe the race war was coming and
wanted to leave the gun club. He wanted to tell them, but he wanted
to still have parents when he was done. Kenneth, on the other hand,
bought an Uzi to carry in his waistband. He showed it to me when I
went over to his house. He called it his 'nigger-hunting gun'. That
was when I broke up with him. Later he sent me the most delightful
text, telling me I deserved to be 'raped by niggers in every hole
until dead'."</p><p class="standard">I felt a cold, tingling chill down my
spine. The most peculiar combination of pleasure and revulsion.</p><p class="standard">I was pleased because I knew what was
going on. It was the pleasure of seeing things that hadn't made sense
come together and begin to make sense.</p><p class="standard">I was revolted because if I was right,
there was no other way to feel about it.</p><p class="standard">"I have to go," I said. I
didn't even wait for Sue's response; I hung up right away and began
throwing my clothes on.</p><p class="standard">I considered waking Sophia as I left
the room, but decided against it. She wouldn't help me. Better to let
her sleep than suffer her moralizing.</p><p class="standard"></p>

      <h2 class="heading"><a id="Chapter_10"></a></h2>
      <div class="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard">It was creepy as hell, walking
alongside the dirt road, through the dead grass alongside the dry
ditch at two in the morning.</p><p class="standard">Kenneth, like most people in Donner's
Rest, didn't live in town; he lived in a little house on the edge of
town, plopped in the center of a big dead field and sandwiched
between walnut orchards on either side. I had ridden the bus to the
furthest edge of town, then gotten off to walk the rest of the way,
about five miles of dirt road.</p><p class="standard">I had been in places like this at
times like this before. I was used to the rustling of coyotes and
skunks in the bushes, the noise of the wind through the trees, the
distant howl of rampaging drug addicts cutting copper wire from the
tops of power poles. That wasn't the part that was creepy as hell.</p><p class="standard">It was that, being out here alone like
this, I couldn't stop thinking about my eerie moonlight stroll
alongside Brian last night. Brian, who was no longer human, in a way
that Dazai couldn't have imagined.</p><p class="standard">Also, I was going to accuse a heavily
armed and mentally unstable racist of a crime. I was going to be
alone in his house, accusing him.</p><p class="standard">It would be the perfect time to kill
me.</p><p class="standard">The perfect chance to try out his
nigger-hunting Uzi.</p><p class="standard">But I didn't think he would. 
</p><p class="standard">After all, I didn't have any evidence.
</p><p class="standard">I shouldn't be a threat to him.</p><p class="standard">As I came up Kenneth's front driveway,
his normal front driveway with its normal garden hose and normal
woodpile, so unlike the front driveway of a murdering racist, a dog
started barking. It was a big, dumb, slobbering thing, some kind of
Mastiff, but it was contained behind a fence, so I ignored it.</p><p class="standard">I hate dogs.</p><p class="standard">Especially Mastiffs.</p><p class="standard">There was a white and orange U-Haul
truck parked along the side of the house, and something about its
presence gave me a bad feeling. I rang the doorbell, and though I had
half-expected this, I still felt a small thrill run up my spine when
the one who answered the door was not Kenneth, nor his sleepy, angry,
racist parents, but Langston.</p><p class="standard">"Well, well, young James! I do
declare," Langston did declare in his Georgia drawl. "Come
in, come in!"</p><p class="standard">I followed Langston into the front
hall. "Young Kenneth and Ah were just in the process of makin a
small wager as to whether or not you would figure out who the real
culprit was in Brian Thompson's most unfortunate death, and here you
ah, so it seems the winner is decided."</p><p class="standard">"Here I am," I agreed.
"Which side did you take in the bet?"</p><p class="standard">"Yours, of course. You and I are
similar, young James, though we differ by a good few years. When I
was your age, I had the world ahead of me. I was a Hahvad boy. It
took three years of study in business school and another five years
on the job before Ah knew I'd never leave behind my attraction to the
darker things in life—somethin, I would wager, you've already
come to see about your own self. So you see, James, bettin on you is
really like bettin on myself—and I always bet on myself. But
Ah'm ramblin, and you didn't come all this way to hear an adult
ramble—you came here to confront Kenneth with what you know.
This way, please."</p><p class="standard">Langston led me through into a small,
dim kitchen, lit by a couple of naked 40-watt bulbs hung from the
ceiling, where Kenneth was seated at the table. "Seems you
lose," said Langston. 
</p><p class="standard">Kenneth scowled at him, his pale skin
taking on a sickly glow in the low light. He handed Langston a bill
and then looked at me. "No, he's the real loser here. Why'd you
come?"</p><p class="standard">"Because I finally figured out
who killed Brian Thompson, why, and how Langston ended up involved in
this," I said.</p><p class="standard">"Tell me. Brian was a good
friend, ever since we were kids," Kenneth sneered.</p><p class="standard">When I'd first spoken to him in the
restaurant, I'd felt as if his words—his shaky, spineless,
hemming, hawing words—were telling me a lie which his
contempt-filled eyes couldn't uphold. Now his words were filled with
every ounce of contempt he could muster, every bit of hate he had.
And I found I didn't mind. If this was going to be my last stand, at
least I would still get the last laugh.</p><p class="standard">So I laughed.</p><p class="standard">"You must have thought you were
so clever, coming up with this stupidly, unnecessarily baroque scheme
just to kill off one traitor to his race and a few uppity Negros."</p><p class="standard">"I <i>am </i>clever,"
Kenneth snarled.</p><p class="standard">"Sure you
are. When you heard that Brian had lost faith in God and the race
war, the little gears in your head started turning. Did he tell you
directly, or did you hear it through the rumor mill? He told you
himself, didn't he? 'Ken, man. Dude. Like. I donno how to tell my
parents I'm not a racist anymore. You know?' Something like that?"</p><p class="standard">"Which came
first, I wonder?" I continued, starting to enjoy myself. "Did
he become an atheist and then start questioning the rest of what he'd
been taught? Or did he realize the race war wasn't coming and then
find that God wasn't answering any of his prayers for a way out of
the St. Hitler's Pancake Breakfast Club?"</p><p class="standard">"Oh, the race
war is coming," said Kenneth. "You'll see. They won't spare
nigger lovers like you  and your whore of a sister, either. They'll
tear you apart like the chimpanzees they are."</p><p class="standard">"So you
wanted to kill Brian," I said. "But you yourself said you
weren't up to killing someone. You knew if you went to court and your
defense was 'Your Honor, I killed him because he was a traitor to the
white race', they'd slam your ass behind bars so hard you wouldn't be
able to sit down until Big Mike came to use you, after which you
still wouldn't be able to sit down. So you couldn't just gun Brian
down in the parking lot. You needed someone else to do the dirty
work. You started looking, and you found Langston here. Langston will
do anything if there's money in it, so he agreed to take the job."</p><p class="standard">"Now I
resemble that remark," said Langston.</p><p class="standard">"You must
have somehow stolen the money to pay him, probably by buying credit
card numbers on the Internet." I saw Kenneth's face twitch with
displeasure, and I knew that I'd nailed it—not only had he
bought stolen credit card numbers, he'd actually thought he was
clever for buying stolen credit card numbers. "You paid Langston
to kill Brian Thompson with that money. But that was just the down
payment. You also promised Langston that he could make extra money by
bringing Brian and the others back to life after they'd been killed."</p><p class="standard">"Because you
didn't just want them dead, did you? You may be a sci-fi guy, but I'm
sure you're familiar enough with fantasy to know what a real
necromancer can do. A real necromancer could make those guys in death
what they'd never be in life—your slaves. So you came up with
this plan, to make Brian a taxim, convince him the others killed him
because they were jealous, and have him kill them all. But they
wouldn't really be dead—if they were, you couldn't have
Langston here bring them back as zombies, at once earning more money
for him and creating a gang of black slaves for you."</p><p class="standard">Kenneth was
staring at me in disgust, but Langston said, "Bravo, James! Very
nicely deduced. I knew I was correct to bet on you."</p><p class="standard">"So what're
you gonna do about it?" Kenneth asked sulkily.</p><p class="standard">"Stop you
somehow."</p><p class="standard">"Ah'm afraid
that's out of the question, James," said Langston. "You
see, the members of the Jerry Rice High School football team are
already dead."</p><p class="standard">"Brian
would've taken weeks to walk to all those houses," Kenneth
sneered. "So we helped him along a little."</p><p class="standard">"I
induced him to step on a treadmill, which I then loaded in the truck
you see out back," said Langston.
"This let Brian visit all the houses in one evening, and greatly
accelerated the progress of our plan."</p><p class="standard">"And now
those niggers are my slaves, just like it should be," said
Kenneth.</p><p class="standard">A hulking form
appeared at the door to the kitchen. I recognized the massive
shoulders and thick tree trunk legs of Blake Darnell, once a star of
the football team, now standing in the kitchen of a racist, his dead
yellow eyes empty of all thought and emotion. I noticed Kenneth had
picked up a carved stick from the table, made, ironically, from
African oak. My mother had a mask carved from the same material hung
on the sitting room wall.</p><p class="standard">"Come on,
James," said Kenneth. "Haven't you ever thought someone was
better off dead?"</p><p class="standard">"Of course,"
I said. "I've also thought that I'd like to have slaves.
Specifically, I'd like to have former French first lady Carla Bruny
as a slave. If you know what I mean. But I never thought about
resorting to something as scuzzy as identity theft to get what I
want."</p><p class="standard">Kenneth laughed.
"Morality is just something the weak whine about to the strong,
because they've got nothing else to say. I learned that from Ayn
Rand."</p><p class="standard">It was always Ayn
Rand nowadays.</p><p class="standard">"Let's see
how moral you are when I shoot your ass," said Kenneth. He had a
gun on the table—not his Uzi, a handgun—which he took in
his right hand, shifting the wooden stick to his left hand.</p><p class="standard">"I'm afraid I
can't allow that," said Langston.</p><p class="standard">Kenneth
stared at Langston. "You can't <i>allow</i>it? You're not my dad, dumbass."</p><p class="standard">"Of course,
and proud of it. But Ah am the man whose ass is on the line if young
James goes missin—after all, there are people who know that he
and I met. And I promise you that if I am made to appear in court,
your name will not be absent from the proceedings. Aside from that,
young Kenneth, there are many, many ways in which someone of my
profession can gain retribution against those who cross him."</p><p class="standard">Kenneth looked
distinctly unhappy, but he set the gun down. "Fine. There's
nothing he can do about it anyway. He's got no proof. No one will
believe him if he tries to say the niggers became zombies."</p><p class="standard">And that was
really what it came down to.</p><p class="standard">I had no proof.</p><p class="standard">And no one would
believe me if I tried to say those fine young African-American
gentlemen had become zombies.</p><p class="standard">Langston escorted
me down the front walk. I can't say I particularly liked walking in
the creepy dark with a creepy necromancer who was willing to kill
eleven teenagers for the relatively paltry sum of $110,000. But he
had, for whatever reason, spared my life.</p><p class="standard">"You lost
today, James, but that don't mean you have to like it," Langston
said.</p><p class="standard">"Quoting
<i>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade </i>isn't
going to make you sympathetic after what you did."</p><p class="standard">Langston laughed.
"James, nothing is going to make people sympathetic to me,
because I'm a man who always gets what he wants. No one has sympathy
to spare for a man such as me, and I don't need it even if they have
it."</p><p class="standard">"Why did you
really spare me?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"When Ah
decide what action to take, I first think on whether there's money in
it. If there's no money in it, I go with my gut. There was no money
in killin you, and my gut said, in any wager between you and Kenneth,
I should place my bet on you every time. My gut said it'd bring more
grief than it'd allay, leastaways to me. Maybe that ain't so for
young Kenneth. But that's none of my concern."</p><p class="standard">"Ah, now I
see. You're softening me up for the sales pitch, aren't you?"</p><p class="standard">Langston
laughed again. He had an annoying, horsey gut laugh, befitting his
habit of following his gut. "Very nicely deduced again, James!
And here you are. My card." He produced a business card from
somewhere inside his sleeve. I took the card. It said simply Tyler
Langston, Businessman above a
phone number. </p><p class="standard">"I'll be sure
to call if I ever need to turn my board of directors into zombies,"
I said.</p><p class="standard">Langston laughed
his annoying horsey gut laugh for the third and final time that
night. "Then with that, I say adios to you," he said. "I'll
be occupied for the next week collecting the rest of my payment from
the parents of the other football players. But just you remember the
most important thing about me—as you yourself said, I'll do
anything if there's money in it."</p><p class="standard">With that, he was
gone.</p><p class="standard">Even though I had
just finished sleeping for almost twelve hours, I was so tired that I
nearly got on the bus back to my house, rather than heading for my
court in exile at Sophia's house. When I got back, it was four in the
morning; Sophia was still asleep, so I sneaked up to the room and
collapsed on the bed in my clothes, just barely conscious enough to
kick my shoes off. 
</p><p class="standard">I didn't really
sleep, though. I dozed off for a while, and had some kind of dream
about Kenneth ordering Blake to anally rape me while Lucy watched,
which ended when the phone rang.</p><p class="standard">I flipped the
phone open. It was Sue.</p><p class="standard">"What the
hell is going on?" she asked when I answered. "My friends
all texted me. They're all saying the whole football team is dead!"</p><p class="standard">"The whole
football team isn't dead, as far as I know. But the whole starting
lineup is," I said.</p><p class="standard">"How?!"</p><p class="standard">"It's—"</p><p class="standard">Of course I
couldn't tell her those fine young gentlemen had become zombies.</p><p class="standard">"It's
Kenneth. He killed Brian for trying to leave the gun club. The snake
attack was faked. Then he killed the rest of them somehow."</p><p class="standard">"How? Did he
shoot them? Run them over? What? How did they all die, and why hasn't
he been arrested?"</p><p class="standard">"I can't
explain how he did it, and there's no proof," I said. "But
trust me. I know he did it."</p><p class="standard">The line went
silent for a minute, and I thought she'd hung up. But her voice came
again. "I need to tell you something."</p><p class="standard">"Okay."</p><p class="standard">"Promise me
you won't get all Puritanical."</p><p class="standard">"Okay."</p><p class="standard">"I think
Kenneth has been stalking me."</p><p class="standard">It wouldn't have
surprised me. "Why do you say that?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"A few weeks
ago, I was at a party. I left my drink on the counter and went to the
bathroom. Then I came back. I was about to pick it up, when I saw
Brian watching me with a really creepy expression. Then he shook his
head—just a little bit, but I caught it. I tossed the drink out
and left the party."</p><p class="standard">"So you think
Kenneth spiked the drink and Brian was warning you?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"Yeah."</p><p class="standard">"Are you sure
you didn't misunderstand?"</p><p class="standard">"Well, look,
I said Brian was trying to figure out how to tell his parents he
didn't want to be a racist anymore, right? The thing is, no one knew
about that except me. Brian texted me about a month ago and asked if
I'd meet him at the mall after school to talk about something. Who
knows why, but he somehow decided that I was the person to come out
to about the whole thing. He asked me not to tell anyone, and I never
did. But somehow Kenneth knew about it."</p><p class="standard">"So you think
Kenneth might have been spying on you when you and Brian were
talking."</p><p class="standard">"Yeah."</p><p class="standard">"Why didn't
you tell someone about this?"</p><p class="standard">"Because I
didn't have any proof, and I didn't want people to think I was the
kind of girl who would make false accusations against someone!"
Sue burst out. "But Brian <i>died</i>, and I couldn't think of
anyone who'd kill him besides Kenneth, so I emailed Lucy and asked
her what to do, and she said you would handle it. So I tried telling
you, but I didn't have any proof, and talking to you always feels so
weird, and I panicked and just ended up telling you Brian and Blake
had bullied Kenneth so you'd have some reason to look into him!"</p><p class="standard">Ah, sweet Lucy.
Your faith in me is truly wide and deep. But honestly, I could have
figured this out a long time ago if you'd just told me the truth
instead of coyly comparing Kenneth to Amber. 
</p><p class="standard">I sighed and
grasped my forehead, trying to decide what to do. "Okay, I
assume you won't consider going to Mom or the cops with this, right?"</p><p class="standard">"What'd be
the point? There's still no proof that Kenneth did anything."</p><p class="standard">She was right. Our
local cops wouldn't do anything just because a hysterical teenage
girl turned up and claimed she was being stalked. I'd seen cases
where someone turned up saying a friend or relative had been
murdered, and they still hadn't done anything.</p><p class="standard">"All right,
whatever you do, don't go to school. Kenneth will be there."</p><p class="standard">"You don't
think he'll just come after me?"</p><p class="standard">"He has to
maintain an appearance of normalcy. So he'll be at school. If he
comes after you, it'll be sometime after school gets out. He thinks
he's clever, but he doesn't want to get caught, so he'll come after
you in some covert way. So make sure you're surrounded by people all
day—don't stay at home alone. Go hang out in the mall or in a
cafe or something. After school gets out, go home, but make sure Mom
or Dad is there."</p><p class="standard">"All right.
I'll—I'll do that. Um, thanks."</p><p class="standard">"You're my
sister," I said.</p><p class="standard">The atmosphere was
threatening to get all emotional, so I added, "Of course, I
can't stand to see that piece of shit win, so..."</p><p class="standard">"And all this
time, I thought you were just peeping on women and stealing panties,"
said Sue, doing her part to make sure this didn't get all emotional.</p><p class="standard">"That's
mostly what it is. The other stuff is a side business. Anyway, call
me if anything happens."</p><p class="standard">"All right.
Um...Thanks again. Bye."</p><p class="standard">I had wanted to
make a big speech, to tell her that her reputation at school wasn't
worth her life, that Mom and Dad would listen to her and she should
go to them, but I knew it was no good. High school girls live and die
by their reputations, after all. They're like the Amish: being
shunned is the worst punishment they can imagine.</p><p class="standard">I went downstairs.</p><p class="standard">Sophia was up,
cooking breakfast. "Good morning. Where did you go last night?"</p><p class="standard">"Classified
information," I said.</p><p class="standard">"Oh, okay.
Only, it sounded like maybe you solved the case."</p><p class="standard">"I'm not some
Raymond Chandler character. I don't 'solve cases'. And what do you
care, you wouldn't help me anyway."</p><p class="standard">"I don't
care," Sophia said. "I just thought I'd give you the chance
to show off to a cute girl."</p><p class="standard">"We've been
over this: not a girl, and really not cute, especially when you say
so yourself."</p><p class="standard">"And I didn't
say I wouldn't help you," she added. "I do have a few
things you don't, like money, and a car, and I'm willing to use them
for your benefit. It sounded like you might be able to use those
things."</p><p class="standard">She was being
surprisingly calm. Usually, when I got snide with her, she would get
that miserable puppy dog look in her eyes and go sulk in her room for
a while. I wanted to ramp it up and see if I could make her crack,
just from sheer spite, but I could use her help after all, so I told
her what had happened last night, getting through my entire story as
she cooked eggs, tomatoes, and bell peppers in olive oil on the
range, and made bruschetta to go with it in the broiler.</p><p class="standard">"I got a
pretty good read on what kind of person Kenneth is," I said.
"He's a petty tyrant and a conceited despot. A middle-class
teenager who read a few mediocre books and decided he was a member of
an elite ruling class of humanity. Everything he does, he does to
make himself feel more powerful. He was going to kill me, even though
it would have actually caused more trouble for him. So he'll
definitely go after Sue. But I just can't figure out how, where, or
when."</p><p class="standard">"There is one
person who knows, other than Kenneth," said Sophia, bringing the
serving platters to the table.</p><p class="standard">"That would
be Langston, I guess."</p><p class="standard">"Bingo—so
why don't we try asking him? It almost seems like he wanted to be
asked. He gave you his card, after all."</p><p class="standard">"Great,
except Langston won't do anything unless there's money in it, and I
don't have any."</p><p class="standard">"I do."</p><p class="standard">I just stared at
her as she poured a cup of coffee for each of us and set mine next to
my plate. It wasn't the first time I had wondered just what motives
this person, this infernal girl-shaped thing in front of me, had for
her actions. It wouldn't be the last time either, unless she stopped
acting so damned inscrutable.</p><p class="standard">"Let's call
Langston right now," said Sophia. "Give me that card."</p><p class="standard">I gave it to her.</p><p class="standard">And she called
Langston.</p><p class="standard">And put him on
speaker phone.</p><p class="standard">"James! I was
hopin I might hear from ya," Langston drawled. "You've
decided to avail yo'self of my services, then?"</p><p class="standard">"I'll be
availing James of your services," said Sophia. "My name
is...Taylor. Liz Taylor."</p><p class="standard">That dork.</p><p class="standard">She had a thing
about Elizabeth Taylor.</p><p class="standard">"I see,"
said Langston. "Well then, Ms. Taylor, perhaps James might tell
me just which of my many talents he'd like to utilize, and then you
and I might settle on a price."</p><p class="standard">"I want
information on Kenneth's plans," I said.</p><p class="standard">"Then you ah
in luck, sir. That information is now available at a bargain price.
Shall we set a base fee of one thousand, with additional charges
dependent upon the nature of the requested information?"</p><p class="standard">I glanced at
Sophia. "That's acceptable," she said. "But what does
the thousand get us?"</p><p class="standard">"It gets you
me, at a meetin place and time of your choice, ready to hear your
questions and tell you what further fees I expect in return for
answering them."</p><p class="standard">I glanced at
Sophia again. "That's acceptable," she said. 
</p><p class="standard">"Can you meet
us at the Santa Robles mall food court, tonight at five?" I
asked.</p><p class="standard">"Certainly.
By the way, Ms. Taylor, I accept only cash, so please be sure to
bring a substantial amount of it. I wouldn't like for any of your
questions to go without answers over a silly little thing like
money."</p><p class="standard">"Of course,"
said Sophia.</p><p class="standard">After that, we ate
in silence. Then she made me go to school.</p><p class="standard">I spent the entire
day in a haze. Not a single word said by any of the teachers
penetrated my skull. I was already well on my way to failing my next
round of tests, but I didn't care.</p><p class="standard">Sophia and I left
the school after classes were over and drove out to the Santa Robles
mall. The mall was plopped in the middle of another of those big,
empty fields of dead grass that were common out here. The concrete
building, crowned with clothing store marquees, was encircled by
freeway on-ramps and off-ramps, the surrounding roads festooned with
crisscrossing intersections and outersections and intrasections, the
stop lights directing a graceful ballet of cars entering and leaving
the parking lot.</p><p class="standard">It was a big,
giant, ugly building in a big giant ugly field, with too many cars
going to it and too much asphalt around it.</p><p class="standard">Sophia parked, and
we walked to the building. Although it wasn't very hot outside, the
blacktop had already been baking in the sun all day, and as we
crossed the parking lot, it radiated the heat back at us, like a big
convection oven. 
</p><p class="standard">It was strange to
see Langston in the light of day, his saggy Basset hound face looking
over a plate of French fries, his huge, rough hands grasping an
Italian hero sandwich, his black coat incongruous with the warm
weather. He'd chosen a seat at the edge of the food court, just
across from the video arcade. The sounds of Dance Dance Revolution
and screaming children managed to carry over, but the smell of baking
grease and noise of sputtering pans were weaker over here.</p><p class="standard">"Please sit
down, James, and...Ms. Taylor, I presume? Well, well, I see now what
kind of trump card young James has had up his sleeve this whole
time."</p><p class="standard">"Do you know
who I am?" Sophia asked.</p><p class="standard">"Indeed I do
not, if that is meant to suggest you ah not Ms. Liz Taylor, as you
told me on the phone this morning. But I do know <i>what </i>you ah."</p><p class="standard">We sat down, and
Sophia slid an envelope containing one thousand dollars across the
table. Langston took the envelope, weighed it in his hand, smiled,
and put it in his coat. 
</p><p class="standard">"You're not
going to count it?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"I think by
this juncture I know the weight of ten portraits of Mr. Franklin,"
said Langston. "So, what would you like to know?"</p><p class="standard">"That
depends. What is there to tell?" I asked.</p><p class="standard">"What,
haven't you learned the tenses, young James? There's always three
parts to any story: the past, the present, and the future. Now, I'm
willing to give you a bahgain on the past, as it's now past, and as
you've already deduced an admirable amount of it. What do you
say...five hundred for the past?"</p><p class="standard">"What about
the present?"</p><p class="standard">"The present,
I'll include as a free bonus for the past. For the future, there will
be a surcharge."</p><p class="standard">"Fine. Tell
us about the past and the present."</p><p class="standard">Sophia slid him
another envelope, this one containing five hundred dollars. She'd
obsessive-compulsively separated three thousand dollars into
envelopes, one containing one thousand dollars and the rest
containing five hundred dollars, so she had three more of those
envelopes in her shoulder bag.</p><p class="standard">"Thank you
kindly," said Langston. "Well, you've already heard how the
whole plan began. Young Kenneth wanted to kill all those black boys,
along with his childhood friend, Brian Thompson, as young Brian'd had
a change of heart regardin his opinion of the African race. Myself, I
don't have any pahticuluh dislike for black boys, but I never turn
down a business opportunity. Once I heard how those boys was always
fightin, I knew the best way was to make one of 'em into a taxim, and
have him kill the others. Young Brian was the perfect candidate—he
was insistent, that boy, that all them other boys was jealous of him
for his talent."</p><p class="standard">"Kenneth
wanted me to spare the white members," Langston went on. "He
objected to the spillin of white blood. 'Blood's red, Kenneth, no
matter the race of the man it came out of,' I told him, but he
insisted. But it wouldn't be fair, I knew, so I told Brian it was all
ten of those boys that killed him, in the interest of racial
equality."</p><p class="standard">"In the
interest of more money."</p><p class="standard">"Money
transcends race, James, as I'm sure you know. But I kept that little
detail from young Kenneth—he discovered it the next mornin,
along with his classmates, and what a shock it was. And now we come
to the present, young James. Brian Thompson has returned to life now,
and how happy his parents were to have him back. So happy, those ten
thousand dollars they paid me to make it happen were just plain
forgotten."</p><p class="standard">Sophia made a
small noise next to me, and Langston turned his shit-eating grin on
her. "You're thinkin it ain't possible. And of course it ain't
possible, to really bring him back from the other side. But I have a
trick, specific to me, of turnin a taxim into a zombie when his
vendetta's done. And I ordered young Brian, as his master, to return
to his ordinary life, and remember nothin of what passed."</p><p class="standard">"You're a
better necromancer than you ever were a businessman," Sophia
said with an awkward smile.</p><p class="standard">"Like
billiards to golf, Ms. Taylor. And that, James, is the present.
Kenneth doesn't have his whole slave army yet. I don't have all my
money yet. But I will, very soon, just as soon as I finish persuadin
those parents­—with young Brian as my testimonial—that
they really can have their precious children back."</p><p class="standard">"Unless I
stop you," I said.</p><p class="standard">"Unless you
stop me. But you won't do that. I know, James. You may be repulsed,
with every bone in your body, by what I've done. But you know the
right choice is not to impose your morals on those poor parents. They
can have their boys back, and where's the hurt in it? You won't stop
me, James. Even if you could, you've got no reason to."</p><p class="standard">"You're
right," I said. "I couldn't give a damn about the past or
the present. What I want to know about is the future. What is Kenneth
planning to do with his slaves?"</p><p class="standard">"Something
very petty and personal, as Kenneth is a very petty and personal boy.
Any more is another five hundred."</p><p class="standard">Sophia was about
to pay him, but I stopped her with a gesture and sat back in my
chair. I was starting to get pretty hungry. Langston's half-eaten
hero sandwich and French fries were still sitting on his plate,
tempting me to go buy something. I wondered if Sue was in this mall
somewhere, or if she'd found somewhere else to go, or if she was now
home with Mom and Dad.</p><p class="standard">"Brian's
dead," I said.</p><p class="standard">"Yes."</p><p class="standard">"The black
guys from the football team are all dead."</p><p class="standard">"Yes."</p><p class="standard">I stared up at the
roof, watching the tissue paper streamers tied to the vents dangle in
the air currents. "Reason it out, James," Langston urged.</p><p class="standard">"Did you
solve the case?" Sophia asked.</p><p class="standard">"I'm not
Adrian Monk; I don't <i>solve the case</i>," I said. "But I
think I know what Langston here would tell us if we passed him that
envelope. But just so you don't feel like the day was completely
wasted, Langs baby, let's make a deal. I'm going to say what I think
Kenneth is planning. Liz Taylor here will pay you a hundred dollars
to nod your head yes if I'm right, or shake your head no if I'm
wrong. If I'm wrong, we'll give you everything we have with us in
return for the correct information."</p><p class="standard">"Double or
nothin. Show me the cards," said Langston.</p><p class="standard">"Sue told me
that after she broke up with Kenneth, he sent her a text saying she
should be 'raped by niggers in every hole until dead'. I'd forgotten
about that until now, because there was so much else going on, and it
didn't seem important. But that's his plan. He wants to make that
really happen, and he can, now that he has five black guys completely
under his control, ready to rape whenever he orders it. Now he just
has to figure out where. It's hard to pull off at school, because
those guys will be recognized. He can't risk attacking her at home,
because it might be traceable to him, so he has to do it somewhere
public, somewhere with lots of suspects, where he won't be singled
out. Somewhere like a party."</p><p class="standard">I made the gimme
gesture at Sophia. She stared back, not getting it, so I said, "Lemme
borrow your phone. I want to check something."</p><p class="standard">Sure enough, Sue
had posted on Facebook that she was going to the Alpha Beta Gamma
party on Friday night.</p><p class="standard">"Liz, pay the
man. Langs baby, nod yes or shake no."</p><p class="standard">Langston took the
hundred dollar bill from Sophia. "I knew you'd figure it out,
but a small part of me was hopin you wouldn't," he said. And he
nodded.</p>

      <h2 class="heading"><a id="Chapter_11"></a></h2>
      <div class="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard">Friday
night.</p><p class="standard">Sophia
and I were sitting in her car, in the parking lot of the Alpha Beta
Gamma sorority house, waiting for Sue to arrive. </p><p class="standard">After
Langston had left, I had gone to Sbarro's and made Sophia buy me
food. Then, between bites, I had explained to her how I wanted to
proceed.</p><p class="standard">The
way I saw it, Kenneth needed Sue's rape to happen somewhere public,
where almost anyone could be guilty. The party was perfect—girls
got raped at college parties all the time, and rarely was anyone held
responsible.</p><p class="standard">I
was sure Kenneth would let her know it was him. He had to. He was
like a James Bond villain—he needed to let everyone know how
clever he was, or there was no point in doing any of it. And again,
the party provided him with cover; even if Sue accused him, he just
had to say he didn't do it. As long as he didn't get his own jollies
with her and left it up to his slaves, even the Crime Semen
Investigation unit would have a hard time finding any evidence that
he was involved, and with our local cops being how they were, it was
unlikely they'd ever get the CSIs involved.</p><p class="standard">As
for how he'd get her alone, I had two guesses. Either he'd try to
drug her again, then have his slaves drag her off somewhere, or else
he'd have them attack her in some isolated place, like the bathroom
or the basement, and overpower her.</p><p class="standard">Sue
was meeting up with Mary Gault at the party. I had hooked them up.</p><p class="standard">I'd
had four choices.</p><p class="standard">I
could tell Sue that Kenneth was likely to come after her so she could
be on her guard.</p><p class="standard">I
could tell Mary that Kenneth was likely to come after Sue so she
could be on her guard.</p><p class="standard">I
could tell both Mary and Sue that Kenneth was likely to come after
Sue, so they could both be on their guards.</p><p class="standard">I
could tell neither of them, and Kenneth would catch them both totally
off guard.</p><p class="standard">My
first impulse was to go with the Mary Sue option. That had also been
my first impulse when I'd written my first, disastrous, novel. It had
gotten me into trouble then, and I had anticipated it getting me into
trouble now.</p><p class="standard">So
I hadn't told either of them. </p><p class="standard">After
all, what I wanted here was for Kenneth's plan to mostly succeed.</p><p class="standard">So
Sophia and I were sitting in the parking lot.</p><p class="standard">We
were waiting for Sue to arrive.</p><p class="standard">We
were waiting for Kenneth to arrive.</p><p class="standard">And
when Sue did arrive, I was going to sneak into the party and follow
her around. I was going to watch Kenneth carry out his plan. </p><p class="standard">Then
I was going to burst in, grab the stick, take control of the zombies,
and beat up Kenneth. </p><p class="standard">I
was even willing to kill Kenneth if I had to.</p><p class="standard">"Are
you sure it was a good idea not to warn her that Kenneth would be
after her?" Sophia asked.</p><p class="standard">"It's
academic now."</p><p class="standard">"I'm
surprised that you'd put your sister at such risk. She may not be the
one you have an incestuous flirtation with, but still, she's your
sister."</p><p class="standard">I
didn't bother to answer her. I couldn't imagine she even remembered
her own siblings' faces after two hundred years, if she'd even had
any. She didn't understand that my whole reason for putting Sue at
risk like this was to make sure Kenneth could never threaten Sue
again.</p><p class="standard">"Strange,
I'd have expected her to be here by now," I said. "She's
usually not late to a party."</p><p class="standard">"How
do you know what time she gets to parties?" Sophia asked.</p><p class="standard">"You
should know me well enough by now to answer that."</p><p class="standard">"You
spied on her?"</p><p class="standard">"Of
course."</p><p class="standard">"You're
despicable."</p><p class="standard">"Thank
you for your judgment, Daffy, it will be duly noted in—" I
stopped.</p><p class="standard">My
phone was ringing.</p><p class="standard">It
was Sue.</p><p class="standard">I
answered it.</p><p class="standard">"Sue?"</p><p class="standard">The
line was definitely open, but she wasn't speaking. </p><p class="standard">Then
someone screamed.</p><p class="standard">"I'm
at a 7-11 near the college!" Sue's voice came, just before the
line was cut off.</p><p class="standard">I
felt my blood run cold.</p><p class="standard">I
threw open the door to Sophia's car and ran out into the night, my
cell phone still in my hand, my heart racing, back towards the
nightlife area, knowing I'd never make it. The nearest 7-11 was at
least five blocks away from the end of the campus nearest to
nightlife area. The Alpha Beta Gamma house was at the opposite end
from that end.</p><p class="standard">Nevertheless,
I pounded my shoes into the pavement. </p><p class="standard">Stupid,
stupid, stupid! Both of us—me, for thinking I'd known exactly
what Kenneth would do, and Kenneth, for not doing what I'd thought he
would, and instead attacking Sue in the middle of the street. </p><p class="standard">I
should have told Mom. Even if it meant betraying Sue's trust.</p><p class="standard">Now
I'd never make it in time.</p><p class="standard">Unless
I could fly.</p><p class="standard">I
felt my shoes lift off the ground.</p><p class="standard">I
felt arms under my armpits, holding me up.</p><p class="standard">I
felt the warmth of two C-cups pressing into my back.</p><p class="standard">"I
know where she is!" came Sophia's voice from behind me. "Don't
worry, I'll get you there in time!"</p><p class="standard">I
had no idea why that second-rate succubus decided to break her
precious rules and fly me to the 7-11, but I was glad she did.</p><p class="standard">I'm
sure the view of the city at night below me was beautiful, but I was
too revved up to notice it. All I could think about was getting to
the 7-11 in time.</p><p class="standard">The
7-11 sat in the middle of an otherwise empty block, pretty far from
anything else on every side. A single streetlight illuminated the
lonely sidewalk outside. I couldn't see another human around, which
explained why Kenneth had chosen this area for his attack.</p><p class="standard">When
we landed, Sophia was mousy and brown and fully clothed again before
I could turn around, although I imagined she must have turned
red-haired and gold-eyed in order to get out her wings and fly us
over.</p><p class="standard">As
we approached the door, I saw through the glass that Kenneth, Sue,
and the five boys, each of them as massive as Blake, were standing
inside. There didn't seem to be a clerk inside. Kenneth was near the
door, blocking Sue's escape, with his zombie slaves standing around
him.</p><p class="standard">Then
Kenneth saw us. </p><p class="standard">"Stay
back!" he yelled, opening the door and raising his Glock. </p><p class="standard">I
dove for cover behind a gas pump just as the deafening crack of a
gunshot split the night. Sophia calmly joined me, sitting down beside
me on the concrete island. </p><p class="standard">"Don't
think he'll be able to do anything for you!" Kenneth said to
Sue. I peeked out from behind the gas pump and saw him waving his gun
around. "He's a loser! He should have died a week ago in my
kitchen!" He raised the African oak stick in his left hand.
"Now, since you love niggers so much, here you go! I've got five
of them for you! Niggers, rape her in every hole until dead!"</p><p class="standard">The
five dead football players started closing in on Sue. Sue backed
away, towards the checkout counter, but there was nowhere to run, and
she and Kenneth both knew it.</p><p class="standard">I
sprung out and ran for Kenneth, hoping I could reach the door before
he could get his gun up. If I could slam the door into him and knock
him off balance...</p><p class="standard">Too
late—Kenneth saw me just as I was about to reach the door and
swung his Glock around. I threw myself to the ground and rolled out
of the line of fire, just as the gun went off and shattered the glass
in the door.</p><p class="standard">"I'll
kill you too, James!" Kenneth yelled, pushing the door open and
bringing the gun around. "I'll—"</p><p class="standard">"Why
would you want to do that?"</p><p class="standard">I
had almost forgotten she was here.</p><p class="standard">Sophia
had come up from her hiding place behind the gas pumps.</p><p class="standard">She
was smiling.</p><p class="standard">Her
lips and her eyes were both smiling, but they weren't smiling the
same smile.</p><p class="standard">"Who
are you?" Kenneth asked. </p><p class="standard">He
sounded awestruck, like he'd just seen a goddess.</p><p class="standard">"I'm
Sophia. I hear you're a very smart, very clever boy, Kenneth."</p><p class="standard">"You
know me?"</p><p class="standard">"I
know a lot of things about you. But I'd like to know more. Would you
like to come with me and tell me? Somewhere private?"</p><p class="standard">Kenneth's
jaw was hanging open. I could almost see him drooling. "Y-yeah.
Yeah, let's—let's go somewhere else. I'll tell you how I made
those niggers my slaves."</p><p class="standard">Sophia
laid a friendly hand on his back and started to guide him away. "You
won't need those things you're holding," she said. "You'll
be filling your hands up with something else."</p><p class="standard">Kenneth
nodded stupidly and dropped the gun and the stick as Sophia led him
across the empty lot, back towards the college.</p><p class="standard">Come
on, man, how can you fall for cheesy, awful pickup lines like that?
If some girl came up to me talking like that, I'd immediately peg her
for a succubus.</p><p class="standard">I
picked up the stick.</p><p class="standard">Sue
had been admirably successful at dodging the zombies—so far she
was still fully clothed and none of them had managed to lay a finger
on her.</p><p class="standard">"Fine
young African American lads!" I cried, and the five zombies
immediately stopped chasing Sue and turned their attention on me.</p><p class="standard">Stop
that, you're giving me stage fright.</p><p class="standard">"I
am your new master. You serve me now. And I am a benevolent master.
So I order you to go home to your parents. Go to sleep. Wake up in
time for school tomorrow morning. Then begin your lives again, newly
filled with love and respect for all people, regardless of race, sex,
ethnicity, national origin, age, or sexual orientation!"</p><p class="standard">The
zombies filed out of the 7-11, crunching broken glass under their
feet as they came out and dispersed in all directions, heading for
their homes.</p><p class="standard">"One
more thing," I added. "After you begin your new lives,
never unthinkingly obey anyone again, especially if they have this
stick!"</p><p class="standard">Sophia
hadn't known whether the stick could give meta-commands to the
zombies, and I hadn't wanted to pay Langston the million dollars
needed to find out. But it couldn't hurt.</p><p class="standard">"And
also don't listen to a man named Tyler Langston," I added to the
five massive backs as the zombies, about to become the football
team's starting members once again, passed the gas pumps and headed
away from the empty lot.</p><p class="standard">Once
the zombies had gone, I turned to Sue. She was flushed and pale as a
radish, her breaths heaving in and out. Her panic made her look
childish, despite the halter top and hot pants she was wearing and
all the makeup she'd piled on. </p><p class="standard">Our
eyes met for just a second, and then she turned away, abashed. "Um,
th-thanks. Um, I won't ask how you got here so quickly, or what the
hell just happened with those guys."</p><p class="standard">"That's
for the best. They won't bother you anymore."</p><p class="standard">"And
I won't ask what your friend just did with Kenneth."</p><p class="standard">"He
won't bother you anymore either. Or anyone else."</p><p class="standard">"Um,
would you take me home? I don't feel like going to the party
anymore."</p><p class="standard">"Let
Mary know. Maybe she'll invite you again."</p><p class="standard">Sue
sent Mary a text saying she wasn't coming, and we started to walk
towards the college, headed for Sophia's car in the Alpha Beta Gamma
parking lot. </p><p class="standard">We
walked in silence for a while. Even though we were only a few blocks
from the nightlife area, the streets in this area were completely
empty. The storefronts and office windows were all dark, the
streetlights shining down on nothing but dust, errant trash, and the
occasional opossum.</p><p class="standard">"Why
did you come over here instead of staying in the nightlife area?"
I asked.</p><p class="standard">"I
freaked out," Sue admitted. "When I realized Kenneth was
following me, I freaked out and started trying to shake him by
leaving the main streets. Then I remembered what they say about going
to a well-lit area with a lot of people, so I went into the 7-11. But
it wasn't enough. Kenneth followed me in and took out his gun and ran
off the clerk. That was the clerk's screaming that you might have
heard when I called," she added. "He was even more scared
than I was."</p><p class="standard">"You
never should have let it get this far," I said. "You should
have told someone."</p><p class="standard">"I
told you," Sue said flatly, "and you protected me. Just
like Lucy said you would."</p><p class="standard">"Yeah,
I'm going to have to talk to her too—she should have told
someone. Mom and Dad would have taken you seriously. You should have
talked to them."</p><p class="standard">"And
told them what?" Sue demanded. "That I'm a tramp who dates
guys and then dumps them, but leaves them so bewitched that they
stalk me?"</p><p class="standard">"Mom
and Dad wouldn't think that," I said. "No one would think
that except your dumb friends at school, and who cares about them?"</p><p class="standard">"That's
easy for you to say. But I'm not like you. I can't stand being hated
and ignored by everyone. And I'm not like Lucy, who gets by because
she's Little Miss Prim and Proper and impresses all the adults with
how seemly she is."</p><p class="standard">"Then
let me put it this way: their opinion isn't worth being killed or
raped over."</p><p class="standard">"I'm
not saying I did everything one hundred percent right, okay?"
said Sue. "But telling an adult wouldn't have helped. They don't
understand."</p><p class="standard">"What
don't they understand?"</p><p class="standard">"How
it is. How any of this is."</p><p class="standard">She
was right.</p><p class="standard">I
wasn't sure if she and I had exactly the same idea of what "how
it is" meant. But she was right. In this case, they would not
have understood, and they had no idea how it was.</p><p class="standard">Whatever
"it" was, they had no idea about it.</p><p class="standard">I
still wanted to argue with her. This case was abnormal. "It"
wouldn't always be how this was, and when it wasn't, telling an adult
was the right thing to do. This case was supernatural.</p><p class="standard">But
she wasn't supposed to know that.</p><p class="standard">"Just...just
be more up front next time," I finally said. "Mom and Dad
won't think you're a tramp, trust me."</p><p class="standard">Sue
didn't respond, but her face looked sullen as we passed under the
white fluorescent glow of a streetlight.</p><p class="standard">"Lucy
thinks I'm a tramp," she said after a moment. "So do you."</p><p class="standard">"I
don't think that. You're not actually sleeping with all these guys,
are you?"</p><p class="standard">"No.
Um, no. I'm still...a virgin."</p><p class="standard">I
didn't know if that was true, but it seemed to cost her a great deal
to say it.</p><p class="standard">"But
Lucy and I can't figure it out," I went on. "Why do you
date so many different guys? Is it just some social thing, some kind
of 'publish or perish' instinct that we don't understand because
we're not cool?"</p><p class="standard">"It's
not," said Sue. </p><p class="standard">"Then
why?"</p><p class="standard">Sue
let the question hang in the air for a minute as we reached the end
of the street. We were across from the college's little park now. I
pressed the button and waited for the signal to turn to 'Walk'.</p><p class="standard">"It's
boring."</p><p class="standard">"Huh?"
I started to look at Sue, but the signal turned and she walked past
me into the crosswalk.  I caught up to her, and we moved across the
wide street towards the campus.</p><p class="standard">"It's
all so boring," she said. "They all said high school would
be different, that it would be harder, but more rewarding. So in my
freshman year, I spent a lot of time on my schoolwork so I could get
good grades. I got straight A's for the year. And when I was done, I
had a report card full of A's and I was so bored I wanted to scream.
So I started dating."</p><p class="standard">"So
you date a bunch of guys because it's more fun than your schoolwork?"</p><p class="standard">"No.
Dating is boring too. These guys are all so boring. But they all have
their little obsessions—Brian and Blake had football, Kenneth
had his video games and his guns and his little dice games. Pete had
soccer, David had writing, Christopher had meditation, Jesse had his
guitar. Jaime had his model trains. Brendan had his computers. Doug
had his cameras. I meet a guy and he's got this little obsession with
something I don't know about, so I start talking to him about it.
Pretty soon we're dating. I get to hear about whatever he's doing,
and everyone thinks I'm a normal girl and no one knows that I'm so
bored with the whole school experience that I just want to scream
every day."</p><p class="standard">"Wait,
so you're dating guys to learn about
their hobbies?" I asked. "Because you're bored?"</p><p class="standard">"Well,
yeah. When I started, I really just wanted to learn how to speak
Spanish, but I kept talking to Ariel and he told everyone we were
dating, and I just went with it. And it's a good way to seem normal.
Lots of girls at school switch boyfriends every few months. Maybe
some girls think I'm a little odd because I don't stick to one
clique, but mostly they leave me alone."</p><p class="standard">"But
I get bored eventually, because these guys are all so lame. You hold
a guy's hand for five minutes and he goes home and whacks off to that
memory for three weeks. They're just lame. So I dump them."</p><p class="standard">"So
you dump them."</p><p class="standard">"Is
there an echo in here?"</p><p class="standard">"So
let me get this straight. You've been dating all these guys so you'll
fit in with the teeny-boppers, and because you're bored and you want
to hear about their hobbies, but then you get bored again and dump
them."</p><p class="standard">"I
guess that's it." She suddenly looked away. I couldn't tell if
she'd turned red; it was dark, and she'd already been pretty flushed.
"Don't you dare tell anyone. Especially Lucy. If you tell Lucy,
I'll tell Mom that you and Lucy slept together and she'll kick you
out of the family for good."</p><p class="standard">"Who
do you think you're talking to?" I said. "I can keep a
secret."</p><p class="standard">When
we reached the Alpha Beta Gamma parking lot, Sophia was already at
the car. She was leaning against the door, and I supposed she was
metaphorically picking her teeth after a sumptuous succubus luncheon
of psychopathic veal.</p><p class="standard">"Good
evening, Sue," she said. "We haven't really met before,
although I think you know who I am."</p><p class="standard">"You're
Sophia," said Sue. "James's girlfriend."</p><p class="standard">"Oh,
do we really look that way? I'm so happy!"</p><p class="standard">"We
really don't look that way," I said.</p><p class="standard">"It
seems like I owe my rescue partially to you too," Sue went on.
"Thanks. I—I appreciate it. A lot."</p><p class="standard">"I
couldn't stand by and let you go through something like that,"
Sophia said with a huge smile. As if she hadn't nearly done just
that. "Are you going to the party?"</p><p class="standard">"Not
tonight."</p><p class="standard">"Then
I'll be glad to drive you home."</p><p class="standard">"Thank
you."</p><p class="standard">Like
I said, it wasn't going to be the last time I wondered about the
motives of this creature.</p>
      </div>
    </div><div class="chapter">
      <h2 class="heading"><a id="Chapter_12"></a></h2>
      <div class="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard">And
that about wraps it up.</p><p class="standard">When
Sophia and I drove Sue home, my mom was there to meet us. She thanked
Sophia for driving her daughter home, completely ignoring me. </p><p class="standard">It
may be trite, but I now saw how ridiculous the thing I'd said during
our fight was—about being treated like a black man in 1950
Alabama. At least my mother had never tried kill me, resurrect me as
a zombie slave, and order me to rape someone.</p><p class="standard">But
she was still mad, and I wasn't going to try and change her mind.</p><p class="standard">So
I went with Sophia back to her house.</p><p class="standard">But
during the ride over, I told her how it was.</p><p class="standard">"I
can't do this again," I said.</p><p class="standard">"Do
what?"</p><p class="standard">"This
thing where I'm risking my life, and not sure if I can count on you
to help me or not. You even held back on telling me how Brian came
back to life until we'd gotten into an argument about it. And when I
asked a few weeks ago, you wouldn't tell me anything about your past
or about supernatural creatures. I understand everyone has secrets
they don't want to tell, but you've got most of mine and I've got
none of yours."</p><p class="standard">"The
rules—"</p><p class="standard">"Yes,
the rules. I understand the rules. What I don't understand is your
assiduity in upholding them. Is following rules really that important
to you? Or is it just that you've been away from humanity so long
that you don't really care about us anymore?"</p><p class="standard">"No."
Sophia shook her head in the darkness. "It's the opposite of
that."</p><p class="standard">"Care
to expand on that?"</p><p class="standard">She
took a heavy breath before she did. "The organization I work for
is called Sunt Absconditores. We work to keep the supernatural hidden
from the human world."</p><p class="standard">"Right,
you're trying to keep all the vampires, soul suckers, and toilet
fingers out of the world of Coca Cola, Middle East crises, and Jerry
Springer. We've been over that," I said.</p><p class="standard">"I
began as a venatrix, a huntress who tracks and captures or kills
those violating the rules. Now I'm more of a special agent."</p><p class="standard">"So
you were completely lying when you claimed you didn't know how to
investigate Austen," I said.</p><p class="standard">"Not
completely lying. But I did exaggerate, because I needed to get you
to work with me."</p><p class="standard">"And
you can't tell me why."</p><p class="standard">"No.
But I can tell you why I follow the rules, why I started working for
Sunt Absconditores, and why I'm still doing it. I told you that I
became a succubus because I was raped by an incubus, right?"</p><p class="standard">"Maybe,
it's kinda fuzzy...Oh, right! That was the time you actually told me
something about yourself. It was totally useless information, but I
guess it was better than nothing."</p><p class="standard">"It
doesn't have to be permanent."</p><p class="standard">"What
doesn't have to be permanent?" I thought she was talking about
her information being useless, but then it dawned on me what she was
saying. "You mean there's a cure for succubusism? A chance you
could become human again?"</p><p class="standard">I
couldn't see her face in the darkness inside the car, so I couldn't
tell how she was reacting. That was part of the reason I was laying
into her like this, letting my anger get the best of me. I'd expected
her to start crying, but she'd managed to keep going long enough to
tell me something genuinely surprising.</p><p class="standard">After
all, none of Anne Rice's characters ever had the option to go back to
being human, so far as I
know.</p><p class="standard">"If
I can find the incubus who turned me," said Sophia, "and
kill him, and expose myself to his blood...there's a chance I can
become human again. But no one knows if it will work after so much
time has passed."</p><p class="standard">"So
there might be a statute of limitations on bathing in the blood of
the incubus who turned you to become human again."</p><p class="standard">"Yes."</p><p class="standard">"And
maybe he died since the last time you saw him, over two hundred years
ago."</p><p class="standard">"No,"
said Sophia. "The last time I saw him was less than ten years
ago. He's still alive."</p><p class="standard">"You
think."</p><p class="standard">"The
last time I saw him, I learned what kind of person he is. He's not
like Austen. He's much smarter, much stronger, and a million times
more dangerous. There's no comparison." She chuckled a little.
"Putting in Dragon Ball terms, Austen is Emperor Pilaf. Diderot
is Lord Freezer."</p><p class="standard">"But
even if he is alive, and even if the statute of limitations hasn't
expired, why would you want to become human again? Why would you give
up eternal life, super healing, flying, all of that, in return
for—for this?" I patted myself on the chest.</p><p class="standard">"Because...I'm
not sure if you'll understand this...It's hard to explain."</p><p class="standard">"Try
me."</p><p class="standard">"I
don't feel good about myself. I don't like what I am. I'm a
self-hating succubus. I can't help watching every man I see in the
street, wondering if he's ever done anything wrong, wondering how
much I would get if I fed on him. I guess in the end, you could say
I'm lonely."</p><p class="standard">I
couldn't believe what I was hearing. "You realize that you just
saved my ass, my sister's ass, and if you'd acted earlier you could
have saved ten teenage boys' asses? Do you realize that this was all
possible because you aren't human? Haven't you ever read Batman? Or
Spiderman? 'With great power comes great responsibility.' You're
shirking that responsibility!"</p><p class="standard">"I'm
not trying to save the lives of individual humans," said Sophia.
"I'm trying to save the human world, itself, from incursion by
the supernatural. I'm trying to protect it so it's there for me on
the day I'm able to return."</p><p class="standard">"So
the lives of individual people don't matter squat to you?"</p><p class="standard">"That's
not what I'm saying. If I did something like that—became a
superhero or something—it would throw off the balance of the
human world. If you're looking for a comic book example, try
<i>Watchmen</i>.
The whole world would be profoundly changed by knowledge of the
supernatural. I don't want to be the one to create that change."</p><p class="standard">"But
you continually bend the rules, just like you did tonight—flying
me over, seducing Kenneth."</p><p class="standard">"The
rules permit me to feed. There was no bending in what I did with
Kenneth. And as for you,  you're an exception. I need you alive."</p><p class="standard">"And
you can't tell me why."</p><p class="standard">"No.
Not right now. But for what it's worth, James, I'll offer you a deal.
From now on, I'll be completely open with you about the supernatural
and about myself—everything except for why I'm here with you.
It's not that I don't trust you, but the mission is so important that
I can't run even the slightest risk that someone could find out what
I'm really doing. But I'll tell you anything else you want to know.
About me, about the others, about the world I'm trying to keep out. I
thought the best thing was to keep it secret, to try to insulate you
from it, but it doesn't seem like I can do that. So. Anything you
want to know."</p><p class="standard">I
didn't respond right away. It was tempting. Everything I wanted to
know about the supernatural. </p><p class="standard">But
it was also tempting to just walk away. To stop hanging out with her,
stop dealing with the supernatural at all. </p><p class="standard">But
if I'd done that, Kenneth wouldn't have been stopped.</p><p class="standard">He'd
be alive right now, plotting against Sue.</p><p class="standard">Or
his plot would have succeeded.</p><p class="standard">And
there was one other benefit in what she'd said. Apparently she needed
me alive.</p><p class="standard">So
I'd have information and a bodyguard.</p><p class="standard">"I
have to think about this," I said. </p><p class="standard">We
reached Sophia's house and split up. She went into her room, and I
went into the guest room.</p><p class="standard">The
next morning, she was gone. It was Saturday, so I assumed she was off
helping the elderly.</p><p class="standard">I
sat down at my computer and wrote up what I'd just been through.</p><p class="standard">Not
all of it, of course. For one thing, I didn't want to call any
attention to Kenneth's disappearance. As far as I was concerned,
Kenneth being gone was for the best. </p><p class="standard">But
I did write about what happened when Langston and I had gone down to
bring back Brian.</p><p class="standard">I
explained away what had happened as a scam, where a con artist had
first faked Brian's death using drugs, then pretended to be a faith
healer and faked his resurrection.</p><p class="standard">I
used fake names. Brian Thompson became 'Rudy'. Langston became 'Pat
Osteen'. </p><p class="standard">I
published it to my blog.</p><p class="standard">Langston
was right; I hadn't thought that stopping him from resurrecting those
boys was the right course of action. If he hadn't brought them back,
they would've been buried alive in the comatose state he'd put them
in, and slept until their bodies really did die, from suffocation. </p><p class="standard">Letting
the parents have their sons back was the right thing to do, even if
Langston did make money from it.</p><p class="standard">But
I'd at least stop him from ever pulling the same con again.</p><p class="standard">Lucy
called me later that morning.</p><p class="standard">"You
should have just told me," I said.</p><p class="standard">"I'm
sorry. Sue gave me a little sister order. I couldn't disobey her."</p><p class="standard">"It
all could've been so much easier if you'd just told me."</p><p class="standard">"I
promised Sue I wouldn't," Lucy repeated.</p><p class="standard">"Well,
don't ever do that again."</p><p class="standard">"By
the way, I talked to Mom last night. She said she saw the news story
about those football team guys who died."</p><p class="standard">"They
weren't really dead."</p><p class="standard">"Mom
didn't know that. And I thought it best not to tell her. Since she
saw how those people lost their sons and decided she couldn't afford
to be mad at you anymore. She asked me to tell you to come home, and
do better on your next round of tests."</p><p class="standard">"Tell
her I'm coming home, but not for a few days. I have a few things to
finalize here."</p><p class="standard">"With
your girlfriend?"</p><p class="standard">"<i>That
</i>isn't
my girlfriend."</p><p class="standard">"She
seems nice, by the way. Tell her I said hello."</p><p class="standard">"I
don't want you talking to her. She's a bad influence on a young girl.
She'll teach you all sorts of bad habits."</p><p class="standard">That
night, I told Sophia that my mother had decided to let me come home.</p><p class="standard">"Too
bad. I'll miss having you here," she said.</p><p class="standard">"You'll
miss having a lazy ingrate that you have to cook for lazing around in
your guest room?"</p><p class="standard">"I'll
miss the company."</p><p class="standard">Yes,
her loneliness. </p><p class="standard">I
could sort of see now why she spent her weekends helping the elderly,
and why she kept enrolling at college. It was a way of keeping in
touch with her human side. </p><p class="standard">A
way of staving off loneliness.</p><p class="standard">"Have
you thought anymore about what we talked about last night?" she
asked.</p><p class="standard">"I
have."</p><p class="standard">"And
what have you decided?"</p><p class="standard">"I
can't do it."</p><p class="standard">Sophia
added salt to her steak. It didn't taste like it needed it to me—if
anything, it was supernatural how good the steaks she'd made were—but
I supposed her motives were, as always, inscrutable.</p><p class="standard">"So
you won't work with me anymore?" she asked.</p><p class="standard">"No.
I can't do this. Maybe last time was your official case and this time
was my personal case, but both times I ended up almost dying because
I had to confront the supernatural on my own, with no idea whether
you had my back or not. I can't do it. If you can't bring yourself to
help me with all the resources you have, including your succubus
abilities, I can't do it."</p><p class="standard">Sophia
nodded. She looked miserable again. "I guess I can't fault you
for that," she said. </p><p class="standard">"So
whatever mysterious plan you have that you can't tell me about,
you'll have to carry it out without my help. Because I can't do it."</p><p class="standard">She
nodded, not looking up from her steak. I felt a slight twinge in my
chest. </p><p class="standard">Some
part of me wanted to take it all back, to tell her it was all right
even if she couldn't give me those guarantees I wanted, to say
whatever I had to say to make her smile.</p><p class="standard">I
wondered if her pheromones were affecting me.</p>
