* Prequel notes
I want to do a prequel story for the wizard story that parallels the beginning of Harry Potter and introduces the heroine.

The heroine is Jenny Carter. She lives with her aunt and uncle, Verna and Robert Bailey, and their son, Ian. The story opens in 2038 with Ian, now 13, going off to join the military.
