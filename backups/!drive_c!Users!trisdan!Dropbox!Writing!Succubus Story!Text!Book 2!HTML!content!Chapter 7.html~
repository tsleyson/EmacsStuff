<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><B>07</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>	In
contrast to the lively nightlife area, the medical district of Santa
Robles was completely dead by night.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>	There
were the usual ambulances coming and going, and the emergency room
was fairly bustling, but the rest of the place was just dead.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
had been to this sprawling medical complex three times before: twice
to get drug tests for my jobs, and once as a child when Lucy had
broken her arm. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">The tower of the
main hospital was far and away the tallest building in Santa Robles,
soaring high above the rest of the small town like the headquarters
of the Tyrell Corporation. The complex was more of a city than a
hospital, although the entire facility had a single address.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	I was supposed to meet this Langston fellow outside the
morgue. The morgue was its own building, standing apart like some
creepy stainless steel crypt, housing the bodies of those who had
died here. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	I had pretended to go study in my room after dinner,
then sneaked out after I'd heard Sophia go to her own room. I don't
know why, but I felt as if I should hide this from her. Maybe I was
just being petulant, because she insisted on keeping secrets from me.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	It was just a short bus ride from her house to the
medical complex, and I had plenty of time to walk around the and
admire the hydrangeas and tulips under the fluorescent street lamps;
I chose not to, and instead went straight for the morgue.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Standing outside the building, on the curb, was a
middle-aged man with dark hair and a long, saggy face like a Basset
hound. As I approached, he reached a huge, rugged hand into his black
coat and took out a cigarette, then noticed me and stopped.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">	&quot;Well,
shoot, I thought I'd have time for a cigarette, but it looks like you
ah here already,&quot; he said in a Southern accent&mdash;not the
Oklahoma or Texas cowboy accent that was fairly common locally, but
more of a Georgia accent, with the </SPAN><I><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">r</SPAN></I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">s
slid off the end. &quot;I take it you ah James Moran?&quot;</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I am. You must be Tyler Langston.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;That Ah am.&quot; He put the cigarette away and
reached out a hand, and I shook it with a rough squeeze. &quot;You'll
pardon mah shock, but I was expecting someone just a tad older.
Still, they do say that youth is a drug that kills all ills&mdash;including
mistrust, I wager.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Do they? How ghastly.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">	Langston
chuckled, and I was reminded of nights watching </SPAN></SPAN><I><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">The
X-Files </SPAN></I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">for
some reason.</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Ah, that was it. The Cigarette Smoking Man. Here he
was, right in front of me.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Well, as we're now both here, Ah suppose we might
get to business,&quot; said Langston. &quot;There was a stated
amount&mdash;a very small fee, for the service being offered...&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;The money is at Western Union,&quot; I told him.
&quot;I have the password, you have the identification.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Of course, payment upon delivery. Though I assure
you, young man--&quot; Langston swept his coat behind him as he
turned towards the entrance of the morgue, &quot;--you shall have no
dissatisfaction at all with my services.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I'll be the judge of that,&quot; I said.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	The doors to the morgue were glass and opened
automatically as we approached. I followed Langston into an empty
lobby. The lights were low, and each footfall made a thunderous echo
as we crossed to the corridor.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Where is everyone?&quot; I asked.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Just on a little break,&quot; said Langston.
&quot;Right now, they're having a real terrible feeling about coming
inside this place, just awful. They're feeling like if they come in
here, someone real important to them might die tomorrow. Maybe Pop
drops dead of a heart attack, or maybe Ma gets run down by a
semi...Maybe some madman runs through Junior's kindergarten with a
gun...They're feeling something like that, though if you asked them
they wouldn't know how to say it.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Langston led me down the corridor. Lining the corridor
were heavy metal doors like airlocks on a submarine, labeled with
numbers. I had no idea what the numbers meant or which room we were
looking for, but it seemed that Langston did, so I followed his lead.
</FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	We descended a staircase and came into another
corridor, also lined with heavy metal doors, and passed along this
corridor for about twenty paces before Langston stopped. He opened
the nearest door, wrenching the titanium lever and pushing it open.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	We came into a dimly lit room. Contrary to what I'd
been expecting, there weren't any of those pull-out freezer chambers
built into the walls that they always have on TV; instead, there was
a neat row of about ten gurneys, each covered by a white sheet. A
chill went through me, and much as I'd like to blame the cold, it was
the realization that those lumps under the sheets were dead bodies.
Laugh at me as you like.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Langston went straight to the nearest gurney and threw
back the sheet, revealing the cold, grey face of a teenage boy. He
was shorter than I'd expected, and nowhere near as bulky as Blake,
but had  obviously been in great shape. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	He was dead, I thought. Where once he had played
football, bored my sister to tears, and engaged in homoerotic rivalry
with Blake, he was now dead.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	For now.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Langston took something out of his coat. &quot;Here,
look at this,&quot; he said, handing it to me. It looked like some
kind of homemade egg timer, a D-cell battery attached to two wires
which ran to a plastic dial. Two alligator clips hung out from the
bottom. Langston took the device back and hooked the alligator clips
to Brian's nipples.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	That was going to hurt if he woke up and found those
clamped on his nipples.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Langston said, &quot;Here's where the magic happens,&quot;
and turned the dial all the way up.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	The dial ran down, making a whirring sound as it went.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	We waited for exactly sixty seconds. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	And Brian's eyes opened.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Brian shot up, heaving breaths in and out, his skin
still pale and grey, but life now in him.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	He blinked.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	He looked around, first at Langston, then at me, and
then around the room, as if he remembered where he was but didn't
trust his memory.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	And then he asked, &quot;Wasn't I dead?&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;You were,&quot; said Langston, &quot;but not
anymore. Your ma and pa paid me good money to see to that.&quot; He
went over to the cabinets around the edge of the room and got out
Brian's clothes and personal effects. &quot;Here you are. Some thief
took all the cash in your wallet, to judge by the difference between
what's in here and what's written on the inventory, but other than
that it seems all your things are here.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Who was it?&quot; Brian asked. He glanced at me,
but I couldn't do any more than look back with a dumbfounded,
sheep-like gaze. &quot;Who killed me?&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Langston smiled. &quot;Sure you want to know? By the
way, James, I'd like that password now, if you don't mind.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	I reached out and touched Brian on the shoulder, just
to make sure he wasn't a rubber doll. He wasn't. And he stared at me
with disgust.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Uh, sure,&quot; I said. &quot;The password's
'America'.&quot; </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;How patriotic. So, Brian, you'd like to know who
it was killed you.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Brian. &quot;Yeah, I wanna
know.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	I had no idea if Langston knew or not. I didn't see how
he could, unless it had been him. But I recalled June telling me how
Langston had known things no one outside the family would know. I
recalled Kenneth&mdash;the more I thought about it, the more I
thought those misgivings I'd had towards him were just the stirrings
of long-forgotten brotherly protectiveness towards Sue. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	But Lucy had warned me not to forget Amber.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	And I hadn't.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Still, something inside me didn't want to let Kenneth
take the blame for this.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Something inside me wanted to make sure the most
blame-worthy people took the blame.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	So I said,</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;It was Blake Darnell.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	I blurted it.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Before I could stop myself.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	And before I could stop myself, I added,</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Not just him. Everyone else on the football team.
They were all jealous of you, the black guys and the white guys
both.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	I felt the breath leave my chest.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Brian looked from me to Langston, who nodded and
grinned his backwoods grin. &quot;Sure was. Those boys is all jealous
of you, Brian.&quot; He placed his hand on Brian's back. &quot;What
do you say we go pay them all a visit?&quot; </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Brian, getting up off the table
and taking his jeans and jacket from Langston. &quot;I'll show them.
I'll show them what happens when they mess with me.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	When Brian had finished dressing, Langston grinned at
me again. &quot;You can find your own way out, can't you, James?&quot;
he said as he guided Brian through the door, his hand on Brian's back
like a protective father. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	I didn't want to be in that cold room with those dead
bodies under the sheets another instant, so I followed close on
Langston's and Brian's heels as they ascended the stairs, my heart
pounding. I tried to stop myself from heaving my breaths and mostly
failed. Both of them ignored me anyway, but I heard Langston reciting
what sounded like names and addresses to Brian&mdash;probably the
names and addresses of all the football team members that Brian now
believed had killed him and was planning to kill in retaliation. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Just in case, I reached into my pocket and turned on my
digital recorder.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	I left the building close behind Langston and Brian,
with Langston still reciting addresses, and followed them down the
street until Langston had stopped reciting. Langston occasionally
glanced back at me with a condescending little smirk&mdash;or was
that just a trick of the light? </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	It seemed obvious that Langston wanted Brian to think
the football team members had killed him.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	The question was why.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	I stood under a streetlight debating what to do and
watched Langston and Brian walk off into the distance, disappearing
into the darkness.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	I didn't know what Langston was. He seemed human, but
unless this was all some big prank, he had used some kind of
supernatural powers. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	He might be just what he seemed.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	But he might one of those dangerous creatures like
Joseph Austen, or Sophia herself, for that matter, who could kill you
in ways that would vaporize your body so no one would ever know what
had happened to you.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	I decided to go back. Sophia might be willing to tell
me something. If not, I could at least check the Internet and see if
Langston had left any record of himself online. See if anything I
found suggested that he wasn't human.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	I got on a bus, my heart still pounding, and rode back
to Sophia's house.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	My heart didn't stop pounding the whole time.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Langston would have told Brian that the football team
had killed him no matter what I said, so what I'd said probably
didn't matter.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	But I had still said it. I had still appraised
Kenneth's life at several times the value of the football team
members' lives. I had still decreed death for them, so that he could
live. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	I had no right to do that. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	A spastic failure, good for nothing but stacking TVs at
Best Buy, had no right to decide who lived and who died.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	My heart was going to stop pretty soon if it didn't
stop pounding.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	I let myself in and found Sophia sitting at the table
in her pajamas.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;You wear pajamas with little flowers on them?&quot;
I said, looking her over.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;They're gardenias. I think they're nice,&quot;
said Sophia, pushing her glasses up her nose as she turned to face
me. She'd been studying and drinking a mug of something. &quot;Are
you going to tell me where you were?&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I was looking for people for you to kill so you
could reclaim your succubus mivonks despite thinking that gardenia
pajamas are nice,&quot; I said.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	I sat down at the table and grabbed her mug, sniffing
at it. &quot;Is that chicory coffee?&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I think it's nice.&quot; </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Make me some.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Make it yourself.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;If you make it for me, I'll tell you where I
was.&quot;<BR>	&quot;I have a feeling you're going to tell me anyway,
so no.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Remarkably, the beating of my heart had slowed down
almost as soon as I came in and saw Sophia sitting at the table, so
in token of that, I made it myself, and told her what had happened as
I did it. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Her face became more and more grave as I spoke, and by
the end she was looking morose again, as she had earlier after her
conversation with Lucy. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I'm sorry. I...I can't help you. Even if this
Langston person is supernatural, what he's doing isn't high-profile
enough to allow me to get involved.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;So killing eleven people&mdash;or however many
there are on this football team&mdash;is just small peanuts for you,&quot;
I said, starting to get angry. I hadn't actually expected her to go
slice up Langston and pheromone Brian into forgetting his
revenge&mdash;hoped, yeah, but not expected&mdash;but her refusal to
tell me even the simplest things, like how Langston could have
apparently brought someone back from the dead, was maddening. &quot;It's
too small for you to even bother with.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;That's not what I mean. I'd like to help, but--&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Would you really? 'Cause it seems when you'd like
to help, you do it. You get yourself out of bed early to go help old
people clean, but when it comes to the lives of a whole high school
football team, all you can do is brainlessly quote regulations! You
mean you can't even tell me 'Hey, heads up, weird shit coming up
ahead'? Forget this, talking to you is pointless. I'll go find out
whatever I can and try to stop this myself.&quot; I left the room,
ignoring the look of pure misery on Sophia's face, and went upstairs.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	No, I didn't ignore.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	For just one second, I actually reveled in it.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	After all, if it really made her feel so bad, all she
had to do was help me.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Up in the guest room, I took out my computer and did a
search on Tyler Langston.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	I didn't know how common it was for supernatural
creatures to enroll in school, but it looked to me like Langston was
human. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	His resume was on Monster.com.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	He'd graduated from high school in a small town in
Tennessee and had a bachelor's degree in economics from Harvard, and
an MBA from Yale. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	I found some newspaper clippings from a few years ago
that chronicled his later doings. Apparently putting his resume on
Monster.com hadn't done him much good, because he had turned to crime
to pay the bills. About eight years ago he'd been in court on charges
of running a meth ring. He'd allegedly enlisted scores of the
hillbillies, hicks, and rednecks who populated this area to cook meth
in their trailers and sheds, then hooked them up with buyers from the
scores of gang bangers and militias who also populated this area. The
city guys would buy from the country guys, and Langston would take a
cut of the profit as payment for getting the cookers the supplies
they needed and connecting them to buyers. The country guys, most of
whom had been cooking meth for years, liked this setup, because when
they had to sell it themselves, it was pretty common for some of
their erstwhile buddies to show up one night in ski masks, waving
guns around, and take the product for themselves. This way it was
gone as soon as it had been cooked, leaving money in its place. The
city guys, for their part, also liked this setup, because it avoided
the necessity of running cooks in the city, where they were liable to
get busted by the cops, or paying extra money to get somewhere in the
country to cook.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	At least, that was the story. Langston himself had
beaten the rap, though several of his clients hadn't.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	By the way, it's obvious that something is
fundamentally wrong with this country when someone with an MBA from
Yale finds meth running more profitable than working.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	My guess is they laughed him out of the boardroom with
Colonel Sanders impressions when they heard his accent.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Or he just sort of coasted through Yale, partying all
the while.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	There was a knock at the door. &quot;It's your damn
house, come in if you want,&quot; I snapped.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	The door opened slowly, and Sophia appeared, like a
kangaroo rat cautiously edging its way out of a hole. &quot;I want to
apologize again,&quot; she said.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I'm still mad,&quot; I answered, though I wasn't
really.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	Sophia came in and sat down on the bed. She leaned back
and crossed her legs, and I noticed that the neck of her gardenia
pajamas wasn't buttoned all the way up, and she wasn't wearing a bra.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	All I could do was imagine that she had teeth down
there. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	What she actually had was much more terrible, but for
now the teeth image was working for me.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;There are some things I can tell you,&quot; she
said, &quot;and I was going to, but I opened with the wrong thing. I
apologize.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Well, fine. Let's say I forgive you. I've got no
right to be mad at you anyway, under the circumstances.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Have you found out anything about Langston?&quot;
she asked.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	I told her what I found and how it suggested Langston
was human. Sophia agreed. &quot;Some of us have fake histories, but
not usually that extensive. We tend to jump between identities a
lot,&quot; she said. &quot;If I had gone as far as going to court for
drug running, I don't think I'd still be using the same identity. But
it does seem like he has supernatural powers. I don't know if I've
mentioned this, but there are what you'd call necromancers in this
world as well.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;<I>I </I>wouldn't call them that,&quot; I
corrected her. &quot;I'd call them 'freaks'. But go on.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;The usual image of a necromancer is someone who
brings the dead back to life or communicates with spirits from the
other side, but there's no way I know of to bring back someone who's
really and truly dead. So the only way Langston could have brought
Brian back to life is--&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;--if he was never really dead in the first
place,&quot; I finished.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Right. There are toxins that can throw someone
into a coma. Then a necromancer can reawaken him as some other sort
of creature, similar to the way I was turned from a human into a
succubus.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;That's it. This is all about money,&quot; I said.
&quot;Langston needed some new way to make money. But the drug trade
was too risky, especially when he'd barely escaped conviction once
before. He learned necromancy at some point, recently or in the past,
I don't know, and he murdered Brian&mdash;or at least, he pretended
to, and snake venom was probably the perfect way to cover up whatever
he'd used to fake Brian's death, so he pretended to murder Brian with
a snake. Then he went to Brian's parents and offered to resurrect
their son, knowing they'd pay whatever they had to see him again. But
he wanted to get this over and done with as quickly as possible, so
he just asked for ten thousand&mdash;a lot of money, but not
impossible to get on short notice.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;But&mdash;I know I said before that this case
wasn't high-profile enough for me to get involved, but it does seem
that faking Brian's murder by King Cobra attracted lots of
attention,&quot; said Sophia. &quot;Why did he take that risk?&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;To convince Brian that the other members of the
football team murdered him, his death had to be big and violent,&quot;
I said. &quot;It had to be obviously murder&mdash;if he'd used a
spider or a poison mushroom, it might be possible to pass it off as
an accident. This way Brian wakes up knowing he was murdered, ready
to take revenge. Plus, maybe Langston is planning to start an
industry with this sort of thing. Now he can sneak around knocking
off people's kids and then come and tell them, 'I brought Brian
Thompson back to life, you know.' It's like advertising.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Then Langston might be planning to have Brian
'kill' the other members of the football team, then offer their
parents the same deal,&quot; said Sophia. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	I flipped my computer shut and glanced at the time. It
was almost midnight. I took my recorder from my pocket and started
playing the roll of names and houses that Langston had read off
earlier.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;What's that?&quot; Sophia asked.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Langston told these to Brian as they were leaving
the morgue together,&quot; I said. Fortunately, the sound quality was
good. I hadn't gotten the name on the first one, but I'd gotten the
address&mdash;2334 Bueller Lane.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Where is that?&quot; I asked Sophia.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Out in the suburbs. I'll drive you.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;No, stay here. It's better if you can't be even
remotely suspected of interfering when it wasn't warranted, right?
I'm going to try and resolve this on my own.&quot;</FONT></P>
