Writing Stories is Harder Than it Looks. By Nora.
=================================================
Ever since I met Lily, I've had this idea for a story in my head. A few times, when I was bored in class (don't tell Miss Hanover), I tried writing the beginning, but I never got very far. One day, while I was sitting in the clubroom waiting for everyone else to get there, I suddenly felt like writing, so I got out a pencil and paper and began.

Cora was the first to come in. She was just getting over her cold. Today had been her first day back in class since the water war a few days ago. On the advice of Ms. MacCurdy, the school nurse, Cora had worn thick, warm clothes to class instead of her usual shorts: a wool sweater with reindeer on it, sweatpants, and thick socks. She was obviously still not feeling well. Underneath her eyes was written with grey circles, and she had a bleary, half-asleep look. She hadn't bothered to do her hair, and it was floating everywhere in knots and tangles. She stumbled in, looking more dead than alive, and sat down in the chair across from me.

"Hi Cora," I said. "Welcome back."

Cora's face turned red, and she took off her glasses and set them down on the table and stared at them. "Listen, about the garden. You know when I'm talking about, right? Nothing happened there."

"You mean, when you asked me to hug—?" I began, but Cora cut me off.

"Nothing happened there. Got it? I think it's better that way. It's best if we just forget all about it. It was—it was meaningless. It didn't mean anything. There is no 'it'—nothing happened. Right?"

"Well, you asked me to hug you, but otherwise—"

Cora blushed even deeper. "No, no! Nothing happened. We walked back to the dorm, and that's it. Nothing else happened, and I definitely never thought when I was sick in my bed that I wanted—what didn't happen—to happen again. I never thought that." She started to spin her glasses around on the table with her finger. "It's not like I l-like you or anything..." she added. "I never thought it was n-nice...not even for one second."

I'm not very good at figuring out people. Sometimes I'm as thick as Cora's reindeer sweater. But even I wasn't thick enough to get this wrong—it was definitely the opposite of whatever Cora said that was true. Cora *had* thought it was nice, at least for one second, and maybe she even liked me a little now. But she was too embarrassed to admit it, and she didn't want me to tell anyone.

I decided to just keep it to myself, a nice little secret I could feel good about whenever Cora yelled at me or got mad. "Okay," I said. "Nothing happened in the garden. We just walked back to the dormitory."

"Right," said Cora, sounding relieved. 

"You still look pretty sick. Do you want me to do your hair for you?" I asked, getting up to sit next to her, but Cora put her hands on her head and leaned down on the table.

"No...Um, it's fine. Don't worry about it. Maybe you could...make me some tea." Her cheeks were as red as cherries, and her cat ears were twitching back and forth. Cora was cute when she was sick and embarrassed.

I started making tea. By the time I was finished, Lily and Ranta had both come in. I served Cora first, then Lily and Ranta, and then myself, and went back to writing my story.

"You look terrible," Ranta observed.

"You look worse than terrible," said Cora. "Ah, it was nice being sick, not having to see your face every day."
