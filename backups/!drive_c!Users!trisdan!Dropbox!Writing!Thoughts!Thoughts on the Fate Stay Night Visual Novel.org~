* Thoughts on the Fate/Stay Night visual novel, <2014-10-17 Fri>
** <2014-10-17 Fri>
After many years, I finally obtained the Fate/Stay Night visual novel. Illegally, of course; I can't afford $140 to import it, not right now.

It took me almost a week to download, and I half expected it to be another dead end, to find a virus or a broken installer or a broken translation patch when I opened it, but none of that happened; I am actually playing it.

And it's really /looooong/.

I've played for about five hours at this point, and I've only reached the scene just after Shirou summons Saber and Rin comes in to explain what's going on and take him to see Kirei. The anime also took forever to get going, but the VN brings that to a whole new level.

If I weren't already invested in the Fate universe, this would all be unspeakably boring: the super-long prologue, following Rin's activities after she summons Archer and before Shirou joins the War; the even longer three days following Shirou's boring everyday life; the super-long battle scene with Lancer that almost made me want Shirou to die already (not really, but I did want him to summon Saber already). But this early material actually explains a lot of things that weren't clear in the anime.

For one thing, Rin's prologue sets up her relationships with other characters in a way that the first anime didn't, at least if you're already familiar with the basic story. (I understand the new anime, the Unlimited Blade Works one, includes these scenes.) We see how she goes every day to the kyuudo dojo to see someone, and although she's friends with Mitsuzuri, the captain, we know it's not her because they only became friends because Rin was there all the time. Shinji Matou of course thinks it's him, of which notion Rin disabuses him in a not very tender way. It's Sakura, of course. I think. We've seen other early signs of Rin's tenderness towards Sakura too. And unless Shirou's got some kind of weird animal magnetism, Rin's solicitousness towards Shirou (relative to how she treats other people) can only be explained by her knowing that he's important to Sakura. We also see a lot more of how things happened between Rin and Archer on the night she summoned him. Rin and Archer begin by sniping at each other and trying to establish dominance, ending with Rin, in frustration, using a Command Spell to order Archer to obey her. Archer tells her that even though broad commands like that shouldn't really work at all, this one sort of did, which shows that she's an extremely powerful magus and gains his respect. We also see Archer immaculately clean up the room that he smashed on his entrance, and make a nice cup of tea for Rin that meets even her high standards. These things hint at his true identity as Shirou from the future, as does his decision, when he asks for Rin's name (striking her with his solicitiousness), to call her "Rin" instead of "kimi" or "Master" as she expected. 

Rin's hinted bisexuality is also more hinted, even at this early stage. She's very popular among the other girls, just as much so as among the boys, and especially among the meek and timid, such as a girl named Yukika Saegusa, who reminded me a little of Rin's friend Kotone who she rescued from Uryuu in Fate/Zero. (I thought for sure that girl was toast, given the dark tone of Fate/Zero. But I guess Rin had enough childhood traumas, what with her father dying and all.) If we didn't know that Sakura is Rin's sister, we could even interpret her attitude as romantic interest, because her attitude with Sakura (and in general with the meek girls like Saegusa, but especially Sakura) is so different from her attitude towards the boys and the more assertive girls like Mitsuzuri and her other friend Makidera. But the biggest hint is the way she thinks about Saber. At first she just wants to summon Saber because Saber is strong; Rin tells us in her prologue that the Saber has made it to the final battle in all the Holy Grail Wars so far. But at the very end of her prologue, Rin sees Saber...and although she does comment on how strong Saber looks, a lot of her unnecessary comments on how beautiful and majestic Saber is sound pretty similar to Shirou's comments during the same event that we hear later on. Of course, that just makes me like Rin more, since I like yuri (especially sister yuri; unfortunately I don't know of any Rin x Sakura doujinshi. But there are lots of Rin x Saber, and they were always my favorite). 

Sakura is also a more interesting character from the get-go in the visual novel. She's still a sweet, cute, wifely kind of girl, but the visual novel actually explains why she comes to Shirou's house—she came to help him out when he was sick once, and just kept coming—and overall makes her feel more like an important part of Shirou's life and not just an also-ran romantic interest like the ones in harem comedies like Love Hina. She feels a lot more integrated into Shirou's life than in the anime, and her relationship with Taiga is also more fleshed out, which makes their dinner gatherings seem more like a little family and less like pointless backstory. Shirou even admits early on that he's attracted to her, although he thinks she's off-limits since she's Shinji's sister. 

The other thing that makes a lot more sense in the visual novel is Shirou's relationship with Shinji. In the anime, Shinji was a complete asshole, but Shirou just stupidly kept calling Shinji his friend and scampered off gladly to clean the kyuudo dojo when Shinji very snidely asked him. In the visual novel, it's a lot more complicated. Shirou is still way more tolerant of Shinji than anyone should be (and no one else really understands why), but some of his asshole behavior comes from some ugly incidents that happened between them. Shirou knows that Shinji hits Sakura to take out his anger; he found bruises on her and asked her where they came from. Sakura said it was an accident, but Shirou suspected Shinji, and when he asked, Shinji said proudly that he hit her just because she was there. Angry, Shirou hit him back, leading them to become estranged. Shirou was also injured in a work-related accident (I hope he at least got workmen's comp) and got an ugly scar on his right shoulder. Traditionally, one bares the right shoulder when doing kyuudo, but Shinji made a snide remark about the scar, and that, combined with his workload and possibly the fight over Sakura (it's unclear what order these things came in) made Shirou quit the club. Now Shinji constantly hassles Shirou about quitting the club, for some reason. (He claims to be a better archer than everyone else, but seems to think Shirou was closest to being his equal. Given his ego, I'd expect him to be happy that his closest rival was gone. But maybe he just wants to hassle Shirou, and that seems like the best excuse to do it.) The way they relate makes sense in the context of this backstory; Shinji harasses Shirou, and Shirou's reponses are sort of passive-aggressive, in that he maintains the veneer of friendliness while his tone is somewhat sarcastic and hostile. The incident where Shinji asks Shirou to clean up the club makes a lot more sense; Shirou sort of sarcastically mentioned that Shinji wasn't that good at stringing the bows and that he could do it if need be, so Shinji turned the tables and asked him to do it. 
 
The stories seem to split on Day 3. I'm going to try playing Heaven's Feel first. I already saw Fate in the 2006 anime (though I'm sure the visual novel contains a lot of material that wasn't in that version), and I want to see the Unlimited Blade Works anime before I read that route, so I want to start with Heaven's Feel. Plus, of the three main heroines, Sakura is the one who's been covered least in the anime versions; Rin got a decent amount of exposure in the 2006 anime and has the main part in the 2014 anime, even appearing in Fate/Zero in a limited way. Saber, of course, is a major character of both the 2006 anime and Fate/Zero. Even Illya got more development than Sakura in the 2006 anime. (By the way, I'm intensely curious to see why Kiritsugu didn't go back for Illya after the Fourth Holy Grail War. After how things went down, I doubt the Einzbern were very happy with him, but I wouldn't have expected that to stop him.)

It turns out you can't play Heaven's Feel until you beat Unlimited Blade Works. And you miss a day of Unlimited Blade Works unless you first play Fate. So, so much for my plan of playing Heaven's Feel. 

I decided to first play Fate, but it's kind of boring so far because it goes over the same material as the 2006 anime, but with like thousands of extra words of narration and extra dialogue. I like some of this extra material because it develops the relationship between Rin and Sakura much more so than in the 2006 anime. Sakura points out to Shirou that she noticed Rin always being nice to her, which makes Shirou think better of Rin (he admitted to himself that he admired her as a model student and a beautiful girl, but was later shocked when he saw her true personality, even though I don't think her true personality is really that shocking—she's far from perfect, but it kind of makes sense that someone who seems that perfect would have a childlishly competitive side and an impatient side. 

I can't decide if I should just play Fate (God, it's so looooong...) and Unlimited Blade Works (probably ruining any enjoyment I might get from the anime) and then play Heaven's Feel, or if I should do something weird like skip the rest of those two stories and play Heaven's Feel, then backtrack and play Unlimited Blade Works after watching the anime. 

Anyway, it's still just so /loooong/. It's no wonder I played Tsukihime by turning off the sound, turning the text reveal rate to instantaneous, and reading through it really fast. I've forgotten a lot of the major plot points because of that. Plus, it didn't have voices, by Fate/Stay Night has good ones. You can tell they really had a huge jump in production values between the two releases; Fate/Stay Night has much smoother art, and weird effects where the pictures move, and most importantly, it has high-caliber voice talent. Well, Kana Ueda, Ayako Kawasumi, and Mai Kadowaki all are for sure, as well as Jouji Nakata, Hiroshi Kamiya, and Nobutoshi Canna among the guys. I don't know of any other parts played by Noriko Shitaya, Sakura's actress, or by Shirou's voice actor, but given how high-caliber the rest of the cast is, I'm sure they are too, and if they weren't, they are now. It's also interesting that every single character's voice has stayed the same across incarnations; even Kiritsugu has the same voice here that he has in Fate/Zero. The only discrepancy I know of is that in an early episode of the 2006 anime, Tokiomi has like one line in a flashback of Rin's, and his voice actor is different, but that's tiny, and we could even attribute that to Rin's memory being faulty; after all, he didn't seem to have his awesome goatee either. (According to Gen Urobuchi, he spends hours grooming it every day.)
