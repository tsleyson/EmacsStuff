I used to live a peaceful life. A D-student at a third-rate college by day, an amateur journalist by afternoon. Then one night I had the bad luck to see her come out of that bar. She was a good-looking sort of girl, and she had talked to me. She had actively sought me ought to talk to me.

I knew she was up to something.

So I followed her. I followed her and her backwoods-looking buddy, her backwoods-looking buddy who was obviously too old for her. I followed them into the park, hoping to get some dirt on her so I could counter whatever she was planning to do to make a fool out of me.
