* Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai; Split from Unfair First Impressions <2015-05-29 Fri>

** Saturday, March 30th, 2013
If I hadn't read the Ore Imo novels recently, I probably never would have watched this show, because that was where I learned what a chuunibyou is. A chuunibyou is someone obsessed with darkness, dark magic, dark powers, black, demons, and witchcraft, similar to an American goth. Ore Imo's Kuroneko was constantly described as a chuunibyou by Kirino (as well as Iori Fate Setsuna, who also described herself this way). The word comes from the word for second-year middle schooler, I guess because it's pretty common for kids to go through their 'dark' stage at this time. Yugioh is a total chuunibyou show in my opinion; X is another, more mature one. From what I hear, Darker than Black defines chuunibyou anime (makes sense, based on the title). 

Yuuta Togashi (who is totally voiced by Jun Fukuyama; since I've been watching MM recently it was an immediate connection) is just entering high school; he was ostracized at his middle school because he was a chuunibyou and introduced himself on the first day by showing the bandage on his arm and claiming it was there to seal his Dragon of Darkness Flame and he was the Master of the Dark Flame (which he totally stole from Yu Yu Hakusho's Hiei). He chose a high school far away so he could start over and act normal, and the show opens with him throwing out his black coat, all his silver chains and black leather clothes, and his sword that he saved up all his money to buy. While doing this, he notices a girl wearing a black dress with ruffles and an eyepatch climb down a rope past his floor from the apartment above. The next day at school, the same girl comes up to him in class and starts babbling a lot of chuunibyou mumbo-jumbo about her Tyrant's Eye throbbing in his direction, then complains that her eye really does hurt, forcing Yuuta to bring her to the nurse's office for eye drops. She starts calling him Dark Flame Master, throwing him off, and insisting that he unite with her. It turns out that she saw him saying his old catch phrase from middle school when he thought he was alone; Yuuta said it one last time and then 'sealed' it from ever being spoken again, but this girl, Rikka Takanashi, happened to hear him and now afflicts him with her chuunibyou-ness. Yuuta tries to go out with the normal kids, but when Rikka loses her wallet and can't get home, his teacher makes him take her since they live close together. It turns out that she's the little sister of the office lady in the apartment above them, though Rikka claims that her sister works for some evil organization that tries to thwart her at every turn. Rikka ends up eating dinner with Yuuta's family (consisting of himself, his mother, and two younger sisters, the middle school-age Kuzuha and the elementary school-age Yumeha) and Yuuta helps her move in, since her sister works late and isn't around. After Rikka insists that his chuunibyou things are cool and aren't garbage, he brings them back inside, though he says it would be a waste to throw them out and he's going to sell them.

I read on the fansub page where I downloaded this that it's a KyoAni work, and it looks it; in particular, the art style reminds me of K-On. In fact, it almost looks like they stole the appearance of the school from K-On, and the character designs look similarly Hayao Miyazaki-ish; Rikka's mannerisms and expressions also remind me a bit of Yui in the anime. Since the art style was among the best points of the many good points of the K-On anime (even if you hate the story, you've gotta admit that that art style was amazing), I wasn't bothered by this, but it was noteworthy how close the two are.

I liked the story and characters so far; Yuuta was a decent example of the put-upon hero of light novel-derived anime (which I'm pretty sure this is) and his sisters and Rikka were all cute. My favorite scenes were in the nurse's office, when Rikka says she's going to prove that her Tyrant's Eye exists and it turns out that she's wearing an eyepatch over a gold contact lens over a perfectly working eye (she's going to ruin her vision like that), and on the train platform when she uses her roller shoes to "take a hit from an enemy" with a cool pose. I'm not sure where the story is going to go, and that worries me a little; all the good light novel-derived anime I can think of (Haruhi, Bakemonogatari, Ore Imo, Haganai) had either established a strong concept by the end of the first episode, or begun a plotline. This show's failure to do either of those isn't necessarily a danger sign, but it does remind me of Denpa Onna, which failed for me partially because of a weak concept and plot, depending on its heroine to magically create stories for it. There are characters besides Rikka, and since Rikka goes to school and everything, unlike Erio, we could actually have connections among them all that could make this at least more interesting than Denpa Onna even without a strong direction, so I'll wait for more. In the meantime, the first episode was a lot of fun and the art was a joy to look at, just as it was when K-On used it before.

** [More, July 19th, 2013]
I watched Episode 2 of this series, where Rikka's sister Touka is introduced, and wasn't very impressed. I later watched Episodes 3-5 and liked them a lot. It is a very K-On-like series, in that it's mostly pointless and a lot of the jokes shouldn't really be funny but become funny due to the overwhelming cuteness of the characters. In addition to Touka, Episode 2 introduces Kumin Tsuyuri, a second-year who comes to Rikka and Yuuta to see if the stray cat they found is hers. (It isn't.) In Episode 3, Rikka takes a turn for the Haruhi, trying out all the clubs and deciding she doesn't like any of them, then deciding to form her own club. She impresses Yuuta, merges with Kumin's napping club, and calls her friend Sanae Dekomori from the middle school. Shinka Nibutani, a popular girl who Yuuta has had a crush on since the beginning of the series, also joins, though Yuuta can't figure out why. In Episode 4, Nibutani asks to come over, and Yuuta discovers that she's trying to find the Mabinogion, Dekomori's binder, which is actually a printed copy of the blog Nibutani kept back when she herself was a chuunibyou and went under the name "Mori Summer". (Her first name, Shinka, is written with the kanji for "forest", which can also be read as "mori", and the kanji for "summer".) She deleted the blog and is now determined to destroy Dekomori's printed copy, which Dekomori forgot at Yuuta's house. She succeeds, but, as Rikka puts it, Dekomori possesses infinite copies of the Mabinogion, forcing Nibutani to stick around and try to destroy the rest of them as opportunities arise. 

I ended up liking the characters a lot, and several of the jokes were very good. It has that same unassuming feeling as K-On, where you don't expect any kind of cleverness in the humor, and yet it pops up every so often to show that the writers just like low-key, somewhat mellow humor and really aren't lazy hacks. Rikka's persona breaks somewhat in Episode 5, where she's maneuvered by their deceptively friendly homeroom teacher into fighting to pass her math exam in order to keep her club; she talks a little bit like a normal person in this episode, and Yuuta seems to like it. So did I. Dekomori was sort of annoying, especially when she turned out to be some kind of genius, but on the other hand she was a dumbass who hit herself in the face with the balls tied to her twin tails (which she calls "Mjollnir Hammers" and swings around like a pair of bolas), which offset that somewhat. She and Nibutani fight over Nibutani's claim to being Mori Summer, who Dekomori idolizes. Nibutani was sort of a bitch (she had the temerity to call Yuuta a loser when he tried to console her by talking about his own chuunibyou past), but she suffers enough to make it work. Aside from Rikka, Kumin was probably my favorite; in one scene she avoids all of Dekomori's attacks in her sleep, while napping in the center of the magic circle (made of Christmas lights) that Dekomori and Rikka set up on the floor. There's a recurring joke where two characters begin an awesome, earth-shattering battle with giant magical weapons and big explosions, similar to the battles in X, only for us to see that they're really doing something ridiculous, like rolling around on the floor with mops. The animation for these fake battles is surprisingly good and definitely puts X's battles to shame.

Unfortunately, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai ended up on The Anime Network under the terrible title Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions. That title bears no resemblance to the original other than containing the words "love" (koi) and "chuunibyou". It isn't clever. It isn't funny. It doesn't avoid the weird word "chuunibyou", and it doesn't fit the show in the slightest, sounding more like the title of something along the lines of Yume Miru Kusuri or Welcome to the NHK, but with chuunibyou. I don't see what's so bad about the literal translation "Even Chuunibyou Want to Fall in Love" (or "Even though I'm a Chuunibyou, I Still Want to Fall in Love"), which resembles the original and fits the show. It may not be clever or funny and it still doesn't avoid the word "chuunibyou", but it's not clever or funny on account of the original creators, so the translators can't be blamed for that. I detect some of those idiots from ADV at work here. I'd have to say this is even worse than "Heaven's Lost Property", which at least was merely overly literal.

Anyway, I am thinking of getting the rest of the series on fansub to avoid Anime Network. If a DVD set comes out I would buy it.

** [12/3/2014]
Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai and its sequel are now on Crunchyroll, so yay! I watched most of the rest of the series on fansubs, and it turned out that my fears about it turning into another Denpa Onna were unfounded. Chuu2 had something else up its sleeve after all: a love story.

It turns out that Rikka and Touka’s father died a few years ago, and Rikka adopted her chuunibyou personality as a way of dealing with the loss. Touka was hoping that Yuuta would help Rikka snap out of it, but Yuuta, upon discovering that Rikka wasn’t just being ridiculous and had real, serious reasons for being that way, starts to sympathize with her, causing Touka to get angry and consider him a threat. However, he does discuss things with Rikka a little and move her in a different direction.

Nibutani realizes that Rikka is falling in love with Yuuta, so she starts doing things to get them together as everyone works on the school festival together. The show moves in a romantic direction and does a pretty good job of it, from what I remember, although for some reason it’s all a bit blurry.

I’m considering rewatching the first series on fansubs and then watching the second series on Crunchyroll, because it was actually pretty good. I somehow forgot them in between the time I wrote my second set of thoughts above and a little while ago.

** <2015-05-29 Fri>
I bought the DVD set and watched the entire series for the first time, including the Lite episodes and the OVA. 

The beginning of the series was actually a lot better than I remembered, although I feel like it’s been forever since I saw a new really good moe series like this, so I’m somewhat starving for one. (I’ve been on Madoka for a while, which is just dark, dark, dark, even if it’s /good/ dark.) 

I was willing to go a lot easier on Shinka since I knew that later on in the series, she actually does a lot of really nice things for Rikka and Yuuta and even becomes sort of a confidante for Rikka when it comes to her relationship with Yuuta. Towards the very end of the series, there are some yuri undertones between her and Dekomori, which is always welcome.

Dekomori also had an amazing moment in Episode 12. In Episode 10, just before Rikka and Yuuta are supposed to do their guerilla chuunibyou battle performance as Jaou Shingan and the Dark Flame Master, Yuuta, who has been tossing over everything Touka told him about the problems Rikka’s chuunibyou behavior is causing in their family, asks Rikka to take off her eyepatch. Rikka runs off, and Shinka and Dekomori have to take over the performance. During the wrap party of the festival, there’s an open mic performance, at which Rikka takes the stage and sings a song that her father used to love, then takes off her eyepatch.

In Episode 11, Rikka has become normal. She still struggles a little with her speech, but she’s stopped wearing the eyepatch and carrying her Schwarzschild Sechs Prototype Mark II (except as an umbrella when one might be necessary). This is very hard on Dekomori, who confronts them at the train station and tries to engage Rikka in battle, but fails. Dekomori tries again at the society room, showing Rikka a bag of magic rocks and trying to entice her to take them. Rikka instead disbands her society. Dekomori begins screaming and crying and has to be dragged from the room by Shinka, who hugs her and tries to comfort her, causing Dekomori to yell to stop confusing her.

After this, Shinka and Yuuta have a conversation about the true meaning of chuunibyou, and Shinka says she’s somewhat reconsidered her stance and realizes that “normal” people still do stupid and embarrassing things. She sums it up by saying that everyone has problems, and when Yuuta says that’s deep, she ripostes that he’s just shallow. 

At the end of Episode 11, Yuuta discovers that Rikka’s “trip to visit her father’s grave with her mother” (who she had been avoiding, but who she made her peace with and who was going to move in and look after her so Touka could go to Italy) became a “trip to move back home with her grandparents”. At the beginning of Episode 12, he goes to school and enters the society’s room, in which he finds Dekomori.

However, this is not the twin-tailed Mjollnir Hammer Dekomori; this is Sanae Dekomori, cute middle school girl. Dekomori has also done a 180, taken her hair down, and started speaking in a soft voice, calling Yuuta and Rikka “senpai”, and not saying “DESU” anymore. Normal Sanae is mega-cute, so much so that Yuuta experiences a gap in his reality, the pulsing insanity seeping into his brain, inflaming a fever of the psyche, causing him to grab her by the hair and yell at her. Sanae weakly protests, saying that a girl’s hair is everything to her. Yuuta pursues his ceaseless incursion ‘gainst her follicles, his iron grip twisting with inexorable rage into the fibers of her skull, until Makoto comes in and whines that something is wrong with Kumin.

Kumin ran into Rikka on the way home at the end of Episode 11 and has now become the inheritor of Jaou Shingan, Jaou Shingan II, with Rikka’s eyepatch and bandages on. In the face of this awesome power of her reincarnated master, Sanae’s persona breaks and she says “DESU”, becoming Dekomori again and allowing Makoto to discern her true identity. 

Yuuta receives a letter from Dark Flame Master, i.e. his past self. He realizes that chuunibyou isn’t so bad after all (or something, I forget, but it spurs him to ride his bicycle quite a long way so he can be with Rikka again). He meets Kumin on the road; Kumin explains that he made Rikka a chuunibyou. She came to visit the Priestess when she was in middle school, just after her father died, and saw Yuuta. We find out in one of the Lite shorts that Yuuta was escorting his little sister Kuzuha on an errand at this point. He brought along a model sniper rifle and was hiding in the bushes pretending to play a cat-and-mouse game with some enemy (although he comes out to greet a police officer). Kuzuha ran into one of her friends and tried to hide Yuuta from her, but Kuzuha’s friend saw him, and rather than making fun of him, she thought he was awesome and followed him to the store, to which Kuzuha (who narrates the short) says “That was the first time I realized that my brother might be awesome.” Rikka also saw him and thought he was awesome, because he was doing what he wanted instead of just going along with what other people said. 

In a rather cheesy final scene, Yuuta climbs on the roof and takes Rikka’s hand, bringing her down to his bicycle. Her grandparents think he’s a burglar and call the police, but everyone else shows up and confuses the police officer. Shinka pretends Makoto is a pervert who groped her, and Dekomori, who is now Dekomori again and not Sanae, fights the police with her Mjollnir Hammer, which so thoroughly baffles him that Yuuta and Rikka are able to reach the beach and share a nice moment watching the sunrise before the police officer arrives with his patrol car. 

Episode 12 was kind of clumsy and cheesy, but Sanae’s adorablness and Kumin as Jaou Shingan were good enough to cover a lot of it, even though I still thought the final scene was pretty cheesy. The OVA is a lot more lighthearted. Makoto plans a Christmas party so he can try and get closer to Kumin. This ruins Rikka’s plan to spend Christmas alone with Yuuta, although Shinka offers to help her recover some time alone and gives her advice on what to do with that time. The teacher won’t let them have the party at the school, so they have it at Dekomori’s house since she’s rich and has a mansion. Dekomori’s mother (who we never see, but she is reputed to be beautiful) went all out for them, providing a ballroom, lots of great food, and costumes. (She makes Dekomori wear a Christmas gown instead of a chuunibyou outfit, though.) Rikka and Dekomori both get drunk from eating too many pieces of rum cake (seriously? That stuff has, like, two teaspoons of rum per piece, and most of the alcohol evaporates during cooking). Shinka takes Rikka to lay down and apologizes for failing to provide a chance for Rikka and Yuuta to be alone, but Yuuta comes in and says he’ll take Rikka home, and Shinka realizes this is her chance.

As they see off Rikka and Yuuta at the gates, the drunken Dekomori tries to follow them, but Shinka stops her. Dekomori complains that she never gets to have fun with Rikka anymore, and then says even Shinka has been paying less attention to her. Shinka seems surprised, but not totally disgusted.

Yuuta reveals that he had planned to take Rikka on a steamship cruise around the city for Christmas, and there’s still time to do it. They get some nice alone time before they’re interrupted by everyone else. Shinka apologizes that she couldn’t stop Dekomori, and Makoto and Kumin just kind of followed them. There’s a big fiasco in which Rikka almost falls overboard and Yuuta grabs her, but also falls on top of her. The screen goes black and there’s a kissing sound, which I thought was a somewhat cheesy way to sneak in their first kiss, until the screen cleared and we could see that it was actually Shinka and Dekomori who kissed. As Yuuta and Rikka part from the rest, Dekomori accuses Shinka of looking at her with lecherous eyes.

The OVA episode and the show in general were a lot of fun, although I felt the story struggling a little to not be contrived towards the end, and the first episode of the second series (which I watched on Crunchyroll) continued that trend. Although if the sequel can be better than Ore Imo II, that’s not bad, even if it’s not as good as Haganai II. 

I didn’t like Sentai’s translation, though. It felt lazy and awkward in many ways. I asked an Anime and Manga SE question about what the justification was for translating “Jaou Shingan” as “Wicked Lord Shingan” (as Sentai did) instead of, say, “Tyrant’s Eye” (like the fansub). In context, there’s basically no reason to assume that “Shingan” is supposed to be a name instead of an actual eye of some kind (which is what “gan” means). They also didn’t translate Dekomori’s “DESU” at all, in any way, which made it very awkward in Episode 12 when Sanae slips into Dekomori and says “DESU”; they had to translate that as “Yes”, and then it doesn’t make any sense that Makoto figures out who she is from that. I realize there was basically no way to translate this faithfully into English, but they could have at least consistently used “Yes!” (or “DEATH”, which is used in Series II when Dekomori just says “DESU” and nothing else), the way Kenshin Himura says “That it is” in the dub since there’s no way to translate “de gozaru”. And it’s not like this was buried at the end of a 150-episode series; the series is only twelve episodes, but it feels like the translators chose translations when terms first appeared, without any regard to what information might come up later, and then just glossed over it when it became awkward later. (There was also a case where Rikka referred to “My Wicked Lord Shingan”; she kept going back and forth between using “Jaou Shingan” as the name for the eye itself and as the title for the person who had the eye, and here, there was no way to get around that she was referring to the eye itself, so they just glossed over it.)

** <2015-06-11 Thu> On Series II Episodes 1–4
I started watching Series II on Crunchyroll. It was somewhat of a disappointment up until Episode 4, which was still somewhat disappointing, but in a different way.

Series II starts with Rikka losing her apartment because her mother wants to move back to the countryside with Rikka’s grandparents. Rikka is supposed to be finding a new apartment with Yuuta’s help, but she’s secretly living with him since his parents and sisters are in Jakarta with his father. Touka is angry when she discovers this, setting off a massive chuunibyou battle with the entire gang, even Shinka and Kumin. Kuzuha comes home to live with Yuuta while attending school, and Touka decides if Kuzuha is there to keep an eye on them, she’ll permit them to live together.

The series also introduces a new character, Satone Shichimiya, a “devil magical girl” chuunibyou who was Yuuta’s friend in middle school. (She calls him “Yuusha”, which means “hero”.) I have somewhat conflicted feelings about Satone. I don’t mind her overall, but the attempts to make her a “rival” to Rikka or make Rikka jealous of her are kind of trite and lame. Satone moves into Rikka’s old apartment, which seems like a massive and unnecessary coincidence; she goes to a different school, so she starts showing up at the school every so often to engage in battle with the main cast or supply various plot points. 

Dekomori also begins attending high school with everyone else and starts mounting hit and run attacks on Shinka at random moments, often when Shinka is with the theater club. Shinka tears off after her to continue the battle, usually in some ridiculous costume. Episode 4 focuses on their relationship and had lots of good moments (I’m kind of a fan of the Dekomori/Shinka pairing, especially after Episode 12 of Series I and the OVA), but a disappointing conclusion. It concerns Shinka’s attempt to become student council president. Shinka needs to win over the first-years, but she’s afraid of Dekomori’s guerilla attacks ruining her reputation, so she asks Yuuta to keep her occupied while she canvasses the first-year classrooms. Yuuta’s ploy fails, and Dekomori attacks Shinka. But afterwards, the group happens to meet Satone at a restaurant and discover that Satone, who attended two middle schools, was also at Shinka’s middle school and was friends with her during her “Mori Summer” phase. She even has a picture of them together. The picture contains enough of the same details as a faceless picture that Shinka used to have on her blog that Dekomori realizes that Shinka really is Mori Summer, and begins to worship her. 

Shinka manages to get Dekomori to call her “Nibutani-sempai” instead of “Mori Summer-sama” by saying that she has to hide her identity from the masses, but she’s somewhat annoyed by Dekomori coming to her classroom every break to see her. She tries to tell Dekomori this, but Dekomori comes to the edge of tears and Shinka has to back off. When she brings this up to Rikka and Yuuta, Yuuta suggests getting Dekomori to help her with her campaign. Shinka takes this suggestion, and it turns out that Dekomori is extremely helpful, writing excellent speeches, campaigning tirelessly, and painting a campaign poster that catches everyone’s eye. (The pose is somewhat Mori Summer-like, but everyone just interprets that as “wise and serene”.) 

Just before the end of the campaign, Shinka brings Dekomori to her house to finish off the speech. Dekomori made Mori Summer-themed cookies and gives them to Shinka. Shinka realizes that Dekomori is actually talented and very sweet, and as a special reward, she puts on her veil and her jeweled hair clip (which she wears in the same position as her regular hair clip; I guess some things don’t change) and her weird hand thingy and becomes Mori Summer once again. Dekomori takes a picture, which Shinka didn’t want, but Dekomori begs her to allow one picture, and Shinka relents. They hug, and presumably have lesbian sex as a magic ritual to summon the loving spirits of the shaded coppice. (Or not. This is where doujinshi authors come in.)

Of course, this can’t last. Dekomori replaces her endorsement speech with quotes from the Mabinogion and projects the picture she took of Mori Summer onto a giant screen, causing Shinka great pain. Dekomori returns to her belief that Shinka is a fake, encouraged by Rikka, who was jealous when Dekomori blew her off to work on campaign stuff for Shinka (even though Yuuta volunteered to do chuunibyou stuff with her instead). Everything goes back to how it was.

I loved this episode, but I knew from the beginning that it couldn’t last, and it didn’t. What really disappointed me was that there was /no/ change at all, either from Shinka or Dekomori (though some screenshots I found online suggest this might not be the last we hear about this). I wanted some sign that something changed—maybe we could have seen Dekomori with the picture of Shinka as Mori Summer framed by her bedside, or something, to show that she actually still believed Shinka to be Mori Summer. Or perhaps she could have declared to everyone that the true Mori Summer was sealed inside a false personality, like Asuna Kagurazaka was a false personality sealing the Princess of Twilight, and that she was determined to break the seal and release the true Mori Summer. And I would have liked some sign that Shinka, having seen how sweet and helpful Dekomori can be, hasn’t forgotten and doesn’t intend to let things stay as they are, even if it means reverting occasionally to her chuunibyou persona, just as Yuuta has accepted that being with Rikka means he sometimes has to become the Dark Flame Master again. 

It’s rather odd, because Shinka was the one who realized at the end of Series I, before Yuuta did, that it wasn’t so bad to be a chuunibyou and that “normal” people still have problems. Yuuta came around to this way of thinking after the events of Episode 12, but then at the start of Series II, Shinka seemed to have reverted again—she dyed her hair dark, started wearing a long skirt and saying “Gokigen yo” and pretending not to know Dekomori, and declared her intent to be the most normal of the normal. She failed, for various reasons, but that wasn’t the action of someone who’d come to the realizations Shinka did about the nature of chuunibyou at the end of Series I. 

Series II is kind of falling apart the same way Ore Imo did in Series II; the writing is getting sloppy and relying more and more on cliches, coincidences, convenient plot twists, and high concepts. It’s somewhat disappointing; so far I’ve experienced four great light novel-derived pseudo harem series:

  1. Haruhi
  2. Ore Imo
  3. Haganai
  4. Chuu-2

There are more, but those are the ones I’m most familiar with. So far, not one has had a good story on continuation past the initial story arc:

  1. Haruhi used the Pokemon gambit: the relationships never really advance or change. It did buck this with The Disappearance, which, to me, was the absolute pinnacle of the series so far. I still appreciate the series, but I just got tired of it after nothing was as good as The Disappearance. 
  2. Ore Imo...ah, what a mess that was. Unlike Haruhi, it had plenty of material to work with, but the handling of that material was totally screwed up. The Kuroneko plot was good until we got to the ending; the Kirino plot likewise; the Ayase plot was a pathetic afterthought after it had been built up for the entire series up to that point.
  3. Haganai’s writing does suffer from coincidence and high concept a bit later on (Yozora and Hinata being sisters), but overall it does the best. It blows away Haruhi and Ore Imo in one important aspect: the characters and their relationships do in fact advance, change, and grow, in plausible and logical ways (unlike Ore Imo).
  4. Chuu-2 could still pull it in with the rest of Series II, but there are bad signs. Frankly, I consider Yuuta and Rikka’s story pretty much done; I really want to see the other characters get some spotlight (as Rika, Kobato, and Maria did in the later parts of Haganai). I hope we’re not headed for some lame Rikka vs. Satone romantic rivalry. If there is a romantic rivalry in the future, I’d much rather see Shinka vs. Rikka. Yuuta was interested in Shinka early on, so there’s at least a physical attraction; they’re now friends, and they have a lot in common. Shinka thought at the start of Episode 4 that it was somewhat lonely without a boyfriend, and there aren’t really any other candidates. Plus, Shinka’s internal conflict over her friendship with Rikka would make it interesting. But I’d really rather see the story cover Shinka, Dekomori, and Satone (and maybe Kumin) in more depth, with Yuuta and Rikka deemphasized somewhat. 

** <2015-06-14 Sun> Episodes 5, 6, 7

Well, at least it hasn’t gotten any worse. In its next few episodes, Ren continues to have its good moments and its not so good moments. 

Episode 5 concerns the Student Council trying to close down the Far East Magical Napping Society in Summer. Chuu-2 is like K-On in that everyone in the school is extremely nice and very tolerant of the main characters’ weirdnesses, so they aren’t being targeted or anything; it’s just an audit, because of how many clubs there are, to figure out which clubs deserve a clubroom. Rikka of course screws up the meeting and they’re in jeopardy, but are saved when it turns out that there are competitive napping clubs, allowing the group to engage in an exhitibition napping match and make a claim to being a napping club. This was very high concept and implausible, almost Love Hina-level, but at least it was reasonably funny, especially the final scene, where the napping competition is a chuunibyou battle in the world of dreams. (Like The Sandman.) Kumin’s sheep pillow turning into a vicious, gnarled ram was awesome.

Episodes 6 and 7 are about the class trip to Kagoshima. It ends with Rikka and Yuuta almost kissing after she sneaks into his room down a rope with her night vision goggles on, like Sam Fisher in the Splinter Cell video games. Yuuta and Shinka help her get back to her room, and at the very last minute, she kisses him on the cheek. Dekomori, meanwhile, flails around and complains of her boredom. She and Kumin invite themselves over to eat dinner with Kuzuha for some reason.

In Episode 7, Rikka and Yuuta try to spend a day alone together, but they run into Satone, who lost her luggage and has no idea where her hotel is. Yuuta helps her recover the bag from the monkey who’s stolen it, using a maneuver that they once worked out in a similar situation when a stray dog had a bag. Rikka gets offended and runs off. Yuuta sends Satone back to her hotel and goes to look for Rikka, but Satone sends Rikka a text asking her to come to a pier, where she explains that she used to be in love with Yuuta, which made her start to give up her chuunibyou personality, but Yuuta was so into chuunibyou that she was afraid he would stop liking her if she did that, so she determined to never change. 

Meanwhile, Shinka has discovered that someone put up a website similar to her old Mori Summer blog, and her friends think it was her. (She did have a moment in Episode 6 when they were on top of a temple together; Rikka started doing a strange ritual to summon the beings of darkness, and Shinka clasped her hands together in prayer and said in her whispy druid priestess voice that she could feel the Beings of Light, before catching herself.) Shinka thinks Dekomori did it, so she calls Dekomori to complain and make her take it down, but Dekomori had nothing to do with it. (My favorite scene in this episode was when Dekomori gets off the phone with Shinka and rolls over in bed, complaining that Shinka finally returned her call and it was just for that, not to ask how she was doing or anything. Total Deko-Mori service!) Dekomori asks the maintainer of that website some questions about the most complex portions of the Mabinogion, and when she receives a correct answer, begins to believe that this person is the true Mori Summer. This will lead into the next episode, which I hope will be packed with Deko-Mori.

The main plot with Yuuta and Rikka was nice, and Satone developed a little bit. Although I found it implausible that Rikka would overreact so much over Satone and Yuuta’s shared past, the rest of Episodes 6 and 7 were pretty free from the annoying contrived coincidences that marked earlier episodes in Series II. One thing I think the series has done very skillfully is its subtle introduction of Satone. Most shows would have filled up five whole episodes with Satone going “Ni-ha-ha-ha!” and glomping on Yuuta while Rikka seethed and everyone else faded into the background. This show, instead, let Satone’s presence be very organic. The clearest sign of this is during the nap competition episode. Everyone tries to stay up late to be tired for the competition the next day. They play cards and video games, sing karaoke, and eat snacks. Satone just sort of appears there between scenes. She isn’t there at the start, but they just slip her into a scene where we see her playing a game with Yuuta and singing karaoke alongside him. (How they don’t wake up Kuzuha, who seems to go to bed early, I can’t imagine.) In the meantime, even Kumin has gotten an episode, and Deko-Mori has had all kinds of exposure. While I worry that this will mean Satone is under-written when we get to the height of the romantic rivalry between her and Rikka, I still appreciate it. 

Of course, Deko-Mori is still my favorite couple and I want to see more of them. It’s not just because they’re both girls. I just somehow enjoy two people who misunderstand each other due to circumstance and clashing personalities coming to an understanding. It doesn’t have to be romantic or anything to satisfy me (though their kiss in the OVA and their embrace in Episode 4 definitely take it in that direction).  

** Episode 8

This was a full episode of Deko-Mori and was extremely yuriffic, thus my favorite so far. (Actually, I still like Episode 4 a little bit more, but this one was extremely good.)

Dekomori has found a fake Mori Summer online as we saw in Episode 7. The rest of the group spies on her meeting with the fake Mori Summer and notices that she seems to be really creepy; she tells Dekomori to close her eyes and pray, then takes out a camera and snaps a bunch of pictures really fast before Dekomori opens her eyes. (I could never get away with that; my tablet camera makes a giant shutter noise that can’t be turned off.) Shinka is angry and confronts the fake Mori Summer, saying she’ll bring proof tomorrow. There isn’t any proof since she did a much better job than Yuuta of getting rid of the stuff from her past. During their confrontation the next day, when Dekomori insists that Shinka is a fake and the real Mori Summer is here, Shinka says she can be Mori Summer if she wants, and take over Dekomori’s shepherding, and leaves. 

Dekomori is shocked, and clearly depressed the next day, to the point that even her classmates notice. Yuuta tries to get them both to come to the clubroom to talk things out, but fails, so Kumin takes the initiative. Kumin thinks that the fake Mori Summer is amorously interested in Dekomori, from her creepy picture snapping and the look on her face. Shinka says that’s absurd, but Yuuta agrees with Kumin. Kumin says that she thinks deep down, Dekomori wants Shinka to be the real Mori Summer. (And, really, she got the best proof she’s ever going to get—Satone just walked up out of the blue and addressed her as “Mori Summer”, and even had pictures of them together in middle school. She’d have to be an idiot not to realize who’s the real Mori Summer. Even though everyone calls Dekomori an idiot, and she definitely is a giant dork who hits herself with her twin-tail weights, she’s not an idiot.) 

Since there’s no proof left, everyone comes to the conclusion that Shinka has to defeat the fake Mori Summer in a chuunibyou battle to prove who’s the real Mori Summer. (I think it’s hilarious how they keep changing how old Mori Summer is supposed to be—here, Yuuta says 1200 years old, but in an earlier scene it was 300, and before that it was 500, and earlier 3000.) Rikka is going to teach her how to do chuunibyou battle, but somehow loses it, so they call Satone after Rikka thinks about Satone’s statement that she would never stop being the mahou maou shoujo, Sophia Ring SP VII. Satone recounts how Shinka used to drink the sap from trees and other crazy hippy druid stuff, causing Shinka to roll around on the floor in pain. 

The next day, Dekomori is with the fake Mori Summer at the park. The fake Mori Summer pushes her up against a tree and starts nibbling her ear, clearly with lesbian rape in mind. Dekomori cries out for help from “Nise Summer”, and Shinka appears in full garb, with her veil, hand accessory, and harp, saying that she may have lost her memory, but she is, indeed, the magician Mori Summer.

Shinka and the fake Mori Summer have a chuunibyou battle. At the last moment it appears that Shinka has been defeated, but Shinka says she refuses to give up Dekomori, recounting both the bad and the good and calling Dekomori the best idiot. The fake Mori Summer is shocked that she called Dekomori an idiot, but Dekomori is deeply touched by this declaration of love and draws her Mjollnir Hammer, using her ultimate attack to destroy the fake Mori Summer. 

The fake Mori Summer sobs that she’s had a crush on Dekomori ever since she came to the town, her angelic Sanja who has never been touched or kissed by the hand or lips of man. Yuuta casually destroys her fantasies by mentioning that Dekomori had her first kiss, and Dekomori and Shinka both blush and turn away from each other. Fake Mori Summer runs off crying that her fantasy has been smashed. Rikka declares victory, and Yuuta reminds her that she didn’t do anything at all. 

Although this episode got pretty out there, it was awesome because of all the yurrific content and the overt Deko-Mori service. Also, unlike Episode 5, in which the entire world seemed to have gone crazy because there were napping competitions, everything in this episode could pretty much be explained by the mental illness of chuunibyou. 

Dekomori definitely fits into the yuri kouhai mold of yuri shows like Strawberry Panic. Despite being rich and feisty, she has a weirdly submissive personality and is always the servant. Her relationship with Shinka is an interesting combination of the yuri kouhai, like we see in Yuru Yuri with Chinatsu and Yui, and the rivalry yuri, like we see in Yuru Yuri with Sakurako and Himawari. It’s surprisingly sophisticated and shows why Chuu-2 deserves to be in the same league as Haganai and Ore Imo.

Despite Dekomori’s apparent naivete, she’s not an idiot. She’s very emotional and definitely very caught up in the chuunibyou game, but I don’t think it’s because she cares so much about the game itself. In Episode 11 of Series I, it was clear that Dekomori wasn’t so distraught when Rikka stopped being chuunibyou because of how much she loved chuunibyou; it was because she was losing her friend, and she didn’t know how to stop it. Chuunibyou was what connected her and Rikka. In Episode 12, she stopped being chuunibyou because she thought it was a way to get Rikka back. Her relationships with her friends get stuck in certain forms, but it’s the relationship that’s important to her, not the form.

Similarly, Dekomori continued her adversarial relationship with Shinka after Episode 4 because it was a way to keep Shinka around. She thought their relationship could have a different form after Shinka acknowledged her true identity as Mori Summer, but it didn’t work out, so Dekomori reset to the adversarial relationship just to keep things going. It was fairly clear from Episode 8 that Dekomori never really stopped believing that Shinka was Mori Summer. 

Her reasons for going along with the fake Mori Summer are less clear. The fake Mori Summer created that website as a honey pot to lure in Dekomori (some of the CR commenters mentioned that she can be seen stalking Dekomori in previous episodes). Although I don’t think Dekomori knew or believed that lesbian rape was the end goal, she did make a choice to spend time with the fake Mori Summer. Was she really planning to abandon Shinka and go over to someone who would play the chuunibyou game with her? Or did she do it from the beginning to make Shinka jealous, to show Shinka what she was losing or nudge Shinka to be more like Mori Summer? 

I tend to accept the latter. Dekomori obviously knew that Shinka was Mori Summer by this point. She had the most definitive proof she was going to get. And even before this, in the OVA, she was complaining that Shinka wasn’t paying enough attention to her, a complaint that would be repeated in Episode 7 when Shinka called just to yell at her to take down the website. (Not just called, but /called back/; Dekomori called Shinka first. Even though Rikka was the one she was pining for in Episode 6, and even though Rikka probably would have been glad to call back and talk for a minute, she called Shinka.) Already, by this point, and probably ever since Shinka comforted her in Episode 11 of Series I, the one that Dekomori wanted to be with was Shinka Nibutani, not Mori Summer. A fake Mori Summer would be no good, because she wouldn’t be Shinka.

Also, the way Yuuta and Rikka’s relationship progressed was not lost on Dekomori. She commented on their relationship to Kuzuha in Episode 6, and given how close she was to the process, there’s no way she wouldn’t notice. Their relationship turned out the way it did because Yuuta recovered some of the Dark Flame Master. He was even standing in Kagoshima with Rikka, holding up his hand and yelling “Ha!” in a crowded street while passers-by stare. Rikka did also become a little more normal, but it was mainly Yuuta going back to chuunibyou that let them progress. By Episode 7, Dekomori seems tired of her adversarial relationship with Shinka. She probably wants things to be like they were in Episode 4, but that can’t happen easily because Shinka was so angry at her for her (admittedly stupid) decision to read from the Mabinogion at the Student Council elections. But, by analogy to Yuuta and Rikka’s relationship, if she could drag Shinka partway back to chuunibyou, their relationship might be able to progress. She does this, making Shinka have a chuunibyou battle with the fake Mori Summer for her love.
