* Thoughts on Ano Hana, <2014-01-11 Sat>

** Thoughts on Episodes 1 and 2

I kept on hearing how good this series was, and it was available on DVD from Amazon, and I happened to have some money, so due to this confluence of the planets, I bought it.

I was expecting something along the lines of Clannad from what I had seen, and so far my expectation has been borne out, but Clannad has been surprisingly hard to live up to for Key. Little Busters was pretty disappointing for me. It was far from bad, but it was really, really lacking in impact. It had its funny moments, but not nearly enough of them, and it was also pretty devoid of sad moments. The only time I found myself near tears was at the finale of Komari's story. I found that too often, the problems the characters were facing actually had easy solutions or weren't really problems at all.

So far, based on just two episodes, in a total vacuum of knowledge, with no perspective at all, I will say that Ano Hana is what Little Busters should have been. 

I wrote somewhere that I love really interesting and low-key openings. Ano Hana's definitely qualifies, though it's so subtle that when I tried watching the series once on Crunchyroll, it didn't induce me to come back. (I was interrupted while watching and had to turn it off before I had even come to the opening song.) The show begins with the main character, Jinta Yadomi, sitting in his room playing a video game and cursing the flirty teenagers outside as sex-obsessed morons. A girl with grey hair (my favorite, remember?), who refers to herself in the third-person as Menma,  starts bugging him, hanging all over him, pointing at the screen of his shooter and asking which one is Lickachu. Jinta, completely ignoring her, goes to make ramen. Menma bugs him for ramen, but he ignores her, although he does make some for his father, who comes in as he's cooking and asks for it.

Jinta eats with Menma sitting on his lap and complaining the whole time about how unfair it is; he finally gets too "stimulated" or something, and passes out. When he wakes up, she is laying on top of him. Jinta tells us in voiceover narration that she's the manifestation of his stress and the summer heat.

No one can see Menma, and Jinta seems to know why. He wonders why she chose now to appear and why his imagination made her older. We see through flashback that Jinta and Menma used to be part of a group of childhood friends who all had nicknames made by contracting their family and given names, except for Jinta, who was 'Jintan'. Menma says that she thinks she's here because she wants her wish granted. Jinta remembers promising to grant a wish for her, but he can't remember what it was. Menma says she doesn't remember either, but she thinks that everyone needs to be together.

Jinta goes to answer a knock on the door and finds a trendy-looking girl from his school, Naruko Anjo. She came, begrudgingly, to bring his summer homework. Menma also recognizes her, excitedly jumping around and calling her "Anaru" (no, it's not "anal"; it's a contraction of "*An*jo *Naru*ko"). But Naruko carries on a conversation with Jinta like Menma's not there, berating him for being a loser who doesn't come to school. After she leaves, Jinta tells Menma that everyone's different now and getting them all together again isn't possible.

Menma wants to go see Naruko, so Jinta agrees to take her out. He puts on a really horrible beanie and glasses before going out, and we see as he leaves the house that he's a hikikomori; he thinks that the old women out front are talking about him (they might be, it isn't clear), and he doesn't improve his image at all by accidentally talking to Menma.

While out, Jinta runs into two of his other old friends, Yukiatsu and Tsuruko (aliases). Both of them got into the brainy high school and are studying for college entrance exams; Jinta also tried for that school, but he failed the exam and ended up at Midori, the loser school. Yukiatsu and Tsuruko both insult him, although Tsuruko upbraids Yukiatsu for making it sound like he's too fixated on Menma since Yukiatsu is too. As he leaves, Jinta again talks to Menma and makes them think he's crazy. (We find out during this scene that her real name is Honma Meiko, since Tsuruko always calls her by her full name in an annoying, snotty way.)

Menma separates from Jinta on the way home and goes back to her own house. Her younger brother has grown much bigger, she notes, and her father's grey hairs have increased. Her mother is offering curry to her picture at the Buddhist altar. Her brother mocks her for doing this, but Menma's mother says with the way she was, she might not know that she's dead.

Jinta sits around at home being miserable and pondering the past. He was the leader of their little group and was considered the best at all of their activities. He christened them the "Super Peace Busters" and led them on all sorts of adventures, and together they carved that name into the rafter of the abandoned shed which was their clubhouse. One day, Naruko asked him in front of everyone if he liked Menma; Jinta hotly denied this and said "Who would like that ugly—", then stopped, expecting Menma to cry. Menma didn't cry; she just gave a sort of weak smile and then ran out of the clubhouse. Jinta intended to apologize the next day, but he never got the chance.

He decides that might be why she's here now, and goes to look for her. He figures she might be at their clubhouse and goes there. Menma isn't there, but Jinta finds that someone has been living in it and left porn magazines on the table. The one who was living there is Poppo, who returns after a moment and recognizes Jinta. Poppo was another member of the group who had a bald head (a "bozu" cut) and was small and always looked up to Jinta, saying "Wow, you're strong!" He's grown up to be a massive tanned fellow in a Hawaiian shirt and cargo shorts.

Episode 2 begins with Jinta catching up with Poppo, then telling Poppo all about what's been happening to him. Poppo (alias) doesn't go to school; he works parttime and saves money so he can travel all over the world. He has a map with all the places he's been marked, and he just came back from Vietnam, whose girls he compliments very highly.

Poppo tries to help Jinta figure out why Menma came back. (He has no trouble accepting what Jinta says, to Jinta's surprise.) His first guess is that she wants the autograph that Jinta promised her, but Jinta doesn't think she would come back just for that. His next guess is that she wants a rare Nokemon that she never got while they were kids. Jinta thinks that sounds pretty dumb, but he doesn't have any better ideas, so he goes to buy the game.

Meanwhile, Naruko is hanging out with her trendy friends at WcDonalds. Her friends ask her how creepy it was having to go to Jinta's house and say he's probably whacking off to her right now; Naruko weakly defends him, saying it's just that feeling you sometimes get where you don't want to do anything, and her friends agree, although they say they don't want to be associated with Jinta at all. Their noisiness disturbs Tsuruko, studying a few seats over; Tsuruko forgets her notebook in her haste to leave, and on impulse, Naruko follows her to give it back. Menma happens to see both of them as she comes down the street, wondering where she has to go home to.

Tsuruko is loathe to acknowledge Naruko, but she finally does, taking the notebook with a haughty air and telling Naruko she always did try to hard to be like other people; Tsuruko says when they were kids she wanted to be just like Honma Meiko. (Menma had no idea.) Now she's become a trend follower because of that. Naruko is mad that she's getting attitude for trying to do something nice, and Tsuruko says she doesn't want to be seen with anyone from Midori High School and takes off. Menma is puzzled and saddened by this incident, but she goes off to find a home, leaving Naruko to find out that she's running late for her job.

It turns out that Naruko works at the video game store. Jinta has gone there to find the Nokemon game so he can get the rare Nokemon for Menma. Naruko is puzzled that he's buying such an old game and fights with him as she checks him out. Jinta stays up late playing the game and falls asleep; Menma comes in and finds him asleep with the game on.

The next morning, Menma is running around naked in his house. Poppo shows up to eat breakfast with them and tells Jinta that he ran into Yukiatsu and Tsuruko and told them what was going on (we saw this scene a bit earlier). He reminds Jinta that to get the rare Nokemon he wants, you have to trade and battle with someone else, so they go to Naruko's house.

Naruko, reflecting on Tsuruko's words, flashes back to her childhood. She, Jinta, and Menma all sat around playing Nokemon. Menma once stuck a frog sticker on her Gameboy Advance SP, then also stuck one on Naruko's so they would match. Naruko thinks about how she both loved and hated Menma. (My guess is she had a crush on Jinta and thought he liked Menma.) Naruko's mother makes her go water the flowers, and while she's doing so, Jinta, Menma, and Poppo show up. She squirts them with the hose.

After a short discussion in the living room with Naruko's mother, they go up to Naruko's room so she can find Nokemon. (I can't remember if they told her exactly what's happening, but Poppo is a blabbermouth and he tells everyone that Jinta is hallucinating Menma and trying to fulfill her wish, so chances are they did.) Naruko has a vast collection of games and manga, despite her attempts to be trendy, and she has all her games carefully catalogued and filed, so it only takes a minute to find Nokemon Gold. Poppo reads manga while Jinta and Naruko play and Menma looks on. Several hours later, they're finally done, and Naruko jumps up and cheers before getting embarrassed and restraining herself. Jinta says he'll do anything for Naruko in return for this, and Naruko angrily says she doesn't want anything from him, then quietly asks him to come to school again. Menma is happy that they all got together again and had fun, even if getting the rare Nokemon wasn't her wish after all. 

So far I've really enjoyed Ano Hana. The characters are interesting, with more to them than it seems at first. I liked how subtly we were shown that Naruko hasn't become a complete bitch by first seeing her defend Jinta (however weakly), then seeing that she works in the game store, and finally seeing that she's a nerd who loves games and manga and has them all catalogued and filed. Jinta is also interesting; I'm looking forward to getting more of the story on how he failed his exam and became a hikikomori. This is how Little Busters should have been—it should have used the childhood backstory to its advantage, instead of tossing it off to follow stories about unrelated (if cute) girls.

As another point of interest, Ano Hana was played on TV Tokyo's noitaminA block ('Animation' backwards) which had the goal of playing anime that would interest people other than the usual young male otaku. (I almost said 'white' since I see that added to descriptions of American nerds so often.) This block also played Honey and Clover and several other shows that sound interesting (Mononoke). I liked the idea that Clannad-style shows could be considered part of a lineup like that—Clannad isn't inherently targeted at otaku; it's more like it ended up that way by default because of who released it. Clannad could be just as family-friendly as Miyazaki, if it were delivered in the right way. Even though I like the super otaku shows like Ore Imo, the medium can't survive or grow if it only targets one audience; at best it becomes a static, dead medium, releasing a torrent of shows that copy each other without regard to innovation. I think shows like Clannad, Haibane Renmei, Aria, Kino's Journey, and even Monogatari are exploring the boundaries of anime and launching into new territory, and I like it.

[I know, I'm just down on Ore Imo because I'm still smarting over how bad the ending was.]
