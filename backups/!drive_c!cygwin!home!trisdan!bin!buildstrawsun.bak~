# Heavy comments to explain the Bash insanity to future me:

# args[@] "splats" the args into a bunch of quoted strings.
# ${args[@]:1} takes the slice from element 1 on. The end result is to
# pass a bunch of quoted filenames to pandoc; it's sort of like the
# reverse of apply in Clojure. But it has to be in quotes, otherwise
# it somehow does the exact opposite and concatenates the entire slice
# into one big string. And of course they have to be double quotes
# because single quotes don't evaluate anything.

# basedir is defined so that you can run the command from any
# directory; before I had ../stylelink which required that you run the
# command from a directory under the one where stylelink was, which I
# didn't like because it adds hidden context and Bash is insane enough
# without adding hidden context.
