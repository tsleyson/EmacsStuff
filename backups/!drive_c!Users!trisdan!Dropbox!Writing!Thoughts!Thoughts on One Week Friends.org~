* Thoughts on One Week Friends, <2014-09-03 Wed>
** Episode 4, <2014-09-03 Wed>
Shougo and Yuki are an amazingly well written pair of friends. Yuki is totally a shoujo-like hero and kind of an uke; despite being handsome and a really good guy, he also tends to have pretty intense emotions and often succumbs to a feeling of helplessness. But Shougo always gets him back on track before he can go into extreme angst, and this episode, he also helps smooth things over with Kaori. I mentioned before that Yuki and Kaori have an amazing rapport, and this clearly wasn't a coincidence or a one-shot deal, because Shougo and Yuki also have an amazing rapport. Even though I kind of think One Week Friends was a shounen series intended for the moe crowd, the writing so far reminds me of the very best of shoujo in its skill at characters and relationships.

Yuki tried introducing Kaori and Shougo last time, and it didn't turn out that well since Shougo is kind of a jerk. Specifically, he questions her whole story (which is a reasonable thing to do, although he's not aware that a) He's living in a world where disease = drama, so diseases don't have to follow biology as long as they create drama, and b) It's not nice to be so incredibly blunt about it, although it seems he's at least a little bit doing it from worry that Yuki is being conned.) Shougo's kind of a jerk to Yuki, but Yuki seems to be fine with it and just think of it as one of his things. Kaori isn't used to it, and Yuki gets mad at him for the way he acts towards her. Kaori doesn't quite consider him a friend yet, so she retains her memories of him, although she loses all the ones with Yuki.  

This episode starts with some girls asking Kaori out of the blue if she's friends with Shougo. Cornered, Kaori says yes, which makes Yuki jealous since it's still a secret that he and Kaori are friends and he doesn't get to be recognized as the one who defrosted the ice queen. Later, when he and Kaori are on the roof, Kaori starts talking about Shougo and how he's a little scary, but maybe not so bad, and Yuki gets annoyed that she just keeps talking about Shougo (as he puts it; it was like two sentences about Shougo). He asks if she has feelings for Shougo, and Kaori says definitely not, puzzled by his hostility. He tries to recover and says it was just a little boring, but Kaori takes that the wrong way and thinks he's saying she's boring, and also tells him that he doesn't understand at all why she was talking about Shougo. She leaves, telling Yuki she's going home early.

On her way home, Kaori visits the river, where she and Yuki talked about going to see a seal that had accidentally come upriver. Yuki wanted to take her, but Kaori didn't want for their friendship to be revealed yet and suggested taking Shougo, since it's known that she and he are friends and it's also known that Shougo and Yuki usually go home together, thereby transitively creating a natural-looking situation to explain why she and Yuki are together. That suggestion caused part of Yuki's annoyance. While at the river, Kaori drops her diary without noticing. It starts to rain as she goes home, and she accidentally knocks down her poster, so on Monday morning, she doesn't even have her diary or her poster to remind her that Yuki is her friend, making him sad when he tries to apologize and she treats him to a full blast of ice queen. 

Yuki is worried that she purposely threw away her diary because of their fight, but Shougo tells him to listen to what he's saying.  He tells Yuki she probably lost it somewhere and forgot, so Yuki goes off on a quest to find it. Meanwhile, Shougo has a talk with Kaori about Yuki and convinces her that he's not a creep and that the two of them had a relationship. Kaori goes out and finds Yuki at the river looking for her diary. She tells him that she has a vague memory of having lost something important, and although she doesn't remember what it is, it could be the diary. Yuki finds the diary in the grass, and Kaori calls him Hase-kun, to both of their surprises. It's not clear if she remembered him or not; possibly talking with Shougo set off some kind of vague memory. The two become friends again, and Yuki says in voiceover that he thinks that fight made their friendship stronger than ever.

This episode was nice and really sweet and cute, and I was loving the art of the rain and the stormy skies. Even though we can explain Yuki's reactions here without assuming that he likes Kaori romantically, I think he probably does. That's the best explanation for why he approached her in the first place and asked her to be his friend. But because he's a sensitive guy, he knew he had a better chance trying to be friends than making some out-of-the-blue love confession. (It's also possible he himself doesn't really understand his feelings and he just had some vague feeling like wanting to get to know her better.)  Next time, another character is introduced who looks to be Kaori's first female friend. I'm looking forward to that. Not that I dislike the guys (actually, they're really well-written and interesting), but as a moe fan, I think we could use a few more girls in here. But I think the show is really good. It's kind of what I imagine a romance written by Kozue Amano would be like. It's a nice shift back to my usual kind of stuff after watching that Attack on Titan marathon (which is also good, but I can only take so much bleakness and violence and speeches about the future of humanity before wanting something sweet and cute and nice and uplifting, which One Week Friends assuredly is). 
** Episode 5, <2014-09-05 Fri>
 This episode introduces Kaori's first female friend, Saki Yamagishi. Although Yuki is jealous of her, it's not quite as intense as his jealously towards Shougo was, probably because Saki is a girl and because he can see how happy she's making Kaori.

Saki somehow discovered what Kaori is like during her time on the roof with Yuki, so one day when Yuki is late because of a teacher conference over his awful grades, Saki ambushes Kaori and says she wants to be friends, saying that Kaori seems really mature and cool and that she wants Kaori to be her mother, or her big sister, and she's torn between wanting to be like Kaori and wanting to be taken care of by Kaori. Kaori tries lightly to get rid of her, without any real heart, and when Yuki suggests trying to make it work, she tells Saki about the rule that she and Yuki have been following, not to have any contact in class.

Saki's kind of an idiot, though, and she really doesn't get it. She keeps on talking to Kaori in class, following her, ambushing her with hugs, and doing so in front of everyone else, so that Kaori can't get away. Yuki seems to think she's being extremely pushy, but I felt like she just wasn't very smart, didn't understand the rule, and kept forgetting about how she was supposed to act. Being incredibly forgetful is one of Saki's traits; she doesn't remember Yuki's and Shougo's names, even though they're in the same class. When Kaori finally tells Saki about her amnesia, Saki says that makes them alike, since she too is very forgetful. That actually cheers Kaori up, and they decide to start calling each other by first name with "-chan". When they announce that they're going on a "date" together, Yuki is jealous/worried/possessive and follows them to snoop, roping Shougo into it. Kaori and Saki eat crepes at the place that was closed when Kaori and Yuki went, share bites, go shopping for animal-themed pajamas (Yuki loves Kaori in her bunny pajamas), and hang out to talk by the river. At that time, Shougo tells Yuki that Saki was in his elementary school class, and was extremely forgetful, dopey, and shy, so she was bullied; he's surprised that she became so well-liked in high school, despite all this. Saki simultaneously tells Kaori the same story to encourage her to try and open up more in class. Kaori writes all about the day in her diary so she won't forget.

The next Monday, Kaori comes to class and cruelly ignores Saki's greeting. Saki is puzzled at first, but she doesn't give up and, finally remembering what Kaori told her, expresses amazement that Saki really did forget. Saki introduces herself and reminds Kaori of what happened last week, and Kaori remembers (or more likely, read in her diary) that they shared crepes. Saki's friends are amazed that Saki did something so amazing, and tell Kaori how much they love her even though she's a ditz and forgets everything. Kaori finally smiles in class, and Saki tells everyone what a cute smile she has, lowering the tension between Kaori and the others; in the final scene, Kaori looks over her shoulder at Yuki and smiles, and Shougo comments that Kaori recognized him, signalling that her amnesia might be lightening up.

Saki was a great character. Just like Yuki and Shougo are perfectly paired up, Saki and Kaori are also perfectly paired up. Saki succeeded in breaking down Kaori's ice queen façade because she's too dumb to stick to the rules, unlike Yuki, and also so guileless and apparently pure that Kaori couldn't bear to shoot her down, even though we saw her shoot down Yuki at the very beginning of this episode (and later apologize to him on the roof). Saki is also really cute and fun to watch. She would be the crazy character in a yon-koma, but I like how even though her personality is more over-the-top than the other main characters, the writers succeeded at making her a calm over-the-top character who fits in with the calm and peaceful pace of this series. Somebody on Crunchyroll thought she was going to be a "rival" for Kaori, which I always found doubtful—this isn't a "rival" kind of series—but that statement was absolutely wrong, because Saki is someone who understands Kaori even more than Yuki does.

Yuki is the only notably unique character, but Kaori, Saki, and Shougo all feel like the ultimate implementations of an idea we've seen before—although the basic traits have appeared in other shows (e.g. Kaori is a bit like Nagisa Furukawa with a dash of Tomoyo Sakagami; Saki is sort of like Yui Hirasawa; and Shougo reminds me of Akutagawa from Bungaku Shoujo), the way the traits are realized, and the skill with which they're used to build relationships between characters and advance the story, is uncommonly good and unique.

Still loving the art. I like the unique character design too, with Kaori's drooping eyes and slow, sweet smile, and Saki having similar (but not quite so droopy) drooping eyes and a sweet, pure grin. I like the songs too, although they took a minute to grow on me. Very peaceful, a bit more anime-like than the Aria music.
** Episodes 6 and 7, <2014-09-14 Sun>
In Episode 6, Yuki fails his math test and asks Kaori for help studying for a makeup exam. Saki also failed, so she too asks Kaori for help, and Shougo ends up getting involved too. They go to Kaori's house to study and meet her mother, who greets them very warmly. Saki ends up being a hindrance to the studying. Kaori admits that she finds Shougo somewhat scary, but says she'd like to be friends someday; Saki gets her to say that they're friends already, and the distance between them closes slightly.

Kaori's mother passes Yuki a note asking him to meet her at the park after school the next day. She mildly flirts with him, saying if anyone saw them, they might think she was having an affair, then tells Yuki that she doesn't know exactly how Kaori's amnesia works, but she does know when it started. It was in sixth grade. Before that, Kaori always had lots of friends, but one day she went out, apparently to have an unpleasant encounter with someone. On her way back, she was hit by a car, and when she woke up she'd forgotten all her friends. There's no brain damage, so it's something psychological. Kaori's mother thanks Yuki for being Kaori's friend, even though it's a lot of work.

Back in class, Saki's friends start talking to Kaori casually, and she ends up getting involved with the rest of the class. Yuki asks her if they can now talk openly, and Kaori says of course.

In Episode 7, Kaori is becoming more and more integrated into the class. She no longer acts like an ice queen, and she's becoming friendly with Saki's friends too. They both think Saki is adorable even though she constantly forgets things, which emboldens Kaori to accept their offer of friendship and let them call her 'Kaori-chan'. (I can only remember the name of one—Maiko, the crazy one who hugs Saki all the time.) They question Kaori about her relationship with Yuki, asking about its nature and how it began and so on. Everything Kaori says makes them go "Kyaa!", and when Kaori says she and Yuki are dear friends and that Yuki approached her by asking to be her friend, they say Kaori and Yuki are very pure. When Kaori describes Yuki's personality, Saki's friends say he seems like a really nice guy, but Maiko prefers Shougo. Saki, as usual, can't remember who Shougo is.

Yuki is happy for her, but a little sad that their alone time is decreasing. He asks Kaori to help him study for finals, asking that she not invite Saki so they can be alone together. While they're studying, Yuki starts complimenting Kaori, saying she's smart, friendly, and cute. He gets intensely embarrassed and tries to say he meant that objectively; Kaori is happy because a boy has never called her "cute" before. Their nice moment is interrupted by Saki, who was asked to hang a huge poster by the teacher. She can't do it because she's short (the poster is taller than she is), so Yuki does it for her. Saki's friends come in to get her for a study session at the library and comment on how helpful Yuki is. (Kaori and Yuki also talk about how Kaori likes math. Yuki asks if she has a favorite number, and she says she likes 1. An interesting choice—the multiplicative identity, and one of the "five most important numbers of mathematics" in Euler's Formula, e^iπ - 1 = 0.)

Yuki is worried because he and Kaori won't see each other over summer vacation. Thanks to Shougo, he manages to talk to Kaori and ask if they can see each other over the break (he gets really nervous when she talks about the great trips her father takes her on during summer breaks). On July 28th, they meet each other on the roof of the school. Kaori says she knew Yuki would come looking for her there, and Yuki realizes it's Monday and asks how she knew that. Kaori says she read her diary, but as she was reading it she realized that she knew who Yuki was. She remembered him. Yuki is overjoyed.

After the ending credits, we backtrack to July 14th, which is Yuki's birthday. Kaori gives him a bag of cookies that she made herself. Shougo dropped the hint that the 14th was Yuki's birthday, so Kaori wrote it in her diary to remember. Yuki is extremely happy. He accidentally asks Kaori how she feels about him, and she says she likes him, which shocks Yuki at first, but then he asks if she likes Shougo and Saki, and she says yes, and if she likes math, and she says yes.

Both of these episodes were super-cute. I can see it moving towards the Kaori/Yuki romance, which is okay. They've done a good job setting it up. We saw again what a good match Shougo and Yuki are as friends, story-wise. It was funny when Shougo got on Yuki's case for not broaching the subject of summer vacation with Kaori and Yuki claimed to be a "man of action"; he's actually totally Hamlet-like in his inaction, and never does anything until Shougo makes him. Shougo even calls him a wimp in Episode 7 because he's angsting so much over how he's going to keep Kaori from forgetting him over summer break. If the general atmosphere of the show weren't so light, sweet, and cute, it could get really annoying, but since it's a zero-melodrama show, it rather comes off as endearing. In a lot of shoujo series the heroine is torn between the nice guy and the dark loner jerk/crazy guy (which would be Shougo here); for example in Honey and Clover we had Takemoto and Morita, and all of Yuu Watase's series seem to have this. Usually it's not the nice guy who wins. Yuki is just like the nice guy in those shoujo series, except here the dark loner guy is on his side instead of being his rival, so he gets the advantage of early action, and gets the girl for once. (Saki's friends, of course, prefer Shougo, like the heroines in those shoujo series usually do.)
