* Thoughts on Hanayamata <2014-10-30 Thu>
** Episode 1
I can't remember now where I heard of this, but it was on some tangential page, I think maybe TV Tropes, talking about English in anime. I read a few chapters of the manga, but the scanlation has stalled, and then I saw that it's on Crunchyroll, so I decided to watch it sometime in the future. Now that I've finally cleared out my ready queue by finishing Fate/Zero, Is the Order a Rabbit?, and One-Week Friends, I've decided to watch this while waiting for new episodes of Unlimited Blade Works. 

It wasn't totally clear from the early manga chapters, but the anime makes it pretty clear that this is a moe show about five middle school girls in a club—a club dedicated to yosakoi, a type of traditional Japanese dance that seems to be rather flashy and energetic. The main character is Sekiya Naru, a cute and shy fourteen-year-old girl who loves fairy tales and thinks of herself as unimportant and boring. She admires her friend Yaya, who apparently writes and plays music, for having a dream, and fantasizes about someone coming and taking her away like in fairy tales. 

Apparently her father is some kind of kendo instructor, because we see Naru practicing iaido (drawing the sword) when her father comes in and orders her to deliver something to a nearby mansion where an acquaintance of Naru's, who she calls “Tami-oneechan”, lives. On her way home, Naru sees a mysterious blonde girl dancing on top of a torii and follows her, thinking that she looks like a fairy and asking the girl to take her away. The blonde girl grabs Naru and spins her around, but Naru chickens out and lets go of her hand. Before she leaves, the blonde girl says she'll take Naru away, and Naru ends up with some kind of weird clacker thing that the blonde girl was holding.

Yaya also has a run-in with the blonde girl, who jumps down from a high hill and lands on her, running away without a word of apology.

The next day, the blonde girl appears as a new transfer student at their school. Her name is Hana N. Fountainstand, and she's from America. When she sees Naru, she runs to Naru's sad, takes her hands, and asks her to do yosakoi with her. Naru shakes her off, and later looks up yosakoi on “Zooglu”. Finding that it's a traditional team dance where everyone wears brightly colored kimono, Naru is terrified and says she could never do such a thing. However, Hana comes after her the next day, begging her to do yosakoi and chasing her around the school while Naru imagines being taken away by her as being akin to being abducted by aliens. Yaya suggests that Naru join a club to get away from her; they look out the window and see Hana staring in at them with her face pressed against the glass, even though they're on the third or fourth floor. 

Later, while Naru is in the library reading, Hana suddenly appears under her table and freaks her out, making her fall backwards. Naru finally tells Hana that she seriously doesn't want to do yosakoi, and Hana apologizes for coming on so strong and says she was just delighted that someone wanted to dance with her. Yaya and Naru notice that Hana has started standing in front of the school with a sign and accosting people. She also puts up a sign saying she'll be on the roof after school waiting for people to come dance with her.

Naru goes just to give her the clacker back, but Hana tells her to keep it as a memento of their meeting. Naru asks Hana why she keeps going when no one is interested, and Hana tells Naru about how she saw yosakoi dancers when she came to Japan as a young girl, and how she was fascinated with them. Naru remembers how she was fascinated with the movie she watched when she was younger (which appears to be /Cinderella/) that got her into fairy tales. She cries out that Hana doesn't realize that some people are empty and haven't got any dreams or ambitions like she does, and Hana says if you're empty, that just means there's lots of room to fill up with memories and happiness. In tears, Naru agrees to help Hana out with recruiting, although she says she can't dance. Hana ignores her and acts like she's going to be dancing.

I liked the manga a lot when I read it, and the anime, I think, improves on it by introducing some of the characters sooner, especially Tami, and moving the plot along faster than the manga. Naru is an adorable lead heroine, and the way she and Hana get on is a lot of fun. Naru and Yaya's relationship is really cute too. The character designs are a little bit unique, especially Hana, who looks like a wild fox. She has two fangs, and you can see both of them quite a bit, which increases her vulpine appearance (otherwise she'd look like a vampire). I know from the manga that Hana has a background in urban free running, which is why she can scale rooftops and dance on torii like that; it's interesting that they actually tried to explain it instead of just relying on us being familiar with the archetype. The groundwork has also been laid for some interesting and cute relationships as the show goes on. I'm curious to know what's up between Naru and her father, and why he seems to be so strict, and why she practices iaido (a sword is the last thing you'd expect to see Naru waving around). The art and animation are also quite nice, with lots of color and themes that resemble the kimono that yosakoi participants wear. The dancing in the opening sequence is amazingly well animated.
** Episode 2 and 3 <2014-10-31 Fri>
Yaya is jealous of Hana and Naru's relationship. She feels like Naru is spending all her time with Hana and can't figure out why. She's particularly surprised when Hana asks if she can come over to Naru's house for a strategy meeting and Naru says yes, since Yaya had already mentally answered no on Naru's behalf.

Naru makes sure to hide anything potentially embarrassing before Hana arrives, but she somehow forgets to hide her illustrated poem about the night she met Hana. They discuss how to recruit new members. Hana sees Naru's books and asks if she likes to read; Naru says yes and asks if Hana likes to read, and Hana admits that she likes superhero comics and she did free running because she wanted to be a ninja. Hana tells Naru this is how she got into yosakoi; she liked superheroes, but they're always lonely, and Hana wanted to do something with other people. In yosakoi, the dance is synchronized and you do it with a group of other people, so it felt more fun to Hana. She shows Naru a DVD of a big yosakoi performance and gives Naru one of the yosakoi clackers, called a naruko, which Hana says is destiny.

The next day, Hana asks Naru to go to a yosakoi shop with her. Yaya expects her to say no, but Naru says yes. However, Naru is scared of the yakuza-looking guy at the front door and runs away, taking Hana out for traditional Japanese sweets instead. Yaya is distracted and can't concentrate on band practice; she sends Naru a text asking if the yosakoi shop was creepy, and then stares longingly at her phone the whole walk home. In the evening, she finally gets Naru's reply and is not happy at all that they went out for anmitsu together. The next day, Yaya confronts Hana and Naru outside school and yells that Naru can't be serious about this yosakoi thing and that she's always been a wimp who couldn't get up in front of people. Naru becomes determined to win her approval and starts practicing hard.

Yaya thinks that Naru was always the quiet girl in the corner and she and Naru became friends only because they walked home the same way, but that Naru always listened to her boasting and whining and told her how cool she was or how it wasn't her fault. Yaya decided she wanted to protect Naru too, and realizes she might have been jealous. Hana comes and grabs Yaya and brings her to the roof to see all the effort Naru is putting in. Naru is pretty terrible and falls a lot, but Yaya is touched by her wish to make up. Hana and Naru give an impromptu performance, and even though Naru falls down, Yaya claps and apologizes for the other day. Hana comments that this is that tsundere thing they talk about.

In Episode 3, Naru and Hana go into the yosakoi shop and discover that the proprietor, despite his yakuza looks, was actually afraid of them because he thought they were juvenile delinquents who were going to vandalize the shop. He's delighted that young girls and foreigners are interested in yosakoi, so he's happy even though Hana bluntly tells him they're just window-shopping. He teaches them a more efficient way to swing the naruko and tells them about how the yosakoi teams design their own costumes; it turns out Naru is interested in this, so he gives her a pamphlet and tells them about a yosakoi contest that's coming soon. Hana wants to enter, but to even be recognized as a school club, they need at least four members. Hana and Naru pass out flyers, but the Student Council President stops them, saying they can't recruit since they're not an official club. Hana goes back to accosting people and giving performances in the halls, while Naru hides and watches with Yaya, since she doesn't have the nerve to participate. They also ask their homeroom teacher, Sally-chan-sensei, to be their club advisor. She doesn't want to since all the girls have been coming to her for advice and she really just wants to float through the year since she's only a maternity leave substitute, but Hana slips the form into her back pocket.

Over the long weekend, Naru and Hana practice yosakoi at the shrine, where Tami sees them and comments on how beautiful their dance is. Hana hails her as a Japanese yamato nadeshiko (she also hailed Naru's father as a Japanese samurai, and the shop proprietor as a Japanese gangster, saying “Japanese” in English). Yaya has to work at her family's soba house. She happens to find Hana collapsed outside the door and feeds her. Hana was wandering around town in a kimono, but she fell into holes and got chased by a dog, so she's tired out and needs food. Yaya thinks how clingy and annoying she is and how she doesn't know what Naru sees in her, especially after she gives Hana back the coat Hana lost when she fall on Yaya and finds out that Hana didn't even realize Yaya was the one she fell on. Yaya and Naru are supposed to meet and see an anime movie, so Hana invites herself along. She and Yaya end up going out in town to the bookstore and walking around the mall eating food samples. Yaya doesn't want to go out with a blonde girl in traditional Japanese clothing, so she dresses Hana up in her younger brother's clothes and mocks Hana for being short, which bothers Hana. Hana asks why there are English words in Japanese music, and when Yaya comments on her big eating, Hana says Japanese portions are so small that she has to eat a lot of them. Yaya asks straight out why Naru likes Hana, since she's clingy and annoying. Hana says Naru told her she wants to be dazzling, and Yaya thinks that Naru did always want to do something amazing. They get to talking about life, and Hana says she only wants to do things that are fun since everyone has a limited amount of time, and Yaya recalls herself saying something similar to Naru about her music in the first episode and thinks that she understands a little what Naru sees in her. She then glances at the clock and realizes she stood Naru up.

The next day, Naru is very angry and won't accept Yaya's apology, especially when she sees how close Yaya and Hana seem to have gotten. They go to the roof to practice and find the Student Council President there with Tami, telling them they can't use the roof for unauthorized purposes.

These two episodes were really adorable. Yaya's jealousy of Hana was especially cute, and it was a fun way to get a tsundere into an all-girls cast without copying Azu-nyan. Yaya is a subtle tsundere, though, and her deredere with Naru looks similar to a genki girl's, like Hana's, so she's kind of a mixture of traits. The scene where Naru obsessively hides everything embarrassing in her room and erases her browser history was pretty adorable too. Hana is a fun character as well, and her questions and comments about Japanese culture (like about the music) actually seem like things a real American would ask. Also, it doesn't feel like we're being asked to accept that she's pushy or outgoing or blunt because she's American; it seems like that's just part of her character.

In a lot of moe shows it feels like the writer created the characters beforehand, independently, and then later thought about their relationships and how they would interact. It doesn't invariably turn out badly (K-On, for example, feels this way but also does a good job with the relationships and interactions), but sometimes it can lead to problems (Gochiusa, a little bit, and Lucky Star sometimes). Hanayamata feels like it was written with the character interactions and relationships in mind from the start, more like a shoujo series (which Crunchyroll has it down as, along with slice-of-life and comedy). The way the “love triangle” between Naru, Hana, and Yaya developed felt organic and believable, not at all contrived as it might have, and I liked the yuri aspects of it. (I'm always down for some yuri aspects.)  

The opening really grew on me in just two episodes. (Actually, I can only surmise that it was always fun and adorable and extremely well-animated, and I somehow just didn't see it yesterday.) The voice acting is really good too. The cast is almost entirely unknown, in that there was no one I'd ever heard of in it and none of the actors have a Wikipedia page. Some of them might have Japanese Wikipedia pages, though. I particularly like Naru's actress; her voice is high-pitched, but soft and kind of creaky. Everything she says is like a little squeak that she just barely has the power to give voice to. It's adorable and totally fits Naru. Hana's actress reminds me of Kanae Ito. 
** Episodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 <2014-11-02 Sun>
A lot happened in these five episodes (I guess if not a lot happened in five episodes, there's probably something wrong with the pacing, though). 

Tami manages to get Machi, the Student Council President, to relent and let Hana and Naru use the roof until they can find four members and secure official status as a club. Hana tries to convince Tami to join the club, and Tami is somewhat interested at first, but it turns out that Tami has an Electra complex and strongly desires her father's approval. (Well, Machi calls it a father complex. Tami definitely thinks he's wonderful and really wants him to love her and approve of her, but I don't know if I'd call it any more than the desire for love and approval of a daughter of a cold and demanding man.) When she brings it up, her father says after all these lesson she's taken on (piano, English, flower arrangement, and others), he'd be less than impressed if she threw them all away to do yosakoi with her friends. Tami also seems interested in doing normal things with her friends, and longingly watches girls running off to eat sweets together after school. She tells Hana and Naru that she can't do it.

One night, Tami delivers a return gift to Naru's house for what Naru delivered in the first episode, and Naru insists on walking her home so they can catch up, since Tami says she can't stay and has to get back to her piano lesson. While they're walking, Naru tells Tami that Tami was always her shining princess whose existence she aspired to, and Tami says she always loved having Naru with her, following her around. Naru says she joined Hana's yosakoi club because she wanted to be a dazzling person just like Tami and Yaya.

Tami struggles with it, but she finally decides that she doesn't want to do all these lessons anymore and she really wants to do yosakoi. Hana and Naru are delighted to have a third member.

In Episode 5, they pressure Yaya into putting her name down for the club, even if she's only a member on paper. (Naru uses her "kawaii attack", a terrifying ability that can persuade anyone to do anything, like the "push" in /Firestarter/. At least, if that person is Yaya. Apparently it also works on Sally-chan-sensei, because together with Tami, they get her to become their advisor even though she doesn't want to.) They bring Tami and Yaya to the yosakoi shop to meet the owner, Masaru. (Hana calls him "Aniki" due to his yakuza-like appearance, and he calls her "Hanacchi". So she's using a yakuza name for him, and he's using a teenage girl name for her. He also uses -cchi for the other girls.) They end up buying naruko for Tami and Yaya and beginning to plan for the contest. With Sally-chan-sensei along, they attend a parade where a big yosakoi group is doing a performance. They meet Masaru there, who points out another group of young girls doing yosakoi and says he supported them, and they were able to progress from just a few members to a big group doing a significant performance. (So that's why he's so in touch with the pulse of teenage girls.)

In Episode 6, Tami suggests that they enter a smaller neighborhood performance contest and get experience so they don't have stage fright when they get to the big contest, after Yaya mentions that her band could barely play during their first performance. Sally-sensei doesn't want to do anything, so she denies them, but after Hana begs, she says if they all average at least 80 on their exams, they can go. Yaya points out that Naru and Hana will have problems, because Naru is terrible at math and science, and Hana is awful at classical literature (because of all the crazy old Japanese) and social studies (? I guess maybe because that sort of thing is somewhat culturally varied, and Hana is American, so she doesn't quite understand the mindset underlying the Japanese social studies curriculum). Yaya tutors Hana, but she ends up being the only one who doesn't pass. Meanwhile, Yaya also has an audition with her band to enter a big show.

Hana beseeches Sally-sensei to let them go even though she didn't fulfill the condition. Sally decides to be a hardass about it, because she's lazy and would rather not do anything.  
Tami made music for the performance already, and one day after class, some girls ask what yosakoi is, and Hana decides to do an impromptu performance. Sally-sensei happens to come in while that's going on and tells Hana afterwards that she was too hard on her and she's going to let them do the show. However, Yaya receives a text from her band, who show her that they didn't pass their audition, and tell her they want to stop doing the band. 

In Episode 7, Naru designs a nice logo for their club with a different flower representing each member (she herself is a sakura petal which recently got its color). Sally-sensei gives them cosplay animal ears and tails, but they don't want to wear them, so Tami gets permission from Machi to go through some old things that another club left behind, and they find haori jackets to wear over their uniforms. Yaya starts to hold herself at arms' length from the yosakoi club, even her best friend Naru. She tells them she won't do the performance with them and won't accept her costume. Hana thinks it's because of what happened with her band; Yaya wouldn't tell them, but they spoke with another member, who told them they decided to break up because some of the members are going to different schools and some of them have boyfriends they want to spend more time with (by the way, when exactly did Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan spend any time with their boyfriends? It's no wonder Karen-chan was on the rocks with her boyfriend. Although secretly being in love with your brother is also no good for a relationship). Hana and Naru tell Yaya not to worry, because they love her and they'll support her, but Yaya says that's not it. She gets angry and yells at Naru that she hates her and wants to be left alone.

Yaya pretty much immediately regrets this and tries to send Naru an apology text while she's in the bath, but doesn't. She spends a few days refusing to talk to anyone. Naru and Hana together formulate a plan to bring her back. They stand on the roof and yell insults at her as she approaches the school one morning. Yaya gets angry that they're embarrassing her and runs to the roof to strangle them. She admits that her real problem was that she was lonely and felt like she was a failure in Naru's eyes since her band had fallen apart and she'd lost the thing that Naru always admired her for. Naru says she loves her anyway, and Yaya agrees to put her efforts into the yosakoi club. Tami, who didn't come up to the roof because she felt something intense was going on, smiles as she stands outside.

In Episode 8, the performance approaches. The girls do their performance for Sally-sensei, who says their middle school charm and Tami's and Naru's soft thighs will get those old men to cheer for them. (They really do have nice thighs. Machi agrees too; she pinches Tami's thigh when Tami tells her what happened, and says it's nice.) Tami and Naru get a complex because they think having soft thighs makes them fat, so Hana starts putting them through training, while Yaya redoes their music, using the synthesizer and her drums, since Tami's piano sounds very classical and everyone agrees that it could use more of a modern pop sound. 

The girls find out the venue is sort of a cheesy neighborhood show with clowns and magic, which is somewhat disappointing but also somewhat comforting. However, they show up without their music CD and determine that it was all Sally-sensei's fault. Sally-sensei calls her sister, Machi, to bring the CD for them. She pressures Machi into going backstage to deliver it and then staying to watch, even though Machi already turned down Tami's invitation because she's busy studying. Hana and Naru are scared, but Tami is glad that Machi came to see them. Yaya comments that she imagined Sally-sensei's sister being very different and imagines someone who looks like Yui Hirasawa curled up under a futon.

The peformance starts off pretty well, but Naru, haunted by bad dreams about a time when she was in a school performance and fell over, looking like a total idiot, misses a step and gets everything out of time, then stumbles and falls to her knees. The episode ends on this shocking note.

This was an excellent run of episodes. Episode 7 was probably the best one so far, especially the scene where Yaya says she hates Naru. That scene was especially sad, but adorable, and it was cute how Yaya seems like someone who has everything together, but then falls apart in this episode to the point where she says something like that to her best friend. I also thought it was cute in Episode 4 when, every time Naru said something about Tami being her beautiful princess, Yaya would go "Aren't I also beautiful and wonderful like a fairy tale princess?". (Finally Naru says no, she's not a princess; she's more like a prince. Yaya's emotions on hearing this seem to be very complex.) 

Hana somewhat takes a backseat in these episodes, which I think is the right call. She's an important character, but I'm glad the writers set her aside for a minute to focus on other characters, especially Tami. Tami's an okay, but not great, character, but it's all conception and nothing about the execution. That is, her conception as a beautiful, refined, yamato nadeshiko makes her somewhat boring, but given that constraint, she's still well-written. I think Machi joining will salvage that, too, because Tami definitely has some kind of yuri thing going with Machi, and it's not at all one-sided. In fact, if it is one-sided, it would be all on Machi's side. But it seems to be not one-sided. Tami loves hugging and glomping Machi, and even if she's just doing it like Hana does to everyone, Machi doesn't seem to see it that way. She rubs Tami's thighs and blushes with delight when Tami hugs her, and when Sally-sensei brings up that Tami wants her to see the performance, Machi caves pretty much right away.

I kind of wish Naru's dreamy nature and love of books and fairy tales would continue to be played up, but I still like her. Her voice kind of sounds like Kana Hanazawa, which fits her perfectly. We also saw more of her father as he wonders what's going on with Naru these days and fears she might have become a delinquent with a boyfriend, and we see (the back of) her older sister, who apparently does all the housework. Yaya is probably my favorite character so far. I often like tsundere in moe shows, where they're more light on the tsun and heavy on the dere, and so easier to believe in as brassy and blunt girls than the over-the-top screaming of the tsundere equivalence class under Rie Kugimiya. Plus, she's adorable as a yuri girl with a yuri crush on Naru. I kind of wish we could see more of them togther, but Naru is always with Hana. (Naru and Hana are cute together, but I prefer Naru and Yaya.)

I didn't really like Sally-sensei. She's a little bit more believable than Sawako-sensei from K-On, in that I understand her desire not to get too involved with the students when she's just a temporary substitute, but I typically don't really like the crazy teacher unless they're surpassingly hilarious, and she's not. (It wouldn't fit this show to have someone like that anyway.) She gives the girls the cosplay animal ears and tails and suggests doing maid outfits or school swimsuits. (/Yawn/.) But she and Machi seem to have some kind of feud going on, and that might make her more interesting, or at least it might make Machi more interesting, so she might serve a purpose. Machi herself is very lightly developed so far, but I hope the writers will do something interesting to reconcile her hard-ass, by the book approach so far with someone who's in love with Tami and ends up joining something like the yosakoi club. (As several of the commenters pointed out, she strongly resembles Mirai Kuriyama from Kyoukai no Kanata, even having the same glasses. Mirai was shorter and had more of a plumpness about her than Machi, though.)

Even though Hanayamata is adorable and moe, I can certainly see a case that it's a shoujo "power of friendship" show too, but the relationships among the girls are much more intricate than the kind of friendship you're normally see in a show like that, so it still works. Even so, I was wondering how much longer it was going to work, but in these episodes the relationships continued to be strong and we also got some nice humor to go with it. I kind of blank out during the power of friendship speeches, and usually forget what was said, but the girls are cute and fun enough to keep me with the show. The animation's also not as good as I thought originally—it kind of shies away from the dancing scenes, though it does come through in the performance in Episode 8. The art is as good as I thought, though: bright, colorful, fluid, and elegant, just like the yosakoi props it's inspired by. And the character designs are adorable, but just a bit more realistic than the Itaru Hinoue-like designs that a lot of moe shows have. I suspect this was just considered a throwaway show by the studio, so they made it good but not great, and that's kind of a shame. I think it's going to be another sleeper, like One Week Friends and Gochiusa. Except both of those had higher production values, and as far as the writing quality, we have One Week Friends >= Hanayamata >  Gochiusa. One Week Friends was just a bit more consistently written. When Hanayamata is good, it's as good as One Week Friends, but One Week Friends was good with greater frequency—almost every minute of almost every episode was well done, whereas Hanayamata, while it's never bad, is sometimes less good than I would like. (Yes, the power of friendship speeches sometimes go on a little longer than I'd prefer. Never ever long enough to make me stop watching the show, though.) Gochiusa had better animation than Hanayamata and the art was about equally good, but although it also has a cast of adorable girls who equal the Hanayamata girls in the individual category, the Hanayamata girls soundly win in the group category. (Also, the Gochiusa girls may be individually equal in adorability, but the Hanayamata girls are certainly deeper in personality and backstory.)
** Episodes 9 and 10 <2014-11-03 Mon>
Unfortunately, this was a weaker couple of episodes than last time. Although Hanayamata is better at drama than many moe shows, it’s still at its best when it’s doing humor and moe (the scenes with Yaya in Episode 7 notwithstanding, as they were actually some of the best scenes in the show so far).

Poor Naru falls down, but Hana and the others encourage her to get up and finish the routine. Afterwards, she apologizes and says she always gets jelly legs in front of people, but Yaya and Tami say they already knew that and they’re there for her. Hana collapses with a fever. This was the real cause of Naru’s fall; Hana lost time because of her fever, which confused Naru and made her freeze up, in conjunction with her self-doubting thoughts and bad memories.

Hana comes back healed up after three days, only for the girls to discover that Sally can’t be their advisor since she’s a temporary teacher, and she’s been hiding it from them that they’ll be disbanded at the end of the year if they don’t find a real advisor. Machi, who told them about this, also tells them they don’t need a lame-ass like Sally as their advisor anyway. Tami starts trying to reunite the two sisters by getting them together for lunch, sticking pictures of Sally in Machi’s textbook, spreading glowing student evaluations of Sally across Machi’s desk in the student council room, and putting love letters in her shoe locker, but Machi strongly resists. 

It turns out that Machi is angry at Sally because when Sally was younger, she was an excellent student who excelled at everything, but she left home, telling Machi that test scores were meaningless, after Machi worked hard to be like her. Their parents apparently own a hospital, and they wanted Sally to take over from them, but Sally didn’t want to and so left home to be a teacher. After a confrontation where Tami shows Machi how Sally is learning yosakoi and helping them out with their practice, Tami tells Machi that she talked to Sally and Sally purposely chose to teach at this school where she could only get a substitute position because Machi was there, and that she decided to become a teacher after she tutored Machi when they were younger and realized she enjoyed teaching. Sally has been trying to get on full-time at the school and applied for an exam that would help her do so. Machi stops being mad at her and goes to see her. Sally gives a V-sign to show that she passed her exam. Tami tells Machi later that she ought to join the Yosakoi Club, and Machi says she’ll consider it.

This episode was...not great. I was disappointed in how the main plot went down. Machi caved way too fast for how angry she was before. The part where she caved made sense, because she thinks how she’s now also been under their parents’ pressure and understands how Sally felt, and reveals that she knew about the hospital thing. They had promised to be doctors together, but Sally broke her promise when she left to be a teacher. Apparently Machi was mad that she broke this promise, but on the other hand, Machi apparently knew exactly why she left, so I just didn’t understand why she was so angry in the first place. Given how unreliable and lame Sally is, I was expecting an Ore Imo-like payoff where Machi was disappointed because Sally wasn’t cool anymore, but it turned out to be something totally different and totally confusing.

I suspect that the writers knew they weren’t getting a Season II and they wanted to get Machi introduced before the end, but they didn’t want to abridge the beginning too much, so they delayed as much as they could and then forced it in really fast so there would be time to do the Hanairo Festival. I thought Machi was an interesting character, so I wanted her plot to be good, and it really wasn’t.

Episode 10 was better, fortunately. It starts with Machi showing up on the roof with Tami. So far, nothing good has ever happened when she showed up on the roof, but Machi announces brazenly that she is now entering the Yosakoi Club. Yaya and Naru aren’t sure about this, but Hana, with dreams of the perks from having the Student Council President as a member of her club, welcomes Machi and says they’ll treat her as a VIP. (Apparently having the vice president as a member is pretty useless. Well, that’s about like the US Vice President too; about the best thing you could get from being friends with the vice president is an introduction to the president.)

In order to get ready for the Hanairo Festival, the girls decide to have a training camp at the reserved room that Tami’s family keeps at a ryokan. They go to Hana’s house to plan things out. Yaya is surprised at how cute Hana’s room is, and Hana says her father keeps buying her cute things because he wants her to be more girly, but she doesn’t like it and wants to be boyish. (That’s not very American. That’s un-American!)  Hana’s father comes in and serves everyone drinks, saying that Hana should try to be like a Japanese yamato nadeshiko, then tries to advertise his English language school while Hana screams over him the whole time trying to get him to stop advertising and leave. Hana says her mother and father are divorced and she was living with her mother, but she decided to come stay with her father. (Now that’s totally American. Good job, Hana’s dad!)

Hana wants to plan out what they’re going to do at the training camp, but Machi says it’s very simple: they’ll wake up, eat, practice, eat, sleep, wake up, eat, practice, leave. However, Hana needs to change the choreography to incorporate a fifth person, and Naru wants to redesign the logo, and Yaya and Tami also plan to do new music. Machi asks them to record their current routine so she can watch it and practice on her own, which Sally does, salaciously. Machi works hard trying to match the routine, while everyone else stays up late doing their work and is exhausted the next morning. Hana, Tami, and Yaya are done with their parts (Yaya and Tami collaborated remotely, with Yaya composing the music, Tami playing it, and Yaya mixing), but Naru’s logo isn’t quite done yet. 

Upon arriving, they practice in the room, but are asked to keep it down by the hotel manager, so they practice on the river bank. Machi’s firm and strict nature turns off the others a little, and Yaya lightly tries to warn her a few times, but she doesn’t take the hint and keeps pushing, until she finds out that they missed the deadline to enter the Hanairo Festival and accuses them all of being disorganized and lame. However, she still wants to practice hard so they won’t have wasted their trip, even though everyone is tired and Hana is unconscious from staying in the bath too long.  Yaya tells her that she’s being too strict, but Machi won’t hear it and leaves the room. (Yaya says “Look at the state Hana’s in”, and Machi says “That’s just because she stayed up all night and then stayed in the bath too long.”)

Sally returns from her fun time eating onsen tamago and drinking, and tells them not to be too hard on Machi and to go check out the courtyard. Naru speaks up and says she agrees with Machi they even if they aren’t entering the festival, she wants to practice hard, and everyone else comes around too. They go to the courtyard and find Machi practicing, realizing that she was working twice as hard because she has to catch up to the others. Yaya says as the second-newest member, it’s her responsibility to train Machi and that Machi can call her Sempai if she wants. (Yaya has been calling Machi Sempai since Machi is a third-year and Yaya, Hana, and Naru are second-years.) The five of them train together in the courtyard, attracting some of the other guests to come watch. Machi tells them all that they’re doing yosakoi, a traditional dance from Kochi which is now very freestyle, and that they’re the Yuihama Middle School Yosakoi Club, and they do an impromptu performance. 

Afterwards, Sally says she called Masaru and he spoke to the organizers of the Hanairo Festival, who allowed the girls to join since another team dropped out. Back at school, the others ask Machi why she joined the Yosakoi Club, and she blushes and says it looked fun. Naru announces that she has an idea for the logo. She explains that she based it on flowers that correspond to everyone’s personalities, with herself the fragile and pale sakura, Hana the dynamic and bright bluestar, Yaya the beautiful yet thorny rose, and Tami the elegant white lily. (Could that also be a covert comment on her and Machi’s feelings towards Tami?) She couldn’t think of which flower fit Machi, but now she knows that Machi is the upstanding, influential, yet bright, sunflower. Machi is delighted yet embarrassed by this characterization. (By the way, those are my explanations of why she chose those flowers. When Naru chose the sakura for herself, she said it was because she had only recently gained color, and she explains to everyone why she chooses the sunflower for Machi, but she never explained her choices for Hana, Yaya, and Tami on screen.)

In the last scene, we see a blonde woman in the airport who has to be Hana’s mother.

I feel Episode 10 was also a victim of time dilation. (Or rather, we had time dilation in Episodes 1–8, and now we’re experiencing time compression in order to adjust the timeline so things are still wrapped up in 12 episodes.) The story was kind of confusing and all over the place. But it was cute and fun, which is an improvment over the not very cute or fun Episode 9.  Probably Episodes 11 and 12 will be less compressed as they conclude the story.

For various reasons, I watched this show really quickly. I think it would have been better to watch it more slowly. Like many moe shows, it’s kind of like sweets; you can eat a bunch of it at once, but you won’t necessarily enjoy it as much as if you took the time to savor it.  

But after dumping on it a little, I have to step back and say that it really is a good show with its unique charm points, even if the writing can be uneven. One big charm point is the uniqueness of the characters. Most moe shows use a classical setup with crazy characters and serious characters and personalities which are archetypal or mix a few archetypes, and it’s because the characters are such an important component of a moe show and if they don’t work out, the series pretty much fails, so the authors decide not to take chances on basic traits and to bet the bundle on execution. But, whether by accident or design, Hanayamata doesn’t really follow this model. Instead, its characters all feel like unique people. I could point out similar characters in other shows (e.g. Hana is a little bit like Kaolla Su, Yaya is a little like Azu-nyan, Tami is a little like Ujimatsu Chiya from Gochiusa, Naru is like a combination of Nadeko Sengoku and Akari Mizunashi), but it never feels like you can completely describe the characters with Lego blocks like that. Whenever I come up with a Lego block for a character, it’s not just that I have to snap on another block to fully describe that aspect; I actually have to make a new mold, which might look slightly similar to the old one, but which is different enough that I couldn’t just add more blocks.  You could divide the girls into crazy characters (Hana and Tami) and serious characters (Yaya and Machi) and independents (Naru) like I did with K-On and Gochiusa, but it’s not really a useful way to understand the narrative like it is with those shows. 

I think it’s because each character has a unique way of relating to every other character, and because no character’s role is entirely described by an archetype, that it feels this way. Even though Hana is a hyper and outgoing character, she’s also determined and responsible and kind of a charmer, even for the people who she makes trouble for (Yaya), and it was interesting to hear that she and her father have disagreements about her tomboyish nature. Yaya may be mildly tsundere, but she’s very able to express her emotions when she wants to, without being embarrassed. It’s interesting that she takes it on herself to take care of Machi in Episode 10, acting as sort of a check on Machi by hinting to her what the other members are feeling. (Hana and Naru might still be afraid of her, and the club would fragment if only Tami talked to her.) K-On also did this, by establishing relationships between any given pair of club members and by making each character feel unique and not tied to any given archetype. So apparently, character uniqueness is next to K-Onliness, but that’s not catchy at all.

Hanayamata also has kind of a theme of going against the expectations of parents and society to do something different or unconventional, which I find interesting, especially in an anime. Tami’s decision to stop trying to please her father, and Sally’s decision to become a teacher, and even Hana’s tomboy personality set against her father’s expectations of girliness, all illustrate this theme. I kind of think Machi might have joined for this reason too; she’s now also been oppressed by her parents’ expectations, and she saw Tami break out and join the Yosakoi Club, something purely fun and not at all useful or expected. Yaya’s parents own a noodle shop, and they make her work pretty heavily in there, so I can’t imagine they’d be thrilled with her band or her participation in yosakoi. Naru’s father also seems to be very traditional, although we haven’t seen enough of him yet to know what his opinion of his daughter doing yosakoi would be (he might just be relieved that she’s not a delinquent with a boyfriend). Everyone except Hana has a sort of traditional family with definite expectations for their children, and everyone except Hana seems to view doing yosakoi as a somewhat rebellious act. (We don’t know what Hana’s father thinks about it, but yosakoi is definitely more girly than free running or ninjutsu, so he might be happy about that.) By comparison, the K-On girls’ families never seem to have any expectations for them or care if they’re in a band. (If anything, Yui’s family views her dedication to music as a good thing, though she was such a lame-ass that I guess it was just good to know she was interested in anything other than eating and sleeping.)

It’s too bad there are only two episodes left. It’s not often nowadays that I think an anime actually needed to take more time; usually, it’s pretty on-point, and some shows really didn’t need to take as much time as they do. The pacing of Episodes 1–8 was pretty good, but Episodes 9 and 10 both felt rushed; not only were the stories confusing and broken, they didn’t include as much humor or cuteness, and they didn’t savor what they did have very much. Not only do I think the material in these episodes went by too fast, I also think there’s still quite a bit to see from these characters going forward, so I wish there would be a Season II, even though I doubt there will be. 

Random stuff:

In Episode 8, when Sally called Machi to bring the CD down, Machi’s phone said “Sari” and it looked like it was written in kanji. (To be clear, the subtitles said “Sari”, and there appeared to be kanji on Machi’s phone, not サリ like there would be if it was actually “Sally”.) So I don’t know if she’s actually Sari and Sally is a nickname (like Linda-san in Golden Time) or if she’s actually Sari and Sally is the result of some misunderstanding by the translators (like “Lala-chan” in Nisemonogatari, which was actually “Rara-chan” because it comes from “A/rara/gi”). She is an English teacher, so the “nickname” theory is plausible. Plus, the first one we ever hear mention her name is Hana, who could have taken it upon herself to nickname her teacher “Sally”, causing the others to take up that name too. (Although actually, I think random female students were calling her that. By the way, does Hana ace English, being American? Or is it like how most Americans would fail ESL courses because they explicitly test all these obscure points of grammar that native speakers aren’t consciously aware of?)

Tami’s voice actress is Yuka Otsubo, who played Toshinou Kyouko in Yuru Yuri. Her voice sounds totally different here, though. It has this interesting depth and hollowness to it that kind of reminds me of Houko Kuwashima. (I’m also rewatching Clannad right now, so I’ve heard Tomoyo’s voice recently.)

Hana’s full name is Hana N. Fountainstand (sometimes written Fontaine-Stand). What does N. stand for? Nicole? 
** Episode 11 <2014-11-04 Tue>
The girls find the roof to hot to practice, so they move down to the pool and the others manage to convince the bashful Naru and Tami to practice in their swimsuits.

The Hanairo Festival is coming up, and Naru has finished the costumes. She made a haori jacket for each member printed with a theme of the flower she represents. Tami found some paper parasols for them to incorporate into the routine, and Yaya suggests they record some lyrics for the the song and passes out lyrics sheets; everyone is surprised and delighted when Machi suggests a cuter way of phrasing something, and Yaya immediately incorporates her suggestion. But Hana is hiding the fact that her mother came and said she wants to get back together with her father and bring them back to the US, meaning she won’t be there for the festival. 

Naru can tell something is wrong with Hana, but Hana won’t tell anyone what it is. Naru thinks at first that Hana’s mother is being hard on her, since she and Yaya saw a text where Hana’s mother said if Hana’s grades weren’t good, she’d bury her. (It was in English, and the English was actually pretty good, although I don’t think whoever wrote it totally understood the finer points of the usage of “gonna”. But at least it was always grammatical; they never wrote “I gonna seeing you.”) Hana says she did well in math and science, but she failed Japanese and English; when Machi asks how she failed English, Hana says it’s because the questions are written in Japanese. (Then how did she do math and science? I guess with those you at least have the numbers and symbols.) Naru also notices that Hana’s mother is making lunch for her, and even though it’s weird (she comes to school with the foods of five different cultures in her bentou box, which is very American. Good job, Hana’s mother!), Naru recognizes the love for Hana that her mother put in. 

On the day before she’s due to leave, Hana shows up at Naru’s window crying and tells Naru everything. They have a sleepover, taking a bath together and staying up late in Naru’s bed to talk. Naru wakes up the next morning and finds a note from Hana on the pillow. She brings the note to the club, telling everyone that Hana is leaving and reading them what’s in the note. Hana wrote that she had a lot of fun with them and she’s really glad she got to dance yosakoi with them, even though she’s sorry that she asked them all to join and then left like this. 

Yaya asks what plane Hana’s on, and the girls decide to go the airport and see Hana off. We see Hana’s father say goodbye and tell Hana he’ll be along once they find someone to replace him at the English school. Naru, Yaya, Tami, and Machi manage to catch Hana while she’s standing in line at the terminal. Yaya says they’re not going to be mad, they’re just going to see her off, but then calls her “baka yarou” and says she should have told them. Hana apologizes and says it was too hard for her. Naru says they’ll make sure to dance well enough to make up for her absence at the Hanairo Festival, and Hana leaves with her mother, who seems happy that her friends came to see her off. (Hana apparently never told her parents about the whole yosakoi thing—she mentioned something about this in her note to Naru—but her father, at least, knew that she had friends at school.)

I decided to slow down a bit for the ending, so I didn’t watch the last episode. Episode 11 was good: not at the top level for this series, but pretty near to it. Hana and Naru’s sleepover was really cute, as were the scenes with Hana’s mother. There was also a cute scene towards the beginning where Tami jumps in the pool to cool off after they practice in their swimsuits. She playfully pulls in Naru, and then pulls in Hana, but Hana can’t swim, so Sally-sensei has to go in and rescue her.  

I halfway expect that Hana is going to show up again before the dance and go on with everyone. I’m glad they didn’t make too big a deal out of her departure scene, though. It was cute, understated, and didn’t bother to bash us over the head with how sad she was to be leaving. And the others were happy for her that her mother and father were getting back together, as good friends should be. Overall, Episode 11 did a good job of mixing cuteness, drama, and humor.

I still think the best episode was Episode 7, and in general all three of the Yaya episodes, Episodes 2, 3, and 7, were my favorites. (And I guess I’d say Yaya was my favorite character, too.) I kind of think what I really would’ve like to see from Hanayamata was for it to slow down, cool it on the drama, and just luxuriate in the adorability of the characters, kind of like K-On. This is what Gochiusa did, and it was hit and miss, but I think Hanayamata was at a much higher level than Gochiusa when it did that kind of thing—c.f. Episode 3, which was mostly pointless from a story perspective, but was totally adorable. I would have liked to see Naru and Yaya’s makeup date. Hanayamata also has humor at a much higher level than Gochiusa did, especially in Episodes 1 and 2 when Naru is running away from Hana.

K-On also had drama kind of like Hanayamata, but it didn’t drag itself through the drama or let itself get tied up in knots with overly intricate dramatic setup, like what happens to Hanayamata in Episodes 9 and 10. In fact, when I watched K-On Series II again recently, many of the dramatic scenes that I thought dragged on forever turned out to be only about a third of an episode, and they actually go by quite fast. No single episode of K-On was mostly drama, the way Episode 9 of Hanayamata was.

Still, Hanayamata is good, because it’s even comparable to K-On at all in quality. In fact, it’s the only moe show I can think of outside the Key canon (pun) that compares to K-On’s unique mixture of moe and drama, and although I think the ratio of moe to drama is misaligned in Hanayamata, I have to admit that a lot of the humor is more intelligent than K-On. K-On’s humor was silly and kind of offbeat; it made things funny that shouldn’t have been funny, like the revolving door scene in the movie, because it had the audacity and unselfconsciousness to even present material like that, and the adorability to make you laugh at such dorky jokes. (TVTropes describes the entire cast of K-On as “adorkable”, which is really a pretty good way to sum them up.) Hanayamata’s humor is somewhat similar, but the actual scenarios are more clever, so it doesn’t give me that simultaneous feeling of “That is damn funny” and “Why is that funny?”. Episode 11 had what I think would be a good mixture of moe and drama for a dramatic episode, and I think the default mode should be more like Episode 3.

In the great tapestry of moe shows, Hanayamata has a unique spot as a shoujo-like moe show (shared somewhat with GA). I hope that in a little while, I can come back to this series and find more to enjoy about it. Maybe I can even hope a little for a sequel. 

Below is my character ranking, since I have to have one for every moe show.

*** Character Ranking
**** 1. Sasame Yaya
Yaya is a great lightweight tsundere and responsible best friend. I thought it was really cute how she loves Naru and how she’s become accustomed to Naru stroking her ego a little bit, and seems to miss that when Naru starts hanging out with other people. (Like asking “Aren’t I also beautiful and dazzling like a princess?” when Naru was talking about Tami.) I also enjoyed how she took to Machi right away when Machi joined; in Episodes 10 and 11, it seems to be Yaya who usually talks to Machi when anyone does. I would’ve liked to see more NaYa, and also some YaMa and YaTa.
**** 2. Sekiya Naru
Naru comes in second because she’s adorable. She kind of reminds me of Kami Nomi’s Shiori Shiomiya, but unlike Shiori, she has Yaya to support her and keep her in the human world and prevent her from withdrawing into a fortress of books. I also thought it was interesting that she practices iaido, and we never do find out why. (I assume her father does it, but she totally doesn’t seem like the type who would follow him for that reason, and he doesn’t seem like he would want her to.) Naru faded a lot from importance after Episode 4 (other than a few significant scenes in Episode 7), which is too bad, because she’s mega-cute. NaYa (Naru and Yaya) is my major ship in this show, though I also like MaTa. (It’s so easy to use lame ship names when they title of the show already intentionally includes them as substrings.)
**** 3. Hana N. Fountainstand
I wanted Machi to be here, but based on what was actually in the show, it had to be Hana. I like how her design combined the concept of a beautiful blonde, blue-eyed foreign girl with a wild tomboy by making her look like a young wild fox or cat, with her fangs and her round face and her thin figure. (She climbs like a wild animal, too.) The way she’s written and designed do a good job of making her actually feel American, and not like the conception of an American of someone who’s never been outside of Narita Ward. (E.g. her boyishness—springing from her love of ninjas and superheroes and her practice of free running—but also girlishness, with her long blonde hair and stylish clothes. Also her way of dealing with people, which is straightforward, but not overbearing or rude, at least by American standards.)
**** 4. Tokiwa Machi
Machi is interesting and I really wanted to like her and to know more about her, but her plot was really hurried and the finale had to be a group thing, so she’s become sort of a background character and we won’t get to find out about her. I wanted to see more of her and Tami. (Actually, I’ve realized that that was a big thing for me in these last few episodes—I wanted to see more moe relationship-building like we got earlier on, and less drama.)
**** 5. Nishimikado Tami
Even though Tami was kind of boring, I was hoping seeing her with Machi (or maybe with Naru) would make her more interesting. She’s not a bad character, but after she joins, she doesn’t really do much. She’s definitely pretty, and her throaty voice is unique and cute. (It sounds like a cross between Minako Kotobuki’s Mugi and Houko Kuwashima’s Tomoyo Sakagami.) I wanted to see what happened between her and her father after she decided to quit all her lessons and do yosakoi.
**** 6. Tokiwa Sally
As crazy teachers go, she’s not the best. Actually, I can’t even think of a great crazy teacher character. The best I could come up with when I tried was Kojiro from Bamboo Blade. And I guess if ninja teachers count, Hatake Kakashi was a pretty good character, at least by Naruto standards. Yukari-sensei from Azumanga Daioh was one of the better female ones, and Lucky Star’s Nanako Kuroi managed to look good and not get in the way too much. Kami Nomi’s Nagase Jun was pretty good but not quite crazy enough. Fate/Stay Night’s Taiga Fujimura was all right, but she had three major advantages going for her: she also lived with Shirou and was able to capitalize on her misguided feelings of possessiveness over him for humorous purposes; she was in a dark, dour show where even the tiniest hint of humor is eagerly seized upon and fought over with Kinoko Nasu like starving wolves fighting over a rabbit; and she had Illyasviel von Einzbern, one of the most bizarre characters in all of anime (a cute moe murderous psychotic amoral oniichanko orphan albino loli used as a weapon by uncaring adults for their own mysterious purposes), meaning that some of her jokes practically wrote themselves. 

Among them all, Sally is closest to Sawako Yamanaka, and sorry to say, Sawako would not even place if there was a best crazy teacher contest, unless you were limited to choosing between her and Saori Shikijo from Mahoromatic. Then Sawako would sweep the awards. Sally does manage to be less annoying than Sawako, mostly by not being around as much, and also because Hanayamata is more realistic than K-On, so a teacher who forcibly strips her student and dresses that student up in fetish gear is sued and fired.
