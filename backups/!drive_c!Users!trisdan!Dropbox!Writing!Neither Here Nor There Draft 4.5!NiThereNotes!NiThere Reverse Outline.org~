* Neither Here Nor There Reverse Outline

I'm trying to reconstruct just what the hell happened in Neither Here Nor There (Draft 4.5). Then we'll see if I can fix it and maybe release it.

** Note
<2014-03-16 Sun> I think I finally have a way to move forward with this train wreck.

The world still needs some fixing, but it's a lot closer after the changes I made during the writing of Draft 4. And it's almost at a point where I could stand for it to be the same world that Strawberry Sunflower is in (though I'd have to account for the animal people, and StrawSun is in a more civilized area than Sakura Memorial, so there's actual police and everything is peaceful and nice). 

Rather than this gigantic mess I have here, I think it'd be better to do things in individual stories, like Monogatari or Clannad. That is, we'd have the Mariko story, the Ai story, the Yumiko story, and the Akari story. (But I'm going to change all their names.)  A large part of what's happened so far would be in the Yumiko story, though Arishil's parts and episode 9 would all be in the Ai story. Keep everything in order and figure out what you want to say, then move forward, and don't be afraid of scene breaks and short scenes. (Like in Of Night.) 

I want to use some material from the game, particularly for the Mariko story. After the Mariko story, Mariko and Yuji have a falling out and that lasts until the very end of the Ai story (and of the book) when Yuji is killed by Ai but comes back to life. 

** episode 1

*** Summary
The reality of his parents' divorce suddenly sinks in because of a letter from the law firm, and Yuji gets angry and leaves the house to clear his head. He goes to the park to sit in his spot on the hill where he can view Lake Hybrea. He tries not to let himself go inside and buy a video game.

While there, Ai comes up and speaks to him, expressing sympathy for his feelings about his parents' divorce. After she leaves, Yuji goes in and buys a game anyway.

The next day, Yuji goes to school by train. While on the train, he is knocked over by Mariko, who is chasing a thief that stole her watch, a memento of her grandfather. Mariko is angry, but overcomes her anger quickly and engages him in conversation, recognizing him as Yuji Watanabe, a manga artist. She tells Yuji that she's bought a doujinshi he worked on at SaComi (Sakura Comic Festival). 

Yuji meets Allen telling Jolie Rokudo, a popular girl at school, a fictitious story about him fighting Butch Christensen, a well-known bully. Allen admits to Yuji that the story is fake and then tells Yuji that he doesn't want to date Jolie since she was taken in too easily by his story. Allen then notices and points out Ai, who Yuji recognizes.

Ai comes to Yuji's science class and introduces herself. Since Yuji's table is empty, she ends up sitting with him. Since the end of the school year is approaching, there is no actualy work and the students are just reading out of the textbook. 

Yuji and Allen are eating lunch in the cafeteria when they notice Butch Christensen bullying another boy. Allen asks Yuji if he'll interfere, to which Yuji says he will not. Yuji insists that fighting a person requires more than raw strength, though Allen says that Yuji could easily destroy Christensen as he did when he and Allen first met (implying that Yuji rescued Allen from bullying, and this is how they met). Allen points out Ai, who is looking for somewhere to sit, and Yuji invites her to sit with them. Allen clumsily tries to romance her, and Ai picks up on a reference to a MASH manga, /Sakura no Kaado Taisen/. Yuji, Allen, and Ai decide to go out to eat, and Allen takes them to a Jewish deli, where they also meet Mariko. Mariko, Yuji, and Ai speak Japanese and make fun of Allen for not being able to (since he never comes to class). 

It turns out that Yuji, Allen, Mariko, and Ai all have PE together. The PE classes are split in half, with each sex playing half the period, due to low budgets. Yuji notices approvingly during the girls' game that Mariko supports Ai. When the boys' turn comes up, Yuji gets annoyed and reveals some of his true powerj, blowing through several of his opponents before remembering to control himself and stopping.

In [[social studies]], Yuji gets annoyed when his teacher makes disparaging remarks about the Japanese (since he is half Japanese and half Irish) and disputes the teacher. The teacher gets angry and dismisses him from class. 

Yuji leaves without going to the office. He waits outside until school gets out and then meets up with Mariko and Ai, who invite him to walk home together, since they both live in Proastio Heights.

On the train, the three talk about Ai's family and she tells them that she's there with her mother and her father and brothers are elsewhere. They drop Ai off at her house and Mariko and Yuji go on to Mariko's house. Outside, Mariko asks Yuji what kind of girl he's interested in and Yuji punts, saying he likes girls made of ink and paint or zeros and ones.

*** social studies
The social studies scene is stupid. Change it in any revision. Maybe make the teacher have some sort of extreme political view (like Of Night's Latrom) that Yuji disagrees with.

** episode 2 - Symbollica Brutallae
*** Summary
Yuji has been suspeneded because of his fight with the teacher. He and Allen discuss how he's coming back tomorrow and how unlikely it is for someone like him to be suspended. Allen says it's the /symbollica brutallae/ of the modern age. He claims this is Latin for "symbol of brutality". 

Yuji asks how Ai and Mariko have been during his absence and Allen says Ai has become Butch Christensen's girlfriend. [[ROTC plotline]]. Yuji is worried for her and thinks that he intends to talk to her tomorrow about going out with such a dangerous person. 

Yuji wakes up and rides the train to school the next day. On the way, he sees the thief who stole Mariko's watch. (That I stole from Edward Elric's watch in Full Metal Alchemist.) When the thief takes it out, Yuji confronts him and takes the watch back by attacking a pressure point. 

Yuji sees Mariko as they go to the school and calls to her. He gives her the watch and asks her about Ai's new boyfriend. Mariko expresses some skepticism about Ai's choice but says it's not her place to interfere.

During lunch, Yuji and Allen see Butch bullying Ai to bully Raine, the one female member of the chess club, and steal her lunch money. Allen asks Yuji to do something, but Yuji refuses and gets angry when Allen tells him he's wrong. Yuji tells Allen to do something about it himself if he's that concerned. Allen gets angry and leaves the table. 

Yuji goes to the park after school to rest. A nagging voice in his head tells him Allen is right and he should kill Butch Christensen. It then tells him to kill Allen and "the girl" (Ai) as well. Yuji goes to a cool thicket near the bridge over the river that feeds the lake. While there, he runs into Ai, who is crying. Yuji asks if her ankle (which has a large welt on it) hurts and Ai says it doesn't. She then asks if he's ever read /The Handmaid's Tale/ and says "context is everything". She asks him not to tell anyone, and Yuji says he won't, as long as she comes back to the thicket every day.

The next day, Yuji and Ai meet at the thicket again, and Ai asks if he's ever read /The Mists of Avalon/. Yuji says yes, and when asked what he thinks it was about, says he thinks it's about duty and free will and how they interact. After hearing that he draws manga, Ai gives Yuji her permission to draw her; he does so, and she asks if she can have it. The next day, Butch discovers the drawing and recognizes it as Yuji's style, associating it with Allen. Butch breaks her pinky out of anger. 

Ai fetches Yuji and tells him the ROTC group is beating up Allen. Yuji thrashes them all and tells Allen and Ai to stick with him for the rest of the year to avoid any revenge attempts by Butch and his gang. 

Ai is absent the next day because of her finger. After school, the other three (including Mariko) go over to see her. Ai lets them in and serves them tea and cookies. Her mother comes back part of the way through and meets them. Yuji finds it odd how unconcerned she is about her daughter's broken finger, and discovers that she's his father's new secretary. 

Yuji and his mother discuss Yuji's new friends, as well as the odd behavior of his sister, Shoko, a cancer survivor, who is now thirteen and going through a rebellious stage. Shoko comes back dressed like a little hooker and asks for money.

Yuji and Ai sit by the canal behind the school and Yuji asks why she went out with Butch and warns her never to try and trap him into fighting like that again. Ai says she knows he's a nyvamna because the way he fought was so precise and skillful. He tells her he has the power of air dancing, which creates a low gravity field around him, allowing him to do /Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon/-like kung fu. He asks her not to tell anyone. 

*** ROTC plotline
It's stupid. Sure, Ai is weak. That was the point of the whole thing. But why in God's name would she date Butch? I can see what I was doing here — trying to create an analogy to the later plotline with Van — but it's just not working for me. Why would she date Butch?

So, what to do instead? Almost nothing actually happens in the chapter — it pretty much exists just to show Yuji's powers. And of course, something has to happen to make him snap after he was so against using his powers. Also, Ai had to be under some kind of duress so she and Yuji can have this nice little conspiratorial relationship where they're meeting by the bridge. 

My first inclination is to cut almost all (90%) of this chapter. But then, the utter pointlessness is sort of this book's /raison d'être/. It's sort of like Monogatari except without the part where it's good (maybe we can change that, though). But definitely come up with a better plot. Maybe Butch is trying to get Ai to go out with him and threatens her. Maybe what Butch do and what Ai does are totally unrelated and the conversations they have are about marrying Prince Van (which Ai knows is one possible future for her, along with becoming the core of a computer). 
** episode 3 - Let's Be Friends
*** Summary
Yuji and Mariko are waiting in Mariko's house for Ai. Mariko suggests they have sex, but Yuji says he just wants to be friends and Mariko claims she was joking. (Yuji has been established as a not-very-sexual person by this point.) Ai arrives, and the three of them go to the arcade and play video games. Afterward, they go the bistro where Yumiko works as a waitress to celebrate [[Mariko's birthday]], but Yumiko behaves unpleasantly towards Yuji and Ai, so Yuji leaves.

Mariko comes to Yuji's house later to apologize, but Yuji says it's not her fault. Mariko once again "jokes" about having sex with Yuji and then tells him she's a nyvamna. While they talk, Yuji's father calls and asks him to stay out of school on Monday and to come to the office around midday. Yuji does so, and his father sends him to interview for a job with [[Angel Strike]], a company that makes eroge, as an artist. While waiting, he sees a news report that his school has been taken over by an esper criminal, [[Hayro Miba]], who has a really stupid name that I came up with off the top of my head back in the third draft and then never changed.

Yuji goes back to the school in a painfully long scene and sneaks into the auditorium. Miba has locked everyone in the auditorium and is telling them about how great and powerful he is. Mariko suddenly attacks him, and Yuji joins in; together, they defeat him and leave him for the police to take care of. Yuji offers to let Mariko have the credit in return for taking care of the rest.  

*** Mariko's birthday
Mention this earlier. It's fine if they're hanging out because it's Mariko's birthday, but don't have her just suddenly bring it up. Similarly, don't make the decision to visit Yumiko's work so sudden. 

*** Hayro Miba
His name is really stupid. Also, this plot was not too bad as far as I can tell (I skimmed a lot), but it is pretty underplayed, like many of the plots in this book. If an evil esper is taking over the school, that should probably be a longer plotline than half a chapter, the other half of which is a pointless trip to the arcade and a restaurant.

*** Angel Strike
They are now the makers of Beikon Iro no Kiseki as elaborated in the game catalogue in the notes folder. 

** episode 4 - Dream With Me
*** Summary
Mariko, Yumiko, and Ai are all getting drunk together soon after the Miba incident. Ai apparently managed to talk Miba into letting people use the bathroom during the incident, which Yumiko is impressed with (not knowing that it's because Ai is Miba's cousin, Andromache, and is also much more powerful than he is). 

The girls get totally plastered and Yumiko decides they need to become sculptors to secure their futures, so they go out to learn how to sculpt. They head for the museum, but Yumiko instead leads them to the game center in the mall. A trading card event for a Yugioh-like card game is going on there. Ai sees Hans, the Matt Bus-like red-shirted, self-aggrandizing buffoon, make a bad deal with a kid for Manreeki the Unforgiving One. Ai tells the kid he is nauseating and repellent because he planend to sell his Manreeki and use the money to hire a lady of the evening. 

Hans follows Ai into the women's room and grabs her ass, then tries to corner her and rape her; Yumiko is also nearly cornered and raped in the stall by a man in dental headgear. Mariko bowls over both men and allows the three girls to escape.

The three girls meet the Elf Balm cast (sans Jinjo and Mirufa, who are currently working for Arishil, and Shinjo, who is just stated to be "gone"; Kaorin is also present, as Kayoko's sister rather than his daughter). The girls talk a bit and have food, then depart to continue their quest to become sculptors. 

They enter the museum, in another part of the park, and encounter Yunoki Amano, a girl with quad-colored hair who introduces herself saying "Hello, I'm Yunoki Amano and I'm a lesbian." (Yunoki is a holdout from the third draft; she was one of the four interchangeable girls that Yuji met at Half-Yule in the second draft. All four were expies of Tokimeki Memorial characters; the most significant was Miako, an expy of Mio Kisaragi, who tried to seduce Yuji in the third draft.) Yunoki says she must have Mariko's body, and Yumiko says she can't; when Yunoki asks if she's a lesbian, she says she's just a girl who loves another girl and can't stand to see that girl's body taken. 

Yunoki paints Mariko, except when it's all over it turns out she did the Jackson Pollock version of Mariko. Mariko gets angry and smashes everything, causing Yunoki to become first enraged and then aroused. Yumiko grabs the other two and drags them outside.

Mariko takes them to a bar and grill for a drink (not alcoholic). Yumiko and Mariko recall some of Yumiko's less than stellar boyfriends over the years. Ai orders another pitcher of beer, and the bartender orders them to take it outside since he doesn't want anyone cutting up inside. Yumiko sobs and says she wants to sleep with someone so bad she'd even consider having sex with Mariko.

Mariko leads them into the sports bar next door, where a card game is going on. While Mariko plays Go Fish, Yumiko is lured outside for a smoke by a guy in a white jumpsuit with an Achaean Wall and Painting logo on the back. Ai sees the guy and a partner tie up Yumiko and throw her in the back of a van. Ivan, one of Mariko's fellow card players, offers to drive them in pursuit. 

Yumiko wakes up and hears that her kidnappers are promiscuous drug-using homosexuals who speak Polari. Their names are Achilles and Patroclus. Ivan's car rams the van to make it stop. The chase ends at the edge of the park (where Lake Hybrea is — make that more clear in the future, maybe by [[giving the park a name]]) and Mariko punches out [[Achilles and Patroclus]] (in that order). They rescue Yumiko just in time to watch a beautiful sunrise above the park. As they sit, Yumiko decides that she hates everything she owns, from her glasses to her cell phone to her clothes. She strips naked and throws them all down the hill. [[Yumiko strips]].

The girls somehow get back to Ai's house and pass out on the floor (Yumiko stole an Achaean Wall and Painting jumpsuit). 

*** giving the park a name
Several times now, while reading the book, I've been confused by talk about "the park". Give the park a name. I didn't do it before because I was working from the second draft's assumption that it was the only park in town, but even if it is, that's confusing. Give the park a name. You know you want to.

*** Achilles and Patroclus
Mariko should first punch out Patroclus, and then Achilles gets angry and challenges her to single combat, saying he'll tie her corpse to his bumper and drag her around town (like Hector),  but Yumiko beats him on the head with a paint roller from the truck and he is defeated. 

*** Yumiko strips
Make her say she wants a new beginning when she strips and say that she's going to begin again from the surface to the innermost depths, starting with her clothes.

*** The chapter in general
It's weird. I kind of like it. For one thing, I feel like this chapter gives more insight into Yumiko's character than all her yelling at Yuji. We start to see that she's a lesbian (despite her claims that she just wants to have sex, the thing about sleeping with Mariko is too recurrent to dismiss). We also kind of see the underbelly sort of thing that Yumiko attracts. And it's fun. It's pointless, just like the first half of episode 3 and almost all of episode 2, but it's pointless in a fun way, unlike those. Plus, it's the only chapter so far that managed to reign in its scope enough to feel like it finished when it needed to and didn't gloss over any major events. Vote to keep.   
** episode 5 - Hylas and the Nymphette
*** Summary
Yuji and Allen are sitting at the mall, where Allen complains that his relationship with Jolie (revealed in episode 3, IIRC) isn't going anywhere. Allen then points out a cute girl who Yuji labels a "nymphette" (like Humbert Humbert's "nymphet", but more French). 

Mariko and Yuji are sitting together at the school after class is over and talking about Allen and the Miba incident. Yuji notices the same little girl from the mall being pushed around by Taz Richardson and his gang. Yuji and Mariko go to help her, with Yuji engaging them in speech with [[Sakura slang]], which is similar to Nadsat from /A Clockwork Orange/, but based on Japanese instead of Russian. Taz explains that the girl made fun of their accents, making him angry. Yuji persuades him to let her go with an apology in return for a doujinshi and avoiding a fight with him and Mariko. It also comes out during the fight that the girl is Yumiko's sister; after Taz and his gang leave, she asks for help finding Yumiko, but Mariko can't help because she has to watch her younger brother, Manfred "Fred" Takahashi. She volunteers Yuji to help; at first he doesn't want to, since he doesn't like Yumiko, but the girl, who introduces herself as Akari Kanzaki, persuades him to help. Yuji assumes Yumiko must be at work if she's not at school, so he brings Akari to the train station. On the train, Yuji scares off a perverted old man who feels up Akari.

Yuji gives Akari money to take a gondola across the lake to Yumiko and says he has to get home and prepare dinner. He goes home and finds Shoko in the living room getting intimate with an old man on the couch. Yuji chases off the old man and gets angry at Shoko, telling her he doesn't care if she wants to be stupid, but don't do it at his house.

Yuji shows up at Ai's house, drunk and rambling about what just happened. He tells Ai he doesn't like her because she apologizes too much. Ai persuades him that what Shoko's doing is wrong, and Yuji forces a kiss on her, then leaves.

The next day, he and Mariko talk about what happened. It turns out that Mariko set up a date to play with Akari, but she is called at the last minute to watch Fred again, so she shoves the duty off on Yuji. Yuji and Akari play together at the game center, where Yuji starts to see how sweet she is and can't understand how Yumiko and Akari's mother could leave such a cute little girl to run around on her own. 

Afterwards, they go over to the restaurant where Yumiko works. On the way, Yuji tells Akari that his sister is doing enjou kousai and asks what her opinion is. Akari says she would never do that because she believes in true love only. Yuji goes up with her to talk to Yumiko. He finds Ai there as well, and while Yumiko is away getting dinner for Akari, he talks to Ai about what happened and tells her he does like her, apologizing for what happened. Yumiko, who also engaged in prostitution when she was younger, offers to talk to Shoko about it, and Yuji agrees. Yumiko tells Shoko about her past([[Yumiko's past)]], but is ignored by Shoko. When Yumiko's words fail to move her, Ai begins to speak and tells Shoko about how upset Yuji was, while also applying her powers to soothe everyone (not mentioned explicitly, but that's what I meant when I wrote this scene). Both fail, and Shoko leaves. Akari hugs Yuji to comfort him.

*** Sakura slang
If I rewrite this book, lighten it up. For one thing, don't replace as many words. For another, don't do some of the more grotesque forms (like ecoo). Also, take out the Scottish Gaelic words like garrick, hrack, galla, etc. They don't fit; I just thought they sounded more "sweary" than anything in Japanese. Since this island is supposed to be in the Pacific, though, I might try to bring in some Tagalog swear words or Chinese swear words, which I think might be more sweary. I can also make some up, since there are nonexistent places like Montagria with nonexistent languages in this region.

*** Yumiko's past
I received criticism that this scene was too preachy and I kind of agree. Plus I think it's too long and too info-dumpy, and it doesn't quite square with what I said later about this period — Yumiko doesn't mention Eutsler at all, and this might be the time to bring him in.
** episode 6 - Negative Capability
*** Summary
Yuji is getting drunk at home after the end of episode 5 when Allen comes in. Allen tells him how he broke up with Jolie and Yuji tells him what happened with Shoko.

As Ai, Yumiko, and Akari leave the house, Yumiko suddenly gets mad at Akari, throws money at her, and leaves. Akari doesn't have anywhere else to go so she goes to stay with Ai. Ai discovers that despite her cute image, Akari is a perverted twelve-year-old fangirl who likes yuri. She wakes up the next morning to find that Akari has melted her coffeepot. Ai needs to ask someone's advice about Akari, so she calls Yuji and asks him to meet her; Yuji does, on the condition that she buy expensive breakfast for him.

They go inside a restaurant called Labyrinthus Obscuri and get strudel and coffee. While talking, Ai notices that the entire restaurant has become empty and tries to get Yuji to leave with her, but a girl from Yuji's past appears before him and addresses him, saying she's decided to forgive him. Yuji introduces her to Ai as Amniya, his first crush. They do some [[reminiscing about the past]]. Ai realizes that they're inside a reality bubble and confronts Amniya, saying that she herself is the only person she knows of who can create a [[reality bubble 1]]. Ai pops the bubble and at the same time receives a bunch of information from Amniya's mind. Ai explains that "Amniya" is actually Rebecca, daughter of Arishil, princess of Fung, and that she was trying to confuse Yuji using Ai's powers — Ai reveals for the first time that she is an esper. 

Yuji tells Ai that he and Amniya were neighbors when he was younger, and had sex. Amniya's brother tried to kill him, but his powers activated and he killed Jared instead. After that, Amniya couldn't stand to see him anymore and they never spoke again. 

Ai explains again that Rebecca came from the [[Outer Rim]] and works for Princess Arishil, who is also called [[/Irzratul/, The Shining]], and is a member of The Sixteen, Arishil's private elite guard. Arishil and Rebecca are a race with powerful magic. 

Yuji wants to go the Outer Rim where they live and ask what they want with him, but Ai thinks it's a bad idea; she offers to go herself or go with Mariko, but Yuji won't hear of it and says he won't go. He makes Ai pay for breakfast while he goes outside; when Ai comes out, she sees him sitting with Mariko and talking about something. (IIRC, Mariko confessed her love to him just now.) The three part, with Yuji going home to sleep. 

*** reminiscing about the past
This is written just like one of the examples in /How Not to Write A Novel/. Edit.

*** reality bubble 1
In some of my other notes they are called Enochian Areas; I think I prefer Enochian Field or Enochian Zone.

*** /Irzratul/, The Shining
I really like how that word sounds. If I do continue with this, I want to do a little more work on Rhokhosi and develop it into a more usable language. (Not at the level of Quenya, though; more like a naming language with a few phrases you can form from the available words and grammar.) 

*** Outer Rim
Get rid of it. Just give the islands names. This name is a holdover from my older conception where they had a weird flat Earth or the entire world was all on one side and the Outer Rim was at the edge between the Grand Zone (real world) and fantasy world. 

** episode 7 - Crawling Baby Human
*** Summary
/Elf Balm/'s Jinjo and Mirufa watch Yuji and Ai leave the restaurant together and follow them, cornering them on the train platform and forcing Yuji to hear them out. Yuji brings them to his house, where they tell him he's the Irlumarmitpa; they won't tell him what this actually means, but say he must come with them to see Arishil. Yuji refuses under those circumstances and Jinjo attacks him; Yuji manages to win, but Mirufa jumps in and forces Ai to throw a reality bubble and stop everything. Yuji tells her to get rid of them but then randomly changes his tune and says he'll come to the Outer Rim as long as Ai is with him to make sure he can't be trapped or killed.

They ride a train to the Outer Rim, at which time Yuji tells Ai that Mariko came to ask him to date her. Yuji said he would think about it. They take a car to the Irpazm Tree, the big tree where Arishil and her people live. Arishil explains that he is the prophesized human with the ability to replenish her race and he must mate with her. Yuji refuses to stay despite Arishil's tempting offer, but Arishil asks that he think more about it and requests that he attend [[the ball]] in Nandul, Sakura Memorial for Gottslehrer Academy, a private school run by the royal family of Montagria. After they leave, Rebecca tells Arishil that she has a way to break the reality bubble. 

Back home, Yuji and Ai part. Minutes later, Mariko runs up to Ai in a panic.

*** Opinion
Some of the individual passages need editing and revision, but mostly, the content of this episode isn't that bad. It had a reasonable amount of content for its length — just one mostly pointless passage, in the train.

*** the ball
Except I don't know about this ball. I have to read episode 9 again but I don't really remember the whole ball story making any sense, and also I don't remember the lead-in to the story about Yuji getting the card back so he can go to the ball making any sense. We'll see.

** episode 8 - So You Walked Back in the Revolving Door and Did It Over Again
(Note: Changing the title because musical lyrics don't work like quoting another author — they get all bitchy.)
*** Summary
Yumiko tries to commit suicide and fails. Her mother's current boyfriend is the prime suspect. When she wakes up and Mariko asks why she tried to kill herself, she says it's because she couldn't find the handbag they wanted. 

Yuji goes home to drink but receives a call from Akari to come to the hospital. He does, and Yumiko asks to talk to him alone. She claims she returned to prostitution and ended up having an abortion, which Yuji says is a lie, then claims to love him. According to her medical charts she was drunk. 

Yuji goes into the hall with the others and tells them what she said; Mariko refuses to believe it, and Ai says they should try looking for evidence to back up something she said. They go down to the cafeteria and Mariko tells Yuji that Yumiko has been under a lot of stress because she's afraid of screwing up her relationship with Akari by acting like their mother did when she was young.

Akari goes home to get clothes for Yumiko and finds a football pin from the school behind the bed, similar to one that Allen found when he discovered that Jolie was cheating on him. She also finds a men's sock. 

Yuji and Ai walk home and talk about what's been happening. Ai mentions [[Yithion, who doesn't exist anymore]]. She admits she was scared of Yumiko and that she doesn't feel like she has what it takes to deal with any of what's going on, including the situation with Arishil. She asks Yuji if he's going to date Mariko and Yuji mocks her for being a little girl with a head full of dating and kissing. After they part, Yuji thinks that he'll convince Arishil at the ball that he's not the person she thinks he is.

Allen yells at Yuji for turning down Mariko's offer to date, and Yuji distracts him by bringing up the ball. The teacher in their homeroom brings up three specialty academies, including Gottslehrer, the one holding the ball that Arishil wants Yuji to go to. The academy is located in Nandul, which is a grant of land across the river given to the Outer Rim residents to establish their own city. Arishil, Yuji notes, is actually the one holding the ball; the prince is merely providing the venue. 

After Health, the group has art together, and Yuji deduces that Ai is a fantasy nerd from her art style and her knowledge of linguistics. She admits later to having the desire to be a writer. Mariko arrives and says she's also going to the ball; shortly after, Akari appears for a date with Mariko and Ai and, when Yuji notes how unconcerned they seem about Yumiko, is told that they know what happened; Yumiko slept with a guy, and is now scarred. Yuji can't believe that that's all it is. Akari shows him the pin, and Yuji discovers they believe that Yumiko slept with Jaime Vasquez. At that moment, Allen appears, and Yuji asks him to tell them how Akari got the pin. Yuji surmises that Yumiko, in a moment of weakness and drunkenness, invited Allen over and slept with him. Yuji, determined to get to the bottom of things, brings the others to Yumiko's house to see her.

They find Yumiko in the kitchen, drunk and on acid, talking to the refrigerator about her abortion of their child. Yuji calls the police, who arrest her and take her to the drunk tank. Yuji tells the police they were just able to protect the younger girls, but he thinks she had rape in mind. After the police leave, Allen tells them that she called him suddenly and told him to come over and they'd have sex. In the middle, Yumiko's mother came back from bailing out her boyfriend, and Yumiko threw him out the window naked, then threw his clothes out after him, forgetting one sock and the pin. 

[[Ai starts deducing]]. Akari tells her that their mother broke up with her boyfriend after he went to jail, and Ai says she thinks it was a different boyfriend. Ai thinks that Yumiko's suicide attempt must have been right after the failed attempt to have sex with Allen, when her emotions would have been high and passionate. Since Yumiko called Allen in around eleven, Ai finds it implausible that her mother actually came back, since she doesn't believe that a party-hardy woman would be awake at that time. Mariko gets angry at her, but Yuji tells Mariko not to blame Ai and Ai finishes by saying that she thinks the mother's other boyfriend was the cause of Yumiko's suicide attempt and that he was somehow responsible for the suspected abortion. Ai thinks that she did it on purpose, knowing that it would make Yumiko commit suicide.  Mariko asks why she would purposely do such a thing and Yuji suggests that she didn't want to be a parent anymore and may have figured Akari had left for good. 

The four (Yuji, Allen, Akari, and Ai) go inside to look for evidence to support this theory, any evidence of a different boyfriend. They find a tiger-striped handbag in Yumiko's closet, and also evidence that her mother has expensive gifts which the other boyfriend couldn't afford. Yuji looks at Akari's cell phone, which he still has after borrowing it to call the police, and notices calls from Kazuko Matsutaki and Eutsler M. They show the evidence to Mariko, who poo-poos the handbags, says Yumiko did do something like get impregnated by some old guy, and says Kazuko Matsutaki is their mother and [[she doesn't know Eutsler M]]. Mariko explains that [[Kazuko needs to have her children to get the money]], which is how she persuaded Kazuko to get Yumiko out of jail. Ai asks if it's okay to have just Akari, and Mariko says she reckons it is. Mariko tries to convince them to give up the search, but Ai begs for a few more minutes and Mariko reluctantly consents, although she doesn't think they'll find anything. 

Yuji thinks that he likes this side of Ai. Ai gathers everyone in the [[laundry room (?)]]. Ai sums everything up. She thought the tiger-striped handbag was real because it appeared in two of Yumiko's stories. She also thinks that it's unlikely that the carioca boyfriend had anything to do with it. Ai thinks that someone intentionally brought the man who impregnated Yumiko a year ago back into the picture, to mess with her head. Ai says she first thought it was Kazuko, but now they they've been searching, she [[has a different suspect — Akari]]. Ai thinks the whole thing was a revenge plot against Yumiko by Akari, who was mad that [[Yumiko screamed and threw money at her]]. 

Akari doesn't quite confess, though she basically leaves no room for doubt. Ai leaves it up to Yuji's judgment to decide what to do with her, and Yuji decides to do nothing, thinking this was probably what Ai wanted, but didn't have the courage to propose. They tell Mariko the whole thing was a waste of time just like she said. Kazuko drives up, and Akari jumps into her arms, crying about how scared she was of Yumiko. Kazuko promises to protect her and they both cry.

Yuji and Ai decide they'll go the ball together.

*** Yithion, who doesn't exist anymore
He is now Polyphemus. He's stupid and he's named after the stupid cyclops who gets tricked by Odysseus into yelling that Nobdy's attacking him. 

*** she doesn't know Eutsler M
even though she clearly does know him later, in episode 12. In other notes I wrote that he was going by Macon Eutsler at the time Mariko was in his gang before. So, continuity error. 

*** Kazuko needs to have her children to get the money
which doesn't fit with what I wrote later OR earlier — earlier I said the money was part of a divorce settlement with Yumiko and Akari's father, while later I said it was Eutsler's gift to her for ratting on their father. In either case, she doesn't need to have her children or keep the name Kanzaki in order to keep the tap on. 

*** Ai starts deducing
The latter part of this episode, where Ai is deducing, is way too damned convoluted. I wrote it, and I can't even figure out what the hell is supposed to be going on or where Ai is getting some of these leaps of inference she's taking. 

*** laundry room (?)
I can't figure out which room they're supposed to be in. In fact, half the time I haven't got the slightest idea where they're supposed to be.  

*** has a different suspect — Akari
I don't know if I like the psycho Akari. For one thing, she already did a 180 from a cute nymphette girl to a crazed otaku. Now she's a psycho with a split personality who orchestrated a totally impossible revenge scheme. Plus if she's going to be in Strawberry Sunflower (in her younger days, granted — though she's supposed to be twelve here and is supposed to be twelve or thirteen in StrawSun, so yet another inconsistency) I don't want her to be psycho. 

*** Yumiko screamed and threw money at her
If I'm reading this correctly, only one day has passed since then — after the money-throwing incident, Akari went to stay with Ai. The next morning, Ai went to meet Yuji, and episodes 6 and 7 happened — they were ambushed by Rebecca in the cafe, then Mirufa and Jinjo confronted them, and at the end of the day, Mariko came and found Ai on the train platform. 

NOPE, WRONG — at least two days have passed. Allen and Yuji talk about the Angel Strike job at school the next day. Akari found the pin on the same day, and showed them the next day, and they went straight from school to the house where all this erupted. So it's been two days. But it was only one day for Akari to organize it — the whole plot would have had to be orchestrated and carried out during the several hours while Yuji and Ai were at the cafe, because Yumiko's suicide attempt was at eleven that day and if I recall correctly, Ai left her house around 6:00. (There's considerable doubt in the narrative that that was the correct time, though.) So Akari didn't really have enough time to do all of this. Unless she had something set up beforehand, which is highly implausible since we're talking about the crime boss Eutsler, who wouldn't be at the beck and call of a twelve-year-old girl and daughter of his former nemesis. So this whole finale is stupid. 

** episode 9 - Thug Life
*** Summary
Note: the continuity in this episode is all jumbled up. Which was a cool idea, except that these fricking chapters are already so jumbled, shuffled, and confusing that I shudder to think what the final plot is going to look like. Probably like someone ate a Lego house and vomited it back up. 

Anyway, it opens with Yuji spying on the prince bringing a girl onto the balcony so he can talk her into having sex with him. Yuji is in the back alley and knows he's being followed, which is why he came into the back alley. 

He gets surrounded by a male Shirley Temple with a switchblade and a guy in a server's uniform. He notices that the girl on the balcony unmistakably has strawberry blonde hair and is wearing the same dress Ai was wearing (and is therefore her, in case that wasn't clear). 

Next, the story backtracks to Yuji and Allen at the arcade, discussing Akari's living situation and the ball. Yuji won't tell Allen why he's going to the ball until the ball is over but tells Allen not to worry since there'll be chicks there. It turns out they're at the arcade on a mission; one of the teachers's son lost a card which is very rare and valuable, and to get a ride to the ball, [[Yuji has to get the card back]]. Allen reenacts a scene from Pulp Fiction, only with manga instead of McDonald's hamburgers. 

After a ridiculous story from Allen about feeling up a girl in PE, Yuji sees their target, Hans, the guy who tried to rape Ai in epsiode 4, and his two cronies, Adam (small and ratlike) and Big Yellow (even bigger than Hans). Hans loses at a video game and accuses a random kid of cheating somehow. Allen rescues the kid by making a deal with Hans to trade a Rex Iocundi (the Yugioh-like game with Manreeki the Unforgiving One)  card in return for not getting beat up. The kid, rather than being grateful, is mad at Allen. As Hans leaves, he mentions going to Club Shuffle. 

Yuji and Allen follow Hans and his cronies to the club, which is in the Neon District, the bad part of town. A greaseball meets them at the door and takes money for admission and the use of loaner decks to play cards (the club also advertises drinks and girls). Allen proceeds to pick a fight with Hans, which is interrupted by the maitre'd, a not-French not-Chinese wannabe mob boss (who later [[turns out to be Macon Eutsler]], the crime boss). Eutsler insists that if they have a conflict, they solve it by dueling. Allen takes on Hans with a borrowed deck, and candidly admits to Yuji that the game is mostly about luck and how much you can afford to spend on booster packs, meaning there's no chance at all that he'll win with a loaner deck. 

Allen is driving the four of them (Mariko, Ai, Yuji, and himself) to the ball in a minivan, and is a terrible driver. They arrive and are met in the parking lot by a man in a white suit who is Yuji's personal servant for the night. Mariko admires Ai's and Yuji's formal wear in the parking lot, and they go inside. Mirufa comes down to bring Yuji and Ai up to meet Arishil, leaving Jinjo to talk to Mariko. Allen goes off to seduce rich girls while Mariko stays behind to talk to Jinjo, who tells her that she can train in nyvamna abilities at the school, unlike in a normal school, and that the only way she'll be able to keep seeing Yuji is if she comes, and that Ai is just a nuisance to them who won't be one much longer. After Jinjo leaves, Mariko meets Ayame and her sister Ayane, who also mention a third sister, Ayumi; these are the Koroleva triplets from the second and third drafts. Ayame, rather than worshipping Satan, is just an annoying trendy goth girl who has a lesbian crush on Jinjo. Ayane is about to lead Ayame away so they can meet the prince, but he appears, and Mariko laughs at how much he looks like Elvis (but on the inside). Mirufa brings Ai and Yuji back down the stairs, and introduces them to Prince Van, who calls Ai 'Lady Nembris' and says it's good to see her again. Ai says he has the wrong person. The prince takes her off somewhere to talk. 

Mariko and Yuji talk. Yuji won't tell her what he talked about with Arishil, but he does consent to dance with her, though he first goes off to use the bathroom. Mariko sees the prince taking Ai off somewhere private and follows them so she can intervene if Ai needs any help. On the way, she hears someone talking on a walkie-talkie in the closet and recognizes the voice as Miba. Mariko follows him out into the alleyway, where she finds Miba and Shirley Temple cornering Yuji. She attacks Miba from behind, which allows Yuji to concentrate on Shirley Temple and overcome him. 

Ai enters Club Shuffle and asks to see Woraco. She tells Woraco that she's Ai Maeda, alias Aya Alexandros, alias Nembris Linturi, and that they've met before (when she was younger). Woraco remembers and says she must have come to fight him openly and he knows he can't win, but he'll do what he can. Ai says she didn't come to fight; she came to defect. She says her father sent her on a mission, one which Xenophon might not be able to carry out and for which her sex gave her certain advantages. Woraco tells her to come to the main hall, as there's a disturbance she may like to see. She sees Allen and Yuji playing against Hans, who she recognizes from the other night. Allen loses and Hans does a dance. Woraco says they're here as part of a plot by Montagria and refers to Eutsler as Richard. When Yuji says they need the card, despite the result of the match, Hans says he'll do Yuji's sister (which he's been saying to everyone) and Yuji, thinking of Shoko doing enjou kousai, gets angry and overturns the table and attacks Hans, beating up the doorman and both of Hans's henchmen. Hans tries to use a God card against Yuji but Yuji rips it in half and Hans gives him the card they need. 

On the balcony above, Woraco tells Ai he thinks they can make a deal but she might have to obey the orders of his superiors and could lose the very thing she wanted to save. Ai says she's okay with that.

Yuji brings the card to Mr. Tanaka, the teacher whose son lost it. Yuji sees a picture of the son and comments on how old he is. 

After overcoming Shirley Temple and Miba, interrogates Shirley Temple with extreme prejudice. He tells them he wasn't sent by Arishil and the previous incident with Miba had nothing to do with this. They hear Van on the balcony ask Ai to marry him. Miba wakes up and interrupts, but he sees Ai on the balcony and tells [[Zakinthos]] that this changes everything and his uncle will be very unhappy if Zakinthos screws up his plans. Although puzzled, Mariko forces Yuji to dance with her and keep his promise. 

*** Yuji has to get the card back
which makes no sense; since Arishil is rich and wants him at the ball, she'd damn well better go out of her way to get him to the ball. On the other hand, although the motivation is nonsensical, I like this chapter. It's much better than I expected, probably because I actually planned it out. (In fact, IIRC, it was the difficulty of doing a nonlinear story that first made me plan out anything.) 

*** turns out to be Macon Eutsler
His depiction here is absolutely ridiculous ("What? Repeat yourself, please. I'm rather far away and can't hear well if you mumble.") But, I seem to remember him being pretty ridiculous in episode 12 too. 

*** Zakinthos
who doesn't exist anymore. He's now Jason, see Draft 5. Also, Hayro Miba is now Theseus. 
    
** episode 10 - Le Coeur a Raison que la Raison ne Connaît point
Note: I think this episode, in any rewritten version, needs to have more of a [[lead-in]]. Like, another chapter that at the very least 
  1. Introduces Glenco
  2. Shows Mariko and Yuji start to go out
  3. Shows more of Sishica and Rekka.
*** Summary
Yuji and Mariko are sitting at the shore of Lake Hybrea and discussing what's happening. Akari has moved back in with Ai, and Allen has found a new girlfriend who works at a daycare center. (He met her at the ball.) Allen asked Yuji to volunteer for an event that the youth center is putting on in the Outer Rim for underprivileged children. Mariko suggests that they volunteer so they can stay in a nice hotel for a while and put community service on their college applications. They then discuss Ai and the prince, and whether or not she'll go for his offer to marry her. Yuji then asks Mariko why she's going out with him when he's such a boring sourpuss, and Mariko says "Le coeur a raison que la raison ne connaît point."

The night after the play, Yuji and Mariko are at a fancy restaurant at the hotel reminiscing about what happened during the play. Yuji again asks Mariko why she's going out with him and Mariko repeats the French phrase, but then asks why Yuji is going out with her, and Yuji says it's because Allen said it might be good for him and they might have fun together. Mariko gets drunk during the dinner and asks Yuji why he didn't go live with the princess. Yuji says it's because he thought he would be bored living the pampered life, and also because her henchmen rubbed him the wrong way. Mariko asks what Arishil said to him at the party and Yuji makes it sound like Ai isn't an esper and hesitates before telling her what Arishil told him. At that moment, Ishinobu appears with Kanako Ichihara, who wrote the play. Mariko insults Kanako's writing ability and Kanako runs away crying. 

Ishinobu tells them they'll be having a visit to the elf village tomorrow, and that Prince Van is coming, along with a reporter, to help highlight the horrible conditions in the village. Yuji asks her a few questions about the politics and elves and then she leaves, and Yuji and Mariko get the bill, which is outrageous. They leave a tip which is most definitely not 15% of the bill. Yuji brings the drunken Mariko up to her room, where she propositions him to have sex. Yuji but he doesn't take her seriously and lets her into her room and returns to his own room. He wakes up a few minutes after falling asleep, goes into Mariko's room, and kills her with a knife. 

The next morning, Mariko, still alive, asks what's wrong with him. They're in a van on rental from the hotel along with everyone else: Sishica and Rekka, Arishil's children; Ai, Akari, Allen, and Ishinobu; and Prince Van, a journalist, and a bodyguard. They also have a driver, one of the maids from the hotel, Hanami. Yuji tells Mariko he dreamed about killing her and that it's not the first such dream he's had; when he mentions that he dreamed of killing Arishil, Rekka scoffs and starts insulting everyone, getting into a fight with Mariko. 

The maid, Hanami, drives them to a perimeter fence where she speaks with a guard, who lets them in as soon as he sees Prince Van in the van (ha!). The elven village is dirty and full of garbage, to the great shame of the village headman, who doesn't want to let them see. Rekka starts a conversation with the headman while Mariko and Yuji ask Sishica questions; Sishica explains that in the distant past, elves ruled the islands, but his people overthrew them and put the humans in control. The elves' advanced technology ended up being largely lost, and they were locked up by the Montagrians out of fear. 

Mariko tries to engage Hanami in conversation while Sishica tells Yuji that the headman's wife says they've lost several children from the village of late and that she believes they were kidnapped and killed to make folk remedies by humans. She asks if he'll investigate, but Yuji won't, although Mariko tries to convince him to agree to it. Akari then comes up and tells them the same thing, saying she wants to help and revealing that she's also a nyvamna. She tells them she has the power to break Enochian fields.

*** lead-in
This chapter ought to take place before the play. The dinner at the beginning can be before the play instead of after. Alternately, it can be how it is, but with a longer lead-in to the battle with Glenco in the next chapter. 
** episode 11 - Virga pro Virginibus Rationes Habet quas Illa Ratio perfecte Intellegit
*** Summary
Yuji goes into Ai's room at night and kills her with a knife. He starts back to his own room, but on the way sees light from another room and looks through the keyhole. He sees Ai having sex with the prince  through the keyhole and starts to admire her body and become aroused, but is interrupted when Ai, fully clothed, comes up behind him and says his name. She says someone was in her room but ran when she woke up. She thinks it might have been one of the poachers who's been attacking the elven village. Yuji agrees to help her chase after the intruder and try to catch him. They follow him out the back of the hotel into an alley; Yuji and Ai get separated and Yuji is attacked by someone. He is saved by Hanami, the maid, who chases off the attacker, but tells Yuji that they won't run because they want to fight. She leads him to the end of the alley, where they run into a group of five teenagers who are multicultural and stereotypical. They introduce themselves as Glenco and claim they own [[the charity racket in this town]], and won't let it be stolen from them by Yuji and his friends. 

Hanami is about to fight them, but Ai appears and orders her not to fight, speaking some Elmian words to reprogram her to make her follow Ai's orders. Glenco admit they're artificial beings. Yuji is about to fight them, but he feels a stabbing pain in his head and collapses. 

He wakes up to find Sishica shaking him. Sishica wanted to have tea with him and so came to wake him up. Yuji thinks that Sishica is just like Akari and asks if he's really a pansy or if it's an act. Sishica says it's not an act; he doesn't want to make a mistake. Sishica then asks Yuji about his father. He tells Yuji that his people are eusocial: only the queen and princesses can have children, but they can produce children of their own species from fathers of any species, since they can adapt their own biology to suit the biology of the father's species. Because of this, Sishica doesn't know who his father is, and he wants to ask Yuji what having a father is like. Yuji says his father was a good father, and thinks about Yumiko and Akari's father. Sishica says if Yuji became the Irlumarmitpa, he would be like a father to them all. He tells Yuji that the prophecy says that if a woman of his species bears the child of the Irlumarmitpa, it will begin the next stage of their evolution. Sishica doesn't know what to believe among the many theories of how the Irlumarmitpa will save the species, but thinks that Yuji should do it, because he'd rather see something happen than nothing. Yuji says it isn't going to happen. 

Sishica asks if Yuji will come somewhere with him. He brings Yuji down to the basement, then abandons Yuji, his final words being a request to consider coming and living with them. Yuji hears the prince's voice coming down the stairs and hides in a laundry cart. He sees the prince come in with Ai. The prince says that Ai came to his room and had sex last night, and now they must get married according to the laws of Montagria. Ai says she didn't do it, and the prince accuses her of lying and is about to hit her, but doesn't and leaves the room. Ai leaves a bit later. Yuji then leaves to tell the prince to find Hanami, who can corroborate Ai's story about where she was last night. He goes to the prince's room and hears the prince and his two cohorts talking from outside the door. The prince says that he brought in Glenco. His plan is to let Glenco trap someone and agree to save them only if Ai will marry him. The journalist says "the youngest girl" would make a good target, and Yuji, assuming he means Akari, goes to warn her.

Akari isn't in her room. The receptionist tells him that she saw Akari with Sishica going into town. In the parking lot, Yuji meets Hanami, who tells him that Akari left an hour ago with Sishica. He tells Hanami what's going on, and Hanami says the easiest way to solve things would be to kill Van. Yuji scoffs at that idea, and Hanami says that she now serves him and will do as he says, since Ai reprogrammed her to serve him. They go back inside and find a note from Glenco at the front desk, a ransom note saying they've kidnapped Akari and Sishica. Yuji finds the whole situation completely ludicrous (and so did I, when I read their note again). He's angry because Van's insidious plot is working out. Hanami says the solution is simple: if he himself asks for Van's help, it won't be Ai who incurs the debt to be repaid by marriage, but rather Yuji. And clearly, Yuji can't give Ai to repay a debt since he's not her father or guardian, so Van's plot will fail. Unfortunately, he's too late, and Ai has already asked the prince. 

Yuji, Mariko, Hanami, the prince, and the prince's henchmen set off to fight Glenco at the elven village. Hanami plans a surprise attack, but the prince ruins their plan by charging in headfirst, and a fight breaks out. They're losing, but Yuji gets knocked into a hut and activates a piece of hidden elven technology and starts to beat them up. The elves are angry because Yuji has revealed to the prince that they have weapons hidden in their village. The prince offers to knight Yuji, but Yuji refuses the "honor" and makes it known that he's seen the prince mistreating Ai and she doensn't want to marry him. Despite his anger, the prince lets him go, since he's afraid of the elven weapon that Yuji was able to activate. 

Back at the hotel, Ai is running away. Rekka comes to see her and says Arishil ordered Sishica to give himself up to Glenco as part of a plan to get Ai to marry Van and get her out of the way. Rekka says she transformed herself into Ai and had sex with the prince last night, to trick him into thinking he had a legal right to her under his people's laws. She says Sishica wanted to use a different plan, to persuade Yuji with kindness, but Rekka admits they can't do it because they're too used to living from scheme to scheme. 

On the ride back from the village, Yuji tells Mariko that Arishil warned him at the party to stay away from Ai, because Ai is trying to kill him. He tells Mariko that Ai is an esper, an extremely powerful one. Mariko says it doesn't matter, he needs to trust his friend. Yuji is satisfied because that's what he wanted to hear. 

*** the charity racket in this town
Part of what I always found so offputting about this setup is that Glenco is so American, and yet they're in fantasy land claiming to own the charity racket in fantasy land. I think maybe if I can find some way to introduce them in Sakura Memorial and have then show up here in fantasy land later (to steal elf children to finance their nefarious escapades) I'd feel better about it. Or do something completely different. 

Basically, I like a lot of the individual events that happen in these chapters (from episode 9 to 13), but I don't find their motivations to be convincing or logical. In a rewrite, I'd like to mostly reuse them but find ways to motivate them which make more sense. 
** episode 12 - Do Robots Shave with Electric Razors?
*** Summary
Allen has broken up with Ishinobu and is depressed about it. He quickly recovers when he discovers that Hanami has moved in and starts asking her about naughty functionality. 

They see a report on the news that Glenco has invaded an apartment building and killed everyone inside.  Yuji receives a phone call from Mariko, who wants to go after Glenco, or at least tell the police that they're robots. Yuji refuses to do either, and Mariko, angry, hangs up. Allen overhears and asks how Yuji could go off and fight robots without him, angering Yuji and causing him to throw Allen out. 

Yumiko has returned from jail and is trying to be nice to Akari; she made a nice breakfast and asks Akari about her week. Yumiko hears Akari calling her /whore/ and /slut/ under her breath, but doesn't say anything (IIRC, Yumiko isn't certain Akari is really saying it and thinks it might be in her head). Yumiko leaves for work, but stops on the front step to answer a call from Mariko, who tells her that Yuji refused to help and she can't get Ai on the phone. Mariko asks why Eutsler wants her back now, and Yumiko says their father was a lawyer who was running for District Attorney and had evidence that would put Eutsler away. Eutsler tried to pacify him with bribes and threats, but it didn't work, so Eutsler killed him, with help from his wife, Yumiko's mother, who was having an affair with Eutsler. 

Yumiko says that Mariko [[took care of Kyoko and Kirino]], but Eutsler hasn't given up, which is why he brought Glenco in. Yumiko is desperate and is worried that Eutsler knows Akari is with Kyoko and has the goal of capturing her; she tells Mariko if Mariko can't convince Yuji and Ai to help, she'll go back to Eutsler in return for a promise to leave Akari alone. 

Yuji is at home brooding, drunk, and trying to justify his refusal to fight. Ai comes over and apologizes for ignoring his and Mariko's calls. Ai then brings up the prince and tells Yuji what happened in the laundry room at the hotel. When Yuji asks why she didn't just use a reality bubble to kill the prince, Ai asks if that's why he didn't try to help her when he saw them, turning the tables on Yuji and making him feel guilty. Yuji assures her that he would have helped her if things had gotten bad, that he wouldn't have let her be hurt, and then says he believes her that she didn't have sex with the prince, but he did see someone who looked like her having sex with the prince. Ai tells him it was Rekka and that Sishica gave himself up on purpose as part of Arishil's plan. She also hypothesizes that Akari might have done the same. Yuji asks why Ai didn't turn down the prince more forcefully from the beginning, and Ai tells him that her father and brothers work for the CIA (to Yuji's non-surprise) and that the prince is one of the regional allies of the CIA and the US, who provides them with elven technology. A while ago, he asked them to provide a nyvamna wife so he could breed powers into his bloodline, and when he saw Ai in their personnel books he became smitten with her. Because of this, she was under some pressure to accept the prince's marriage offer, but she didn't want to and so kept him at bay for a while. 

Yuji tries to defend Akari, saying even if she's an evil genius, he can't see what she would have to gain by giving herself to Glenco. Akari appears at the door and says she hadn't planned to give herself up, but it was a convenient way to get them to fight Glenco. She tells them she knows who's commanding Glenco and says that after Yumiko went outside, she cracked the door and overheard Yumiko's conversation with Mariko. Using her photographic (or phonographic, in this case) memory, she recites the entire conversation word for word with screenplay directions. 

Yuji sums everything up — Eutsler, the same person that Akari brought in to [[drive Yumiko to suicide]], hired Glenco to get her back. Ai tells him that Eutsler is the maitre'd from the card club. Yuji says this doesn't change anything and he still isn't going to fight Glenco, even after Ai says she'll use her powers to destroy Glenco since they're just machines. He recommends that Akari and Yumiko go back to their grandfather and run away from Eutsler instead of towards him. When Ai says she can't do anything alone, Yuji says Mariko will help, but he won't. Both Akari and Ai express disappointment with him as they leave, with Ai saying "So you're just going to hide in the laundry cart again." 

This affects him surprisingly deeply, because he realizes he was lying when he said he would have left the laundry cart to help her and she knows it. He tries to make himself feel better about the whole thing by thinking that Ai really doesn't need his help because she's Superman combined with Batman, while he is, at best, Robin combined with Robin. Yuji's father comes in and tells Yuji that he knows about Glenco; he says Glenco was made by an American company to write health textbooks, using elven technology recovered by the CIA from Montagria. Yuji's father uses a phrase from Alice in Wonderland to activate Yuji's programming, and then tells him about how he used his powers to beat up a gang when he was twelve. Hiro explains that all nyvamna are really espers, like Ai, with the power to create reality bubbles, but they convince themselves that they can only create certain effects and it becomes reality. Yuji was able to push bullets away, predict his foes' moves in advance, and use air-dancing. Hiro reminds him of the training he did to learn how to push bullets aside.

Yumiko calls, and tells Yuji that Mariko, Ai, and Akari went to Eutsler's hideout at the card club and are now in his grasp; Glenco has taken out the police and there's no help. Yuji says he has an idea.

Ai is tied up on the balcony where Eutsler's throne is, surrounded by Glenco. Yuji and Yumiko, going with Ai's hope for rescue, come in. Ai thinks about how stupid she was; at the last minute, she lost her nerve and thought about how Glenco seem to be sentient, even if they're machines, and how she couldn't kill a sentient being just because it was a machine. 

Eutsler is going to let Glenco kill Yuji; he is going to take Yumiko and Akari as his prize, and let the people in the club rape Mariko and Ai. Yuji leaps into action, freeing himself and the others at the same time that Hanami enters from the roof. Eutsler runs away, leaving them to fight Glenco. 

It turns out that Yuji got the police in on it; Allen sneaked in and summoned them as soon as the fight started, and their job was to arrest Eutsler (and whoever else they can). Allen explains to Yumiko and Ai from behind cover while Yuji, Mariko, Akari, and Hanami fight Glenco. They manage to disable Gurpreet Singh, Morqueeshah Stiles, Thuan Nguyen, and Jessica Thompson, but Yuji is nearly defeated by Michael Kennedy. Then Ai comes in and freezes everything in a reality bubble. She walks around to each Glenco member, showing the crimes the committed in the name of health, and destroys them each in turn. Then she teleports everyone away, into the park, so they don't have to deal with the police outside. 

*** took care of Kyoko and Kirino
I want to make this part of the Mariko arc in the new draft, so it won't have happened yet. It's the story from the game where Kyoko, Mariko's old gang boss who Mariko beat up and put in a wheelchair when she left the gang, and Kyoko's sister Kirino, attack Mariko to get revenge and Yuji helps her defeat them. In the true ending of the Mariko arc of the game, it leads to a falling out between Mariko and Yuji because Mariko is forced to become a killer, which she never wanted. In the new draft, I want this falling out to presage the events of the Ai story.
