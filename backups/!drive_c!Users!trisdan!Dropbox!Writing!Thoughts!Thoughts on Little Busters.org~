* Thoughts on Little Busters!, begun Friday, March 1st, 2013:
** Episodes 1–16
I wrote about the first episode of Little Busters as an Unfair First Impression, but after watching the second episode, I highly doubt it will be the last I watch, so I moved Little Busters to its own file.

Before I get into the good, I want to complain a little: I'm not very satisfied with the voice acting for the heroines who have appeared so far, Rin and Komari (the blonde girl Riki meets at the end of the first episode). At first I thought Rin might be voiced by Rie Kugimiya, but it's actually a voice actress I've never heard of, who also played Rin in the visual novel. Komari is played by Natsumi Yanase, who also played Chihiro in ef: A Tale of Memories. I'll be blunt; both of their voices are kind of annoying. It kind of fits Rin's image from the first episode to have a voice that's a little bit shrill, though in this episode she shows a different side that I hope the actress can handle later on when she does more speaking while acting like this. Natsumi Yanase has sort of a nasal, snivelly note to her voice that's actually less annoying when she's playing Komari than when she played Chihiro, since Chihiro spent half of her time sounding like she was on the edge of tears and playing up that side. Nonetheless, it's still sort of annoying, and I also think her voice is too deep to fit Komari, though that depth is also a little bit interesting.

Anyway, that was my complaint. Otherwise, I loved the second episode; it brought me back to the early days of Clannad, which I would unhesitatingly list among my top five favorite anime ever (as I've said before). It begins with Komari Kamikita and Riki continuing their meeting on the roof; Komari thinks that Riki is a teacher coming to yell at her, but he tells her he's not (she's afraid the teacher can impersonate him using ventriloquism too). She says the roof is her secret place and shares her stash of sweets with Riki, telling him she loves sweets and is made happy by them. Before Riki leaves, Komari says she's glad they were able to talk, because they're in the same class, but have never spoken before.

Later, Riki is sitting in class and listening to the girls complain that Rin is shirking her duties and probably playing with her cats. It seems the other girls think Rin is stuck-up because she's popular among boys, though it isn't clear if they just mean Kengo and Masato (no one ever seems to remember that Riki hangs out with the group; Kyousuke is Rin's brother, and while I would love it if Rin was an oniichan-ko, she's actually the main heroine of the game and a romantic interest of Riki, so she isn't an oniichan-ko). Riki goes and finds Rin, playing with her cats as predicted, and warns her that she'd better find some female friends for times when the guys aren't around. Rin gets angry and says that the girl behind her is her friend, but this claim is weakened when she can't remember the girl's name. She then finds a note tied to a cat that says something like "This is a secret to the world. Complete the tasks to find out." and instructs her to clean the storage room of the boys' dorm as her first task. Riki doesn't think it's a good idea to do it, but Rin can't resist and ends up doing it, dragging Riki, Kyousuke, and Masato along with her. While they clean, Komari shows up and tells them that she'd like to play baseball with them. (She seems to think that oven mitts are necessary for baseball.) Rin suddenly freaks out and tries to run away when Komari appears, and Riki tells her that Rin gets shy around strangers, revealing a new, ridiculously adorable side of Rin. Komari, however, really wants to be friends with Rin, and chases her around the whole time. When Rin tears her skirt, Komari even pulls out a sewing kit and fixes it for her, while Rin twitches and looks anywhere but at Komari.

When the group finishes cleaning, they decide to test Komari. The aim is to politely turn her away, since she revealed to Riki earlier that she thinks playing "field baseball" means that a dandelion is the first baseman. Kyousuke goes first, asking her what one needs to play baseball, and Komari, with a series of cool poses, says that "Guts, Courage, Friendship!" are required, moving Kyousuke's love for cheesy speeches and causing him to immediately pass her. She fails every athletic test—she can't lift the metal bat, so they give her a plastic one; she trips and falls on her face running around the bases; and when they toss a grounder to her, she hides her face with the glove and misses it. However, at the end of everything, Kyousuke asks her again what one needs to play baseball, and she once again responds with "Guts, Courage, Friendship!", and Kyousuke lets her on the team. 

Komari takes Rin by the hands and asks to be good friends, calling her "Rin-chan"; Rin freaks out and runs away, and Kyousuke says no one's ever called her "Rin-chan" before since all her friends are boys who don't use honorifics. Masato says he wants to be "Kinniku-chan" (Muscles-chan) and Rin throws her shoe at him, knocking him over, but crippling her ability to run away from Komari. Komari chases her, falling over halfway through, but Rin can't escape due to her missing shoe. At this point she actually hops back towards Komari and tries to thank Komari for fixing her skirt earlier. As all this is going on, Riki suddenly passes out from the narcolepsy that he warned us about earlier, saying that his connection to the world has been severed.

The first episode wasn't bad, but this was where the show really convinced me to give up on the solid but unspectacular Sakurasou no Petto na Kanojo. The first argument came near the beginning, when Komari discovers that she's stuck under the water tower and asks Riki to help pull her out. As Riki pulls, he notices that her skirt is coming up and he can see her underwear; he whispers "Anteater?" when he does, wondering what sort of creature is depicted on them. When Komari gets out, she confirms anteater, then gets embarrassed that he saw. So up to this point, pretty standard panty scene, right? Sakurasou no Petto na Kanojo did several on about the same level. In that show, though, one of two things would happen: the girl whose panties were seen would scream and slap Sorata, or it would be Mashiro and she would get more naked. Both pretty standard. Instead, Komari says that now she'll never get a bride. When Riki points out that that's backwards, Komari says she'll do her best to get a groom, then decides that it's best that Riki just pretend he never saw, and she'll pretend it was never seen. Not only was it fun, her final decision made some kind of sense even outside of anime.

The second argument came when we saw Rin playing with her cats. It was too adorable.

The third argument came when we saw Rin's shy side. That was additionally too adorable. You'd never guess from the first episode that she was like that, because she seemed so tough and Kyou-like, but it turns out that she's only that way around her friends and is actually socially awkward and weird around other people. That side of her is a bit like Fuko, who always seemed forward and energetic around Tomoya and Nagisa, but would get quiet and poker-faced around others.

But aside from the major arguments, the fun dialogue and character interaction permeates the whole episode and makes it enjoyable. So far, the comedy hasn't been quite as over-the-top as Clannad—nothing on the level of Fuko and Sunohara's carving contest--and it's been a bit more physical, like Angel Beats, but like Clannad and Kanon, the comedic situations always arise naturally from the characters' personalities. So far, my favorite character is Rin—of course, not all the heroines have appeared, but I have a feeling I'll like her quite a lot even if a real adorableness assassin comes along later. The scene when Riki finds her playing with her cats and tells her he's worried about her lack of female friends showed a tiny hint of their interaction, and it felt almost like classic Key; Riki is more gentle than Tomoya or Yuuichi, but he has the same feature of concern for other people and the ability to tell them about it. And like Clannad, I appreciate that Komari and Rin have a relationship as well. I'm sure they become good friends later on, just like the Clannad girls were all friends as much as they were rivals for Tomoya's affection (that was why Tomoyo always seemed like the odd one out—Nagisa, Kyou, and Kotomi were all good friends, and Fuko knew and liked all three of them, while Tomoyo pretty much knew only Sunohara and Tomoya). 

By the way, I was correct that Kyousuke was played by Hikaru Midorikawa, but unexpectedly, Riki is played by Yui Horie. I knew she could do it, after she played Mizuho in Otoboku, but it was a surprise. I kind of wish they would have found more well-known voice actresses for some of the girls, but at the same time, there can be a tendency to pigeonhole characters to voice actresses and cast according to actress, so that it seems like every show has the exact same cast (for example, Kami Nomi, Ore Imo, and Haganai use almost the same voice actresses—Ayana Taketatsu, Saori Hayami, Kana Hanazawa, all great, but not the only great actresses out there). For that reason, even if I'm not totally satisfied with Komari's and Rin's voices, I won't complain too much either, because I do appreciate the variety and the way that the casting distances them from possibly similar characters in other shows. (For the same reason, I'm glad that Rin wasn't played by Ryou Hirohashi and Komari wasn't played by Ai Nonaka or Mai Nakahara.) 

I was right that Itaru Hinoue and Na-Ga split the character designs, but actually, it was Na-Ga who designed Kudryavka, who I pegged as a Hinoue design, though I was correct that Hinoue designed Komari and Na-Ga designed Rin. While the school uniforms do look strangely non-uniform, the blending of the chubby-cheeked, soft and fluffy Hinoue designs with the more sleek, cool Na-Ga designs is sort of interesting, almost like the Clannad cast and the Angel Beats cast ended up at the same school somehow. 

Thoughts on Episodes 3, 4, and 5, Saturday, March 9th, 2013:

The cuteness continues in this latest round of episodes. In Episode 3, we meet Yuiko Kurugaya and Haruka Saigusa; Yuiko joins the Little Busters at the end of this episode, and Haruka seems to join later on. The first thing we find out about Yuiko is that she's a super-genius who doesn't come to class, so the first thing I thought was "Kotomi", but once she shows up, although she has a vague resemblance to Kotomi, her personality is quite different. She reminds me most of Yume Miru Kusuri's Mizuki Kirimiya (and her voice is the same) in that she's a sort of flippant rich girl; however, she also reminds me a bit of Haganai's Yozora Mikazuki (my favorite character from that show) in that she has a silly, weird side to her. She and Riki first encounter each other when Riki is trying to buy a drink from the vending machine just as class is about to restart; the machine is sold out, and Yuiko finds him and drags him to her secret spot, a small table hidden away in the hedges, where she has drinks. She tells him that she's bored with all this free time and she needs someone to entertain her, cajoling him to sit down. (She chose him because she likes cute things.) By the way, Yuiko likes to expose her rather nice cleavage by leaving the top buttons of her uniform undone, and she comes across as forceful, selfish, and capricious at first, which is the Mizuki side of her personality. Riki finally gives up and goes to sit down, but the chair he tries to sit in suddenly collapses under him. Yuiko says she just felt like doing that, revealing the Yozora side of her personality.

Later, Yuiko and Masato get in a fight somehow, and end up going by the usual rules: the rest of the kids in the cafeteria throw things at them, and they have to use whatever they catch as a weapon to defeat the other person. Masato gets soap, while Yuiko gets a model katana. Unlike his battles against Kengo, which are usually over immediately, Masato lasts for a minute against Yuiko, dodging her strikes and catching the blade. At the end she beats him up, but admits that she lost because she used her feet and fists for the last few strikes. At the end, Yuiko shows up at the field and says she's joining the Little Busters because she's bored; she seems pretty happy with the presence of Rin and Komari, although Rin tries to run away like always.

Episode 4 begins by introducing Kudryavka, who is as cute as promised. Her outfits are totally crazy and implausible, but she has an adorable appearance (I have a weakness for grey-haired lolis—even Azu-nyan was one in the K-On manga) and her voice is the cutest of the bunch so far. It seems she made out on her first day that she spoke much less Japanese than she really does, so to try and keep with her image, she uses English as much as possible. (Her accent is passable; she's actually Russian, though, so there's no reason to expect her to be good at English, though it is weird that she speaks it with a Japanese accent.) Riki helps her carry some boxes up to her dorm room and tells her to ask for help if she needs anything; Kudryavka seems to take an immediate liking to him. After the beginning, though, Episode 4 begins moving into what seems to be the Komari story. If Little Busters follows the same plot structure as Clannad—which it seems like it's going to—then we'll probably move through each heroine's story as the show progresses, ending with the main heroine, Rin. 

Rin discovers one day that one of her cats was hurt, but someone bandaged its wound with a pink band-aid with a picture of a chick on it. Haruka confirms that it was Komari, showing the same band-aid around her own finger. Rin nervously asks Riki to thank Komari and give her some candy; Riki goes up to the roof to find her and hears her talking in her sleep, saying "Onii-chan..." When Riki brings it up later, Komari tells him that she sometimes dreams about an older brother reading her a picture book, though she's an only child. The next day, Riki makes Rin come to the roof with him to see Komari, and Komari tells them that she found the book from her dream. It's a hand-drawn picture book about chicks and chickens, with the name "Kamikita Takuya" on the back. Komari tells them that she asked her mother about the name and her mother said there was no one with that name, but she could tell her mother was lying. Komari ends by asking Rin and Riki to come with her to the nursing home on Sunday.

The entire group ends up going, and it turns out that Komari is sort of like the angel of the nursing home; she comes in every week to bring the people things from home, talk to them, and clean up after them, as part of her theory of the "happiness spiral" that she told Riki about earlier—she believes that if she's happy, and she makes other people happy, then they'll make her happier, and make other people happy, and the happiness will spiral out of control. Riki tries to adapt the theory and successfully convinces a foul-tempered old man to let him clean his room. Komari is amazed, because every time she tries to go in there, the old man yells at her and she gets scared and runs away. When Riki gets mad at the old man, Kojirou, for scaring Komari, Kojirou recognizes the name and tells Riki that his name is Kamikita Kojirou and it would be better to keep Komari away from him. Episode 4 ends here.

Episode 5 begins with a cute scene of the Little Busters practicing baseball. Komari surprises Yuiko by calling her "Yui-chan"; Yuiko says to at least make it "Kurugaya-chan". Rin still can't bear to address Komari as "Komari-chan" and hides behind Riki rather than face Komari; Komari decides to write it on a piece of paper so Rin can just read it. Rin tries to run away, but Yuiko manages to grab her and put her in a lock so she can't escape, then force her to read the paper. When Rin says "Komada" instead, Komari cries and runs away, but trips as always; out of concern, Rin spontaneously says "Komari-chan, are you all right?" and Komari is happy.

In this episode, Komari and Riki grow closer, first spending an evening watching shooting stars together and making wishes, and then going on a date to Komari's old neighborhood. Komari says she had another dream about her brother and she saw white wings flapping in the wind; Riki conjectures that Komari's brother was in a hospital (sheets drying on the roof) and died. He asks Kojirou about this and gets a confirmation; Kojirou convinces him that it would be better to just let the subject go. Riki tries to gently persuade Komari to let it go during their date while they ride in a boat together. She is just about to do so, but on the way home, she and Riki find a dead cat, and the sight of death brings back Komari's memories of her brother. She collapses in the rain, horrified. Episode 5 ends here.

My liking of Little Busters increased even more in these episodes. Although she hasn't done anything yet, I kind of liked Yuiko right off the bat. She has an interesting personality, and she claims that she loves all cute things, which is why she approached Riki to begin with (she considers him cute) and why she likes Komari and Rin so much. Kudryavka was quite adorable too. Rin didn't get much exposure, but she had those couple adorable scenes with Komari. Seeing her get all shy and hide behind Riki is too cute; she seems to think of Riki as a trusted friend and seems to be even closer with him than with her older brother, Kyousuke. I'm hoping that Komari's story will also reveal a little about the relationship between Kyousuke and Rin.

The scene in the nursing home was classic Key—only they could make something like that into a fun, cute sequence. What I especially liked about it was how it showed that Komari isn't just a sweet, childish girl who runs around the school tripping and acting childish—she actually goes out into the world and puts her beliefs into practice, trying to spread around the happiness where it's needed most. She is actually a sweet girl in general, and not just to her friends or people she has a crush on. While I would have to say she's closer to a standard bishoujo game character type than is usual for Key, she still has some depth to her that isn't usual in a character of this type. I also started to be less annoyed by Natsumi Yanase's performance. I think I started to see her voice as Komari's voice, and not as Chihiro from ef's voice; while it can still be a little annoying sometimes, it's cute overall, and her performance reminded me of Sakura Tange as Sakura Kinomoto: at times a little whiny, at times a little annoying, but all in keeping with the character, and cute overall. 

I actually thought the romantic aspect of Episode 5 between Komari and Riki was the weakest part of these three episodes. It's seemed like there was something between those two from the very beginning—for instance, Komari basically joined the team solely because Riki was there, only later discovering Rin—but although their interactions are friendly and cute, they don't make the step up to romance. On Komari's end, she's so childish in general that she doesn't seem to have any awareness of romance, and she even asks Riki if he'll be her replacement onii-chan towards the end of their date, but because of how she is and the writing of the show, it seems like she genuinely wants a brother and isn't asking him to be her onii-chan in an erotic way. On Riki's end, there just doesn't seem to be any spark. He gets along well with Komari, but he gets along well with pretty much everyone; he's sort of a passive person who likes to maintain the harmony, in contrast to Tomoya or Yuuichi, who could get very passionate. I'm interested to see how the romantic aspects of the story involving Riki end up developing, because although he's like Yosuga no Sora's Haruka and Mashiro-iro Symphony's Shingo in being effeminate and gentle, he so far doesn't have their quality of actively trying to make friends with everyone that led into the romantic sides of those shows. Perhaps something will happen with that now that Komari's story has reached its apparent midpoint.

Thoughts on Episodes 6, 7, 8, begun Friday, March 15th, 2013:

I didn't get my wish about Kyousuke and Rin (and in general, I think it's never going to happen, because of this being based on a visual novel), but otherwise, Episode 6, the conclusion to the Komari story, was a beautiful and touching episode, maybe not quite as good as the ending of Fuko's story in Clannad, but as good as or better than just about any other Key conclusion I can think of.

The episode begins with a flashback to Komari's newly-regained memories of her brother. She used to play hide-and-go seek between the hanging sheets with him on the roof of the hospital, and one day, when she cried at the story he told her about the little match girl who died and went to Heaven, he wrote her a picture book, the one she showed Riki and Rin in Episode 5. The picture book is about a chick who hatches, grows up to a hen, and forgets it was ever an egg; then it lays an egg, which goes through the same process, and so on, until the very end when it finally remembers for good. Shortly after this, Takuya told Komari that he might be gone when she wakes up, but not to worry because it's all a dream anyway. Komari falls asleep in his hospital bed and wakes up to find him dead. She managed to convince herself it was all a dream and forget about him, but anytime she sees death, her memories return and she goes into a weird state, wandering around and looking for her brother. This is why Kojiro, her grandfather, won't see her; he saw her like that when his wife, Komari's grandmother, passed away. Eventually she always recovers and forgets her brother again, and Kojiro doesn't want his death to trigger an episode, so he stays away from her. Komari starts calling Riki 'Onii-chan' and ignores his insistence that he isn't. Riki doesn't know what to do, but Kyousuke tells him in another cheesy speech that he just has to be there for Komari and that only he can do it. 

Riki comes up with an idea. Recognizing that Takuya's story mirrors what happens with Komari every time she sees death, he draws a new ending to the book. Rin, wanting to help Komari too, goes around and borrows art supplies from everyone she can find and gives them to Riki. Riki shows the ending to Komari; he drew all the Little Busters as chicks hatching from eggs, and tells Komari that they're all there for her and she can mourn her brother now and move on, making new memories. Komari recovers and thanks Riki; shortly after, Rin runs up to the roof and hugs Komari, saying "Komari-chan" over and over again and making Komari happy. Riki also included lots of blank pages in the book so Komari can draw in her new memories, so Komari starts doing just that.

Although it was a bit short, this was classic Key, with one of their typical nonexistent diseases that gets away with being absurd because it has metaphorical significance and beautiful poetic resonance. Although there's no such illness as what Komari has (so far as I know), it was certainly believable that she would be traumatized by having her brother die next to her while she was sleeping, especially when they were so close. The few scenes of them at the beginning were too cute. With this, Riki showed a little more of his forceful side when he decided to try and do something to help Komari by making a new ending for the picture book. I also liked the final scene where Rin comes up and hugs Komari and says "Komari-chan" repeatedly; it felt like Rin's fondness for Komari had finally overcome her shyness, and she was trying to show all the affection she'd been too nervous to show up to now. Even though Komari isn't so very different in personality from characters in many other visual novel-derived shows, the quality of execution of her story and the way it makes use of relationships with people besides Riki, like Rin, put it far above all of the pretenders to Keyness. If I had, by this point, still harbored any doubts that Little Busters was a worthy addition to the Key oeuvre, all such doubts would now be nothing. (But since it is Key, I gave it a blue whale-sized benefit of the doubt, and it has repaid that in full at this point.)

Episode 7 brings in Saigusa Haruka, who Riki and Rin stumble across standing in a hall with her hands over her eyes. When Riki asks what she's doing, she says "Who am I?" and is impervious to Riki's attempts to explain that you're supposed to cover someone else's eyes when you do that.

Haruka is seriously hyper; she's constantly yelling, flapping her arms, running in circles, and throwing things. She seems to already like Riki as a friend, because she's in a different class, but comes over all the time to talk to him and Masato, who can't get her name right (I don't know what he's saying in Japanese, but the subtitles say "Mongoose Bazooka", which sounds vaguely like her name). Riki has been appointed the official recruiter for the Little Busters, due to his success in getting Komari and Yuiko to join, so he invites Haruka to join. The group tests her as usual; first they have to overcome her ADHD to get her to play catch properly, and find that she's a good thrower, once Kyosuke figures out that she's a lefty and gets her a lefty glove. Kyousuke also asks her what she feels when she puts on that glove, and Haruka sniffs the glove and says "The scent of youth", causing Kyousuke to pass her immediately. But Haruka is also a troublemaker, always playing jokes and breaking things with her hyperness; earlier in the episode, she set a trap at the door of Riki's classroom and dumped a bucket of water on Kengo's head. The disciplinary committee, headed up by the strict and suspiciously Haruka-looking Futaki Kanata show up while she's being tested and drag her away. They even have a dog tackle her when she tries to run away, though the dog is friendly and just licks her face once it has her down. 

Earlier in the episode, Masato fell on a desk and cracked it with his head after Rin set her cats on him during a fight. Kanata gets angry that the Little Busters are always at the center of whatever trouble comes along and is intending to make them do community service to pay for the desk, but Haruka fixes it with some wood glue and saves them. In return, Riki defends her when the disciplinary committee chases her down and accuses her of somehow conning the drinks machine and getting free ones. Riki pays the disciplinary committee members and gets Masato and Rin and Komari to contribute as well. In return, Haruka joins the Little Busters.

This episode was a lot of fun. I liked Haruka and enjoyed watching her act crazy. She reminded me a little of Shizu from Saki Achiga-Hen Episode of Side A, another hyperactive character. I liked how Haruka's character traits all hang together sensibly, though; unlike Shizu, who would run in circles and scream, then sit in a chair playing Mahjong for hours on end, Haruka has a short attention span and stops listening to what people are saying after the first word. But she's also athletic and good at fixing things and working with her hands; all of these are traits of tactile learners, and came together sensibly into a fun character.

Episode 8 finally brings Kud into the spotlight. Masato and Riki find Kud playing with two dogs, which turn out to be the same dogs the disciplinary committee used on Haruka; they're Kud's dogs, Strelka and Belka, that her grandfather sent her from Finland so she wouldn't be lonely. Kud says the dogs are like her little sisters, but they're getting to be smarter than her. She asks Masato to throw a Frisbee for the dogs; when he does, Kud runs off with them and ends up reaching the Frisbee first, jumping into the air and grabbing it. Impressed with her skills, Riki decides to recruit her for the Little Busters. She's just as good at catching balls as Frisbees, impressing everyone with her skill, despite her initial nerves (Komari and Haruka encourage her by saying they don't really understand baseball either). 

The dorm manager tells Kud she has a package. It's actually boxes and boxes of fancy Japanese art—Kud's Russian grandfather loves Japanese culture, and it's due to him that she speaks Japanese so well. Riki and Masato help her carry it to her room and see that she lives alone, in a double room; Kud says she wants a roommate, and Riki suggests applying for one, just like he and Masato did. (Masato first suggests that Riki could be Kud's roommate, then becomes depressed because that would mean Riki doesn't like him anymore.) The roommate application period is almost over, but the dorm manager puts out the bulletin that Kud is looking for a roommate. While they're talking to the dorm manager, Kanata appears and freaks out because boys aren't supposed to be in the girls' dormitory under any circumstances. Kud, Masato, and Riki all get yelled at and forced to write letters of apology and stand with buckets of water. 

Masato and Riki decide to help Kud look for a roommate. Haruka already has two roommates, and Komari has one. Rin doesn't, but her shyness kicks in and she runs away. (Adorably!) Riki thinks that Yuiko might be a good candidate. Yuiko lives alone and says she always felt more comfortable that way, but then she hugs Kud, rubbing Kud's face in her breasts, and tries out lots of angles, deciding that forty-five degrees is the best angle to hug Kud at. She then hugs Kud until Kud's eyes turn into swirls. Yuiko realizes that she can't live with Kud; she tells Riki that living with such an adorable girl, seeing her in pajamas after a bath, and having her sleeping in the next bed, there is no chance that Yuiko wouldn't rape her. For Kud's safety, Yuiko decides to pass on being her roommate. 

Kud takes this the wrong way and laments that Yuiko obviously wouldn't want to live with her because Yuiko is tall, pretty, has big breasts, is smart, and is good at English, while Kud is not tall, not pretty, doesn't have big breasts, isn't smart, isn't good at English, and looks like a child (according to herself). Riki happens to spot the parasol of our final heroine, Mio Nishizono, who is finally introduced in this scene (I've been wondering what the blue-haired girl in the ending's name is since early on). Mio is a short-haired, sickly, quiet, book-loving Yuki Nagato type, a type never seen in a Key work before. Kud is afraid to approach her, but Riki breaks the ice for them. Mio says in her soft voice that she has lots of books in her room, of all types, since she'll read pretty much anything. She mentions that she read a book on Fermat's Last Theorem the other day (yay math!) and found it interesting. Riki and Kud don't respond, and Mio decides that maybe it wasn't so interesting. She says that the other day, all her books fell over at once, causing an avalanche, and she would feel terrible if Kud got trapped under a pile of books. She concludes that she would only cause trouble for Kud, and must decline the offer to be roommates.

Kud is about to resign herself to a lonely life in a room by herself when some mean girls pass by and Riki, Kud, and Masato hear them saying that no one wants to live with Kud because she has so many weird items. Kanata comes along and punishes them for something, then says she heard Kud was looking for a roommate. Showing that she's not a complete witch, Kanata does something nice and says Kud can live with her, patting Kud on the head as she leaves with Kud's dog for a patrol. Riki and Masato aren't too sure and tell Kud she can turn Kanata down, but Kud is happy and touches the spot on her head where Kanata patted her. 

In all the reading I've done about Little Busters, it always seems like Kud is the most popular character, and I can sort of see why. Not only is she adorable in appearance, with her grey hair and aquamarine eyes, her crazy beret and cape outfit, her bat barrette, and her fangs, she also has a cute personality. (Like Kirino, she has two fangs like a vampire, but typically only one is visible at a time. With Kirino, though, I thought for a long time that she had one fang whose location changed at the animators' whim, while we see both of Kud's fangs enough to not get this impression. By the way, Russia is sort of like Romania—vampire country.) I especially like the scene with Yuiko. I'm curious to know why Kanata decided to do something nice for Kud; I've suspected since she first appeared that there was more to Kanata than what we see, but I expected to find out more about her through Haruka, not Kud. Still, it makes sense that if she were going to pick someone to be nice to, it would be the poor, lonely, cute, docile transfer student.

I really liked Mio in her first appearance too. Like Yuiko, Mio is a type of character that Key hasn't really done before. She's somewhat similar to Kotomi, but bears more similarity to the newer book girls who are soft-spoken and strange, like Yuki Nagato. I'm looking forward to seeing more of her. In fact, so far, this series hasn't had a single dud among the characters, male or female. All the heroines are adorable, fun, and, judging by Komari's story, will have interesting plotlines around them. Seeing the new heroines has shaken my conviction that Rin will ultimately be my favorite; I still think she's really cute, but I could see shifting my favor towards Yuiko or Mio or Kud as the story continues. Komari and Haruka are also adorable and lots of fun to watch. (By the way, if Rin ultimately ends up being my favorite, it would be just the second time that the main heroine of a visual novel-derived anime was my favorite, after Sora from Yosuga no Sora. Every other instance I can think of had one of the secondary heroines as my favorite—Nayuki in Kanon, Fuko in Clannad, Rin Tosaka in Fate/Stay Night, Sakuno Uryu in Mashiro-Iro Symphony—but I think if anyone can do it, Rin can.)

Thoughts on Episode 9, written Monday, March 18th, 2013:

I forgot to mention that more evidence of Kud's popularity is the existence of the bizarrely titled spin-off game, Kud Wafter, which continues Kud's story, much as Tomoyo After continued Tomoyo's story. Though I never quite got the impression that Tomoyo was the most popular of the Clannad heroines (it seems like Nagisa was quite popular, and Kyou also seems well loved). Speaking of Tomoyo, even though Clannad had all its designs done by Itaru Hinoue, it had a similar contrast between the childish Nagisa, Kotomi, and Fuko and the more mature Kyou and Tomoyo as what Little Busters has between the childish Komari, Kud, and Haruka and the vaguely more mature Mio and Yuiko (Rin isn't really mature, but I wouldn't call her childish either, so she doesn't fit anywhere). 

Episode 9 was a Rin episode, and mostly a comedy episode, though it showed a side of Rin that we've seen only hints of before, a stubborn, determined side. The Little Busters are finally playing baseball with a decently-sized team, and Rin's pitching has gotten pretty good, but she still feels awkward around the other female members, running away from them without trying any of Komari's homemade cookies. Riki once again tells her that he, Masato, Kengo, and Kyousuke aren't going to be around forever and she should try to make some female friends, but Rin stubbornly refuses again. She finds another note tied to her cat, this one telling her to save the cafeteria. However, when she and Riki go there, everything is well, and all Rin accomplishes is losing another fight against Sasami Sasasegawa and her bootlickers over whether the croquette soba is disgusting or not. (Rin says yes, because the croquette gets all soggy, but Sasasegawa points out that Rin likes the tempura soba with soggy tempura in it, and they fight, with Rin once again ending face-down on the floor—after all, it is three against one, and Riki, being a gentleman, can't get involved in a catfight.)

Shortly after, though, events conspire to make all the cafeteria workers be absent right at dinnertime (I don't know if I made this clear before, but it's a boarding school, so the students are depending on the cafeteria for dinner). Rin asks Riki and Masato for help, but Riki points out that it's far too much work for just the three of them, so Rin goes out and asks the other female Little Busters for help, finding Komari reading her new picture book to Kud in a classroom, Haruka drawing graffiti on the chalkboard in another classroom, and Yuiko reading in her secret garden hideout. Yuiko comments that it must be a real emergency if Rin actually came to ask her. Riki and Masato also get Kyousuke and Kengo to help out. They manage to serve an eccentric menu made up of three options—a fried shrimp set, an onigiri set, and a curry set, with jelly for dessert—where the trays have unequal amounts of food and Rin puts more and more cups of jelly on them as the night progresses to fill in for all the food they don't have. Towards the end of the night, Riki once again succumbs to narcolepsy; while asleep, he has a flashback to his childhood, when he was in the hospital. The other Little Busters came to visit him, including Rin, who he remembers as hiding behind the doorframe (so it must have been early in their acquaintance, because Rin totally loves him now; when she doesn't know what to do for a menu and can't look weak now that she made a bold proclamation of her intent to follow through, she leaves the room and sends Riki a text message asking him what to do, then returns and announces his idea to everyone as if it was her own). Riki wakes up just before ten and thinks how alone he feels, waking up in a room by himself after having an attack, when Kyousuke appears at the door, just as he did in Riki's flashback, and invites Riki back to the cafeteria. Rin insisted that they wait for him to wake up before eating, so everyone is there.

Like I said above, this episode was mostly light and comedic, and it did well at that; there were lots of cute Rin scenes, but also great scenes with everyone else, even Masato, who apparently can lift weights in his sleep. Komari reading Kud her self-authored picture book was totally adorable, and Haruka juggling the daikon was pretty funny; Yuiko got both the scene where she responded to Rin's summons and a later scene when everyone is putting on aprons and she comments how "Oneechan" is getting fired up with all these cute girls in aprons around (she declared herself "Oneechan" back when she first joined the team, even though she's not significantly older than the others; maybe it's a yuri thing). My favorite scene with Rin was the one where she ran out of the room and texted Riki asking what to do, and I also liked when she kept putting jelly on the food trays; it was also adorable when she held up everyone's dinner until ten so Riki could be there, and showed how much she cares about Riki. I actually don't like the scenes with Sasami Sasasegawa, because I don't like seeing poor Rin get beat up in a three-on-one battle so much. Perhaps if Rin can become better friends with the other girls on the team, then she, Haruka, and Yuiko can show Sasasegawa and her yes-girls what a fair fight is like.

I have vague memories of what the ending of the visual novel turns out to be from when I read about it on Wikipedia, but I won't record them here. Suffice to say that we see hints of the mystery at the center of the plot in this episode when Riki wonders how the person who tied the note to Rin's cat knew that the cafeteria would be in trouble in the near future, and Riki's narcolepsy gets connected to it all—he previously passed out when he, Rin, Komari, Kyousuke, and Masato had finished cleaning the storeroom, following the instructions of the previous note, and once again, as soon as the instructions from the note are carried out, Riki is unconscious. I suspect that his description of the narcoleptic attacks as "losing my connection to this world" are more literal than they seem.

Next time, Mio really comes in with a whole episode to herself. I liked Mio on her first appearance in Episode 8, and I am looking forward to seeing more of her; she, Rin, and Yuiko are currently the strongest candidates for the not very coveted position of my favorite character, with Kud also in the running. Even Haruka could pull out a dark horse victory.

Thoughts on Episodes 10, 11, 12, 13, written Thursday, April 4th, 2013:

Aside from Episode 11, which is a rather silly filler episode, these episodes all concern Mio. I'm glad for this, because I feel like Little Busters was starting to fall into a bit of a rut where it would have filler-type episodes that don't really focus on a particular character or reveal anything about anyone. In Kanon we were always in someone's story, so this couldn't happen; in Clannad we had similar episodes to this, where everyone is together in a group and the story doesn't really focus on anyone, but Clannad usually managed to infuse these with some kind of significance, as with the basketball game where Tomoya's character was revealed, and where the aim was to help Nagisa establish the drama club. Episodes like the cafeteria episode don't really have this dynamic. I think I know why they exist—related to the ending of the series—but I fear that the series could start to stagnate if we have too many of these episodes. 

Episode 10 was far from a bad episode, but it was sort of slow-moving, and I was completely wired on caffeine and not in any fit state to watch it. It focuses on Mio a little more, showing her communicate with Riki and showing how she's regarded by the rest of the class. Mio is quite an interesting character; although I compared her with Yuki Nagato above, the similarity is really limited to lack of expression and love of books. Mio has a poetic manner of speech and a clear sense of the rhythms of language (we also saw a little of this when she appeared in Episode 8); she's cynical, yet somehow romantic, and antisocial, yet somehow lonely. Riki learns at the end of Episode 10 that she believes a poem about a seabird that flies untouched by the blue of the sky or of the sea sums up her ideal and encapsulates her being. She sits alone under a tree, reading and feeding the birds, thinking deep thoughts about reading and the philosophy of literature, unless interrupted by flying baseballs. Her classmates don't actively bully her—when Riki thinks she is being picked on, it turns out to be a misunderstanding--but they don't seem to really understand her and largely ignore her.

In Episode 11, we detour from Mio's story to do a somewhat ridiculous filler episode involving a test of courage. This episode wasn't without value; for instance, we get a cute scene of Rin, Komari, and Kud all being terrified. Kud tries to summon her dogs to escort the three of them through the dark school building, but the dogs have been trained by the disciplinary committee not to come inside. Rin then tries summoning her cats, but they just walk off without following her. We also get to see Haruka scream and cling to Riki when she's forced to reveal, after acting brave the whole time, that she could only act that way because Yuiko was walking in front and confidently uncovering all the traps Kyousuke had set up. The ending, where Kyousuke discovers that the "evil spirit" haunting the school is actually a Steller's sea eagle that he rescued as a child, was sort of crazy, since the thing everyone's been chasing around the whole time looked nothing like an eagle. 

Episode 12 returns to Mio, and was probably my favorite episode since Episode 8. It begins with the guys finding the girls collecting money for charity in town; Komari got Rin, Yuiko, Kud, and Haruka to all come with her and collect. Kyousuke is moved by Komari's theory of the happiness spiral and wavers between giving five yen and ten thousand yen, the only two denominations he has on him. Riki then happens to see a girl who looks like Mio, only smiling and not carrying a parasol.

Riki, thinking Mio looks lonely, asks her to join the Little Busters as their manager. Mio at first thinks they're debuting as idols, and says that Kyousuke and Kengo will do well, though Masato and Riki have a problem, unless Riki is willing to do yaoi with Kyousuke. She becomes the manager and exchanges phone numbers with everyone, despite not knowing how to use her phone until Yuiko shows her. Masato asks her to call him since his call log is full of Riki and Kyousuke and no one else; all the girls call him as a favor and he is delighted that his call log looks like a popular guy, then decides it feels weird and wants Riki to fill up his log again (Masato has a weird attachment to Riki, as when he cried at the idea of Riki moving in with Kud). Kyousuke enters the Little Busters in a tanka contest with the idea that everyone can write one line.

[continued Thursday, April 18th, 2013]

The group writes some bizarre tanka and makes Mio walk out. Riki follows her to the tree that she always reads under, where she admits that she enjoyed herself, and just for a moment she considered staying. She also composed a tanka herself.

Mio starts staying home from school, apparently ill; Riki notices how her empty desk goes unremarked and thinks about a comment Mio once made that she's like a pebble by the road to most of the class. He begins to notice strange effects happening in her absence; Masato forgets who she is, as do Kyousuke, Komari, and Kud. He wants to go visit her, but it's too difficult to get into the girls' dormitory. One evening, as he stares out the window of the classroom into the rain, he sees the smiling girl without a parasol down in the courtyard and goes down to talk to her. He learns that her name is Midori, and she calls herself Mio's twin. In Episode 13, Mio says it's finally time to go and brings Riki with her to the beach, which she calls the place where the end begins. They encounter Midori, who takes Mio's parasol and reveals that Mio has no shadow. Mio gives Riki her precious book with the poem that inspired her worldview, then disappears, and Riki collapses in a narcoleptic attack.

In Epiisode 14, Riki wakes up in a strange new world where Midori has replaced Mio. She is social, popular, and beloved by her classmates, the exact opposite of Mio. Riki is the only one who remembers the real Mio; he confronts Midori several times, asking her to bring back the real Mio, but Midori taunts him by telling him that Mio wore glasses and scoffing when he doesn't remember, then revealing that she lied, all to shake Riki's confidence in himself. Kyousuke gives Riki one of his usual cheesy speeches about believing in himself, and Riki goes looking for some evidence other than the book she left him that Mio existed. He sees them taking down the tanka displays and remembers Mio saying she wrote a tanka. He looks up and down the rows and manages to find one that was obviously hers; when he finds it, Midori asks if he wants to see Mio and Riki says he does.

Riki appears on an empty beach and is told by Midori's voice that Mio is here, and she's about to turn herself into a bird and fly off, untouched by the blue of the sky or the sea. Mio appears and tells Riki how Midori came to exist. Mio loved reading from a young age and often sat and read by herself; one day she caught sight of "another girl in the mirror" and invited that girl to come play with her; the mirror girl spoke back and agreed, and came out. She acquired the name Midori and began calling Mio "Neechan". Mio's mother began to believe Mio was mentally ill and had her put through medical procedures to convince her that Midori didn't exist, finally succeeding around the time Mio was in middle school; Mio forgot that Midori existed. But when she read the poem, she remembered, and Midori appeared again, leading to the current situation. Mio always wanted to become like the bird in the poem because she craved solitude. She says goodbye to Riki and becomes a bird, but Riki runs into the ocean after her and tells her that she didn't need to look for solitude, because everyone is born lonely and comes to know themselves by interacting with other people. Midori also tells Mio that she can achieve her true purpose if Mio begins to interact with people and fuses with Mio again. Mio becomes human and becomes friends with the Little Busters, continuing as their manager. 

The Mio story was rather poetic and full of beautiful, abstract imagery. It could be a little slow and a little too abstract at times, and I thought the ending could have had more impact, though its low-key nature was also part of the poetic quality. I also think it might have been better to let Mio be around for a while before launching into her story. The Komari story also somewhat had this problem; we barely knew Komari when the story began, and though we came to know her during it, the emotional impact could have been greater if we'd known her a little better. Episode 15 is an example of the sort of thing that could have made a difference. (It's also the best comedy episode since Episode 8, though the tanka contest and Mio's vision for the Little Busters as male idols were up there with the best comedy scenes in the series so far.)

Riki, Kyousuke, Kengo, and Masato are playing games in Riki and Masato's room when Komari and Kud appear and tell Riki it's terrible and he'd better come with them. Riki asks what's so terrible and they say it's not so terrible and leave. Kyousuke and Masato are relieved that Riki chose them over the girls; Kyousuke asks Riki if there's anyone he loves and Riki says there isn't. He asks Kyousuke in turn, who says no one, then says he loves Riki. Riki, uncomfortable with the gayness, says he doesn't love Kyousuke; Masato is relieved that it won't cut into his time with Riki, but Kyousuke is hurt and leaves the room in tears. Riki has to go find him and tell him that he does love him, as much as he loves everyone in the Little Busters, making something that was extremely rose-colored merely sappy.

Rin sends Riki a text message summoning him to her room on urgent business; Riki sneaks through the girls' dorm like Solid Snake and reaches Rin's room, where he is seized by Yuiko and Haruka. All the girls are there, and they won't let him go; they insist that Riki attend their girly sleepover party. Yuiko answers Riki's phone and tells Kyousuke she's holding him captive; Kyousuke, Masato, and Kengo start competing over who's going to go rescue Riki, playing various games to decide who has the necessary skills.

The girls feed Riki sweets and torture him; Riki is determined to leave, but the disciplinary committee has blocked him in and Yuiko insists that he'll decide to stay with his harem. When it's time to take baths, Rin refuses to go in because Riki is there, so Yuiko ties him up and blindfolds him (in an erotic manner). When Rin is hesitant to bathe with Komari, Yuiko threatens to go in with her, then threatens to send Riki in with her, and gets her to go in with Komari. Afterwards, Kud wants to go in with Rin, so Rin has to bathe twice and passes out from the steam. Haruka and Yuiko then go in together, with Haruka seemingly transfixed by Yuiko's breasts, whose size is even more apparent when she wears pajamas. Finally, they force Riki to take a bath.

While in the bath, Riki realizes what must have happened: the girls wanted to have a girly sleepover, but Rin was too shy, so they abducted Riki so that Rin would be more comfortable. He comes out to find that they stole his clothes and left him one of Yuiko's uniforms. Riki is forced to dress as a girl; Mio blushes and takes pictures of him, and Yuiko says he looks good enough to sneak into a women's bath. Kud and Komari tie a ribbon in his hair to complete the look. Kud finds Rin's stack of newspapers that she gives to the cats and rolls one up into a sword. She, Komari, and Haruka play chanbara with rolled up newspaper swords. Yuiko suggests that they all play chanbara. Haruka crushes Komari and Kud again, but gets taken down by Mio in a sneak attack; angered by Yuiko's bullying of Komari, Rin challenges her to a duel, but Futaki Kanata shows up in the middle and yells at them all. Riki thinks he's screwed, but she doesn't recognize him in his girl outfit and he is able to pose as a commuter girl who was smuggled into the dorm by Yuiko. 

The next morning, Riki sneaks out before everyone is awake, but thanks Yuiko before he goes (I assume because he had fun and because he appreciated how she looked out for Rin by kidnapping him for Rin's benefit). Kyousuke appears and tells Riki he's come to rescue him; he also compliments Riki's female outfit, showing the pictures Mio took, which Yuiko sent to his cell phone. 

I had a lot of fun watching this episode, and I liked how it showed Rin gradually becoming less uncomfortable around the other girls. She still needs Riki around to be totally comfortable, but she got to the point where she could have a sleepover as long as he was there, where in the first episode she ran away from even Komari, who she's now closest with of all the girls. I especially like how she's gradually becoming less uncomfortable; after she became friends with Komari after the Komari story, I was expecting the shyness to just disappear, but the process of shyness disappearing has been quite slow. She's now over wanting to run away, but she's still just getting to the point where she can interact with Yuiko as much as with Komari and Kud.

Of course, Riki's crossdressing was a lot of fun too. The weird shounen ai dialogue at the beginning of the episode was also really funny; for a while now, Masato has had a strange habit of talking about Riki like they're a couple, and now Kyousuke is in on it too. It is a little suspicious how they can be surrounded by girls every day and never take any notice at all (even Riki, who recruited all the girls). The lack of romance in the story buoys this impression too. At this rate, Riki is going to end up with Kyousuke or Masato by the end, and Yuiko will turn all the girls into her lesbian harem and become the new main character. (But that might be fun to watch too.)

It's hard to believe we're over halfway through the series. I am hoping things will really get rocking in the second half, with good stories for Haruka, Yuiko, Kud, and Rin. I hope that we can also get some good incidental scenes for Mio and Komari, especially Mio, who didn't get as many of them as she deserved. (She had some good ones in Episode 15, though, like taking pictures of Riki in a dress or sneak attacking Haruka.) I really like Mio as a character, but I felt like her story was more of a beginning than an ending.
** Episodes 17 and 18 <2014-11-05 Wed>
I watched Episode 17 around the same time I watched the first 16, but I didn’t really like it and I was kind of disappointed with the Mio story, so I ended up not watching the show anymore after that. Since I’ve been rewatching Clannad, and since I kind of wasn’t that thrilled with Kotoura-san (it’s good but not amazing), and since I was really in the mood for something more heavyweight after poor Hanayamata and its poor, sad, low budget, and also I read my notes on the first run of episodes and was reminded how good they mostly were, I decided to try and finish Little Busters. 

Episode 17 starts the Haruka story. Haruka is a mischief maker and runs around school breaking things and making trouble, being chased down by Futaki Kanata and her student council henchmen. However, Riki discovers that she also fixes things that she breaks, and even things she didn’t break, as a way of apologizing to the school for her transgressions.

Haruka is disgraced and embarrassed when someone puts up posters showing that her father is a criminal who is in jail for murder and arson. In Episode 18, Haruka tells everyone what the deal is. Her family, the Saigusa family, is an old and isolated family somewhat like the Souma in Fruits Basket. They have a bizarre custom where their head daughter marries two men. Haruka and Kanata are twin sisters, but they’re actually from different fathers; in very rare cases, if a woman is with two men during the same period, she can be fertilized twice. (This happens in real life but I suspect that it is not, in fact, what happened here, although Haruka thinks that it is.) Haruka’s mother and both of her husbands had some kind of falling out with the family, and it resulted in one of them, Saigusa Shou, trying to burn down a house and murder someone. He was sent to prison, and the other two, Haruka’s mother and her other husband, disappeared. Since the family had no idea which daughter came from which father, and since they’re stupid, they decided to see which one was better and declare her not the criminal-spawn, and make her the heir of the family. Since Kanata did better in school and sports, she was declared the non-criminal spawn, and Haruka was made into the pariah and hated and blamed for everything. Haruka makes trouble at school because every time she does something, the school contacts the Saigusa family, and the adults yell at Kanata for not stopping her, which delights Haruka since she has no other way to get back at them.

Riki and the others affirm their friendship for Haruka and say they don’t care if she’s the daughter of a criminal, but also ask why no one has ever found out the truth about who is whose daughter. Haruka says Saigusa Shou, the only one around who knows, won’t tell anyone.

Afterwards, the Little Busters play a nice game of baseball to cheer everyone up, but Kanata appears and tells them they’d better stay away from Haruka. Riki asks if she put up the posters and Kanata answers ambiguously. 

Haruka makes chiffon cake in the home ec room. Rin sees some girls whispering about her outside and hisses and bares her teeth at them, chasing them away. Haruka’s chiffon cakes are awful, even though she claims she’s great at cooking with eggs; she feeds them to Riki and Rin, who imagine a desert.

Riki sees Kanata talking to someone in a limousine at the school gates; Kanata says putting up posters was going too far, and the woman in the limo slaps her and tells her to just do as she’s told. Riki asks Kanata if that was someone from the main family and is surprised when Kanata answers. Kanata says she wonders if happiness is a zero-sum game (not in those exact words, but that’s what she describes) and Riki, somewhat surprised, asks if Kanata is also unhappy and says it sounded like she was concerned about Haruka.

Haruka tells Riki and Rin that Saigusa Shou recently got out of prison and she intends to go ask him if he’s her father. She says if he is, she’ll accept that, but she can’t stand the uncertainty anymore. Saigusa Shou is a scruffy drunkard, and Haruka doesn’t exactly butter him up—actually she yells at him, and runs away crying when he won’t tell her anything. Rin goes after her, while Riki tries to convince Shou to tell her, but Shou says she’s better off not knowing.

Riki chases down Haruka and Rin and they talk about what to do next. Riki asks if Kanata might know the answer, and Haruka says she might, since she visited Shou in prison a few times, but she would never tell Haruka since the current situation favors her.  

Kud now feels uncomfortable around Kanata after everything that’s happened, so she pretends to be asleep when Kanata comes home late at night. She sees hair beads like Haruka’s on Kanata’s desk. The next day, Haruka comes to Riki with some new chiffon cakes, which are good this time; when Riki says they’re much better than last time, Haruka freaks out at the words “last time” and drops the platter. She then asks Riki, with a demonic grin, if he loves her, throwing him off balance, until Riki notices her looking over his shoulder. Riki turns around and sees the real Haruka; he’s actually been talking to Kanata, in disguise as Haruka.

I was confused as to Kanata’s motives, but in the next episode, we get to hear what she has to say for herself. I suspect that it will turn out that both girls are the daughters of Saigusa Shou and that they’re actually identical twins and not weird half-sister twins like everyone thought. That would explain why Kanata went to visit him “a few times” and not “once, when she found out that she’s not his daughter and then stopped going and meeting some random guy in prison who’s the father of her unloved half sister that she hates”. Except I also expect to find out that Kanata’s feelings towards Haruka are a lot more complicated than that.  

Although I can’t say I love this situation, I do have to commend the writers for not relying on the situational drama too much and for continuing to slip in little bits of characterization. Probably my favorite scene of Episode 18 was the one where Haruka admits that she gets in trouble so Kanata will be yelled at by the relatives, because her expression was so manic and crazy and not at all remorseful or desperate. It actually seemed like it makes her happy to get Kanata in trouble. It was an interesting dark touch on her personality. I kind of expect that Kanata’s dislike for her is much greater than it was exactly because Haruka is always purposely getting her in trouble with the family by acting out at school. We already knew that Kanata wasn’t a complete witch since she invited Kud to live with her, and we also know that she didn’t put up the posters; I kind of doubt that she’s dumb enough to believe that Haruka is a natural born criminal. The expression on Kanata’s face when she was in disguise as Haruka and asked Riki if he loved her was also interesting, in that it was completely bizarre and disturbing. Was that Kanata’s real expression, or was that her impression of Haruka?

After recently seeing all the wasted opportunities in Gochiusa and Hanayamata, it’s easier to recognize the incredible character writing in Little Busters. I’m glad I decided to give this series another chance, because even though Episode 18 wasn’t a home run, it definitely introduced a lot of interesting questions whose answers I am looking forward to. Plus, Rin’s angry cat impression was adorable.
** Episodes 19, 20, 21, 22 <2014-11-08 Sat>
In the conclusion of Haruka’s story, we find out that Kanata cared about Haruka all along like I thought, but she was being beaten by the uncles in the Futaki family and was threatened with ejection from the family, which would have put her in the same place as Haruka, which she understandably feared. Kanata has scars and welts on her arms where she was hit with a leather belt, as Kud has seen before in their room when she undresses. Kanata dressed as Haruka to test Riki’s resolve to save Haruka, since she doesn’t believe that someone can save another person (like Meme Oshino).

Haruka believed that cooking with eggs was her specialty because she thought Kanata was allergic to eggs. When they were children, they had a school assignment to make something from eggs, and the family arbitrarily decided that that would be the test for who was a criminal’s daughter. (This family keeps on getting stupider. You’d think giving each daughter two husbands would keep the gene pool diverse and prevent this sort of thing, but obviously not.) Kanata didn’t want to compete, so she made miso soup, and when she got beaten up and thrown around, told Haruka it was because she was allergic to eggs. Haruka believed that lie all the way up to the present day, when she saw Kanata make chiffon cake and realized it wasn’t true.

After Riki tells Haruka this, Haruka doesn’t react with relief; she is actually angry, and storms out. Haruka later calms down and admits that hating Kanata was all she had, because she had no one else to blame, but after she and the group confront Kanata and hear her side of the story, Haruka decides to give up her hatred and never turn to the Dark Side of the Force...er, reforge her sisterly bonds.

Haruka and Kanata go together to see Shou, who tells them that he and the other husband were both childhood friends of their mother. Both of them loved her, but the one she loved was the other, non-criminal one. They both married her and Haruka and Kanata were born. The three of them were planning to run away with Haruka and Kanata so they wouldn’t have to grow up in such a terrible family, but the family found out and took the twins. Shou went back to try and get them, but things went bad and he ended up killing someone and burning down a house.

Haruka stops him before he tells her who her father is, saying that it doesn’t matter anyway now that she’s decided to give up hatred. Shou brings them to see their mother and their other father for the first time since they were babies.

My suspicion is that Shou is neither girl’s father, and they’re actually a pair of normal twins fathered by the other father, who was their mother’s real love. 

After this is a Kud episode. At this point I’ve more or less narrowed down my contenders for the not very coveted spot of favorite character to Kud and Rin. You can’t really go on how good each girl’s story is, because, to be perfectly honest, none of the stories are that good, at least compared to Clannad. Each is about at the level of Yukine’s or Tomoyo’s stories, which were my two least favorite Clannad stories. Komari’s maybe reached the level of the Makoto story in Kanon. But so far, we’ve had nothing on the level of the best Clannad and Kanon stories (that would be Fuko’s and Mai’s, and not counting the After Story in Clannad). But I do like the characters, and the comedy portions are good, so this episode, being a Kud moe/comedy episode, was probably my favorite of this batch.

Kud is depressed because of how bad she is at English and how everyone laughs at her accent. She’s also doing not so well in her other subjects, so the Little Busters decide to tutor her, in preparation for an upcoming practical English exam. Komari apparently is the best at English of the group, so she takes that subject. When she sees that Kud struggles even with basic vocabulary, she advises making flashcards. Rin is also weak in English, so she and Kud make flashcards and study together. Mio tutors her in math and science, and with Mio’s help, Kud manages to do well on those exams.

Kud tells everyone how she used to travel around with her grandfather. She’s visited most of Europe, as well as several locations in Asia, and Brazil, for times periods ranging from a few months to a few years. Her original home is actually a tiny Pacific island called Tebua which is a former part of the Soviet Union. (Later the subtitles change the spelling to Tebwa; I assume it’s fictional, given what happens later.) She has dual citizenship with Tebua and Japan. 

Riki also finds out that Kud is sort of a physics buff, when Kanata finds her in the library and returns a book she borrowed about quantum mechanics (it’s about the many-worlds interpretation of QM; the commenters thought this was the same as what Kotomi’s parents studied in Clannad, but that was actually string theory). Kud tells him that she likes to read technical books and annotate the margins (which Kanata thinks is bad, but they’re all evidence of Kud’s vast and deep knowledge). She’s actually a year younger than everyone else, but she was doing school by mail while traveling with her grandfather and she got ahead of her grade, so she was able to enter a higher grade when she came to Japan. Riki realizes that Kud is actually extremely smart and is just being stifled by the lame Japanese school system that values rote memorization. (He doesn’t think it in those words, but something to that effect.) And he says so when some mean girls from Kud’s class come by and say they’re taking bets on whether she’ll pass the test, with 8:2 odds against, and that they like watching the funny foreign girl flail and fail and don’t think she should pass. But when Kud goes to take exams, she gets horrible nerves and always screws up—as she does on the English test (which I thought was supposed to be practical, but it’s a multiple choice fill-in-the-bubble affair like usual). Kud realizes at the last minute that all of her answers were shifted down by one, so she fails and has to go to remedial classes. The rest of the Little Busters decide to go too, even though they don’t need it, spurred by noticing that Haruka got 85% (by pure luck—she rolled a pencil) and yet pretends to have failed so she can go to remedial classes with Kud.

The series takes an episode to do a subplot about Sasasasasa Sasami (as Rin calls her) and how some guy has fallen in love with her, but she’s in love with Kengo. Rin receives a note on a cat telling her to help out the lovesick guy and gives him all sorts of bad advice, like confessing to her in a rap (the guy likes hip-hop) or attacking Kengo where she can see and showing her how tough he is. Knowing it’s impossible for any one guy alone, Rin comes up with a plan where she first trips Kengo, then Riki appears and throws a plate at him, then the guy who’s in love with Sasasasa Sasami finishes him off, but Kengo overcomes all three obstacles and thinks it’s another intra-Little Busters practical joke, and Sasami just falls in love with him even further. 

Rin calls out Sasami and tells her it wasn’t the guy’s fault, it was hers, and convinces Sasami to give her her cell phone number for the guy to have. Sasami shows up at the field later to ask what kind of food Kengo likes so she can make it. Masato tells Rin to tell her he likes something weird, so Rin does, and Sasami somehow takes it as a sign of his greatness, until Rin says that was a lie and sets off another fight.

After that, the Kud-ness goes on. Riki finds Kud praying and doing a ceremony from Tebua under the stars one night, so he helps her out by painting the tribal markings on her back for her. (This was a pretty weird scene.) Kud tells him that her mother is the one who told her about the Southern Cross, which is the focal point of this ceremony even though they can’t see it.

It turns out that Kud’s mother is a cosmonaut. (Interestingly, in Japanese they use the Russian-derived pronunciation “kosumonafuto”.) She inspired Kud’s love of space and desire to also be a cosmonaut. She named her daughter “Kudryavka” after the dog (also called Laika) that was the first terrestrial animal in space. (Kud’s dogs, Strelka and Belka, are also named after spacefaring dogs.) Kud sees her mother on the news just before a rocket launch, but the launch goes bad and her fate is left in doubt.

Even though travel to and from Tebua is suspended, Kud receives a ticket from the embassy to go back if she wants, since her mother is a hero to the people. Kud is conflicted about what to do; it turns out that she ran away from home when she came to Japan. She was in a special aviation school, but all the classes were in English, and Kud is bad at English, so she couldn’t do it. She dropped out and ran away, coming to Japan, but then she wasn’t a great student in Japan either, and felt disappointed in herself. Kud doesn’t know if she should go back, given that she might never be able to come back.

Kyousuke has a talk with her and tells her that no matter what she decides to do, the Little Busters will support her. Riki finds a box of Kud’s space things from her room—her model rockets, her books on physics and rocket engineering, and her mother’s dogtags, which he translates from the Russian. He also reads Kud’s diary about how she was writing theses about relativity and studying differential equations. Riki finds her and tells her that even if she can’t become a cosmonaut, she can still find a place to fit in and be involved with her love of space and spaceflight. Kud decides to go home and find out what happened, even though she might not come back. Kanata also encourages her and says she’ll miss her while she’s gone, and Yuiko and Riki make her promise to come back.

Apparently in the next episode, things take a turn for the weird when Kud is captured by rebel forces and imprisoned. But this story is already pretty damn weird. For one thing, it’s just weird when anime has correct depictions of foreigners—even little things like the language and clothes. (And even though Kud’s Russian pronunciation isn’t much better than her English, just the mere fact of having it at all is weird.) Then they throw in that whole science and engineering, cosmonaut angle, and the unstable former Soviet republics thing, and it almost looks realistic in a way. It’s just weird. 

But I love Kud as a character. If she were going to realize some Russian stereotype, I would’ve expected it to be ballerina, but no, she has to go to space.  And unexpectedly, I personally empathize with her feelings, both her disappointment in her academic achievements and her confusion about her mixed racial and ethnic background, since I have a similar history. (Not, of course, to the extent that she does, but in an oddly similar way.) Plus, she’s adorable. (It turns out her beret and mantle are her mother’s.) Her few scenes with Kanata were an especial high point for adorability.

Even though Little Busters doesn’t always pull off the dramatic bits to my satisfaction, it’s always good on comedy and character interaction. Even episodes that are going to be mostly dramatic will have little bits of comedy (like Clannad also did), which goes a long way towards lightening things up when they get too heavy. There was a good scene at the start of Episode 21 where the Little Busters clean the clubroom, despite the opposition of Kyousuke and Haruka, who says if they clean, it could turn out that the clubroom is on the confluence of dragonic leylines that hold the earth together, which could anger the dragons and cause an upheaval that would destroy the entire earth and endanger the universe, only to find that everyone started cleaning without her while she was ranting. Yuiko then says she’d like to put Kud in a maid outfit. Everyone imagines how fitting this would be, but then Mio says they could also put Riki in a maid outfit, and Yuiko imagines it, causing Riki to refuse to be in a maid outfit, even though Yuiko says it would be cute. 

The scene with Kud and her dogs where she explains how the three of them got their names was also adorable.  And even though the Sasasasasa episode could have been a throwaway, it turned out to be quite funny, even though it was utterly tangential. I think part of the reason the dramatic parts aren’t as good as Clannad is that the situations are so over-the-top and bizarre that it can be hard to find the real emotions in them, so I mostly prefer the comedy parts. (And I have to admit, I did in Clannad too, even though the drama was mostly very well-done.)
** Episodes 23, 24, 25, 26, and Refrain Episode 1 <2014-11-14 Fri>
Kud ends up in the middle of a war zone. She and her grandfather hide out in a cabin on the coast, but when her grandfather leaves one night to see her mother, who’s been found, the cabin is attacked and Kud is taken captive by rebel forces. She’s stripped naked and chained up by her arm. Everyone in Japan is worried about her, and thanks to some miracle, the gear from her mother’s spaceship that Riki is holding appears in her hand, allowing her to smash open the manacle and escape. Kud makes it back to Japan and says she spoke to her mother, who told her it was all right and she wasn’t mad at her for leaving. 

In the next episode, Rin receives a note on her cat telling her to put on a puppet show. Soon after, they encounter a girl who’s disappointed because her friend was going to put  on a puppet show for her with a stuffed panda, but some mean boys tore open the panda and now it’s scary and makes her cry. Rin offers to put on a puppet show instead, but she has no idea how to do it, so she and Riki ask Komari for help. Komari shows them her newest picture books, including one with a penguin who tries his hardest and eventually gets to ride a star, and another with a boy and girl who help eight dwarfs solve their problems. As each dwarf’s problem is solved, it disappears. This gives Riki a sense of dejà vu for some reason.

Komari makes the puppets for Rin to do the penguin story, and it’s a big hit. Afterwards, Riki passes out from his narcolepsy and ends up back in his room at 9:45, like always.

My favorite scene from this very cute episode was in the library, where Riki, Rin, and Komari are trying to write a story for the puppet show. Haruka shows up and starts to get curious about what they’re doing. Even though Rin tells Haruka she’s being annoying, pretty soon everyone is there trying to write a puppet show. Masato stops Yuiko’s reading after the first sentence, “It was a dark and slimy night”. Mio makes up a story by using what she has available: an army guy, some kind of robot, a doll-sized pink apron, and a weird creature. She makes a story about a couple who go on their honeymoon just as aliens invade; the army guy, wearing the apron, plays the wife, and the robot is the husband who for some reason says “Sir, yes sir!” when the “wife” calls him for his dinner or his bath. I’m glad that Mio, who is a good character but has very few good scenes, got to have this.

In the next episode, Kyousuke announces that they have a game coming up against the all-star team, which is composed of the captains of all the major sports clubs. Riki points out that they don’t have enough members—they need nine, but have only eight. Masato tries to count everyone and somehow counts Riki and Rin twice and ends up with ten members. Kyousuke says he’s confident their last member will arrive soon.

Riki thinks that it would solve all their problems if Kengo would join, but unless something major happens, he’s not going to. Of course, something major does happen; Riki and Rin see him talking to Koshiro, a girl from a big kyuudo family who was a champion in the kyuudo club, but lost her right eye to an accident and now can’t shoot. Later, in class, they make an offhand remark about this, but it causes a huge stir and humiliates Koshiro, who says she was only talking to him about martial arts and asking for his advice. It seems she feels her life is pretty much over now that she can’t shoot, but Kengo told her that was wrong and she just had to find something else to do now. 

Koshiro goes to the roof to kill herself. The students are all ordered to stay put while the teachers go handle it, but Riki and Rin guess what’s going on and go up to try and stop her. The teachers say generic things that you say to talk down a suicide jumper, and Riki thinks that they’re not getting through to her. Just as she jumps, Kengo appears and barrels over the teachers, jumps off after, grabs her, and somehow lands well enough that he only fractures his wrist and sprains his knee. 

Since Kengo can’t do kendo anymore—because of his injury, and because he was banned for the semester for barrelling over the teachers—he decides to join the Little Busters and do one-armed batting, which he manages to succeed at with some practice. He also can’t run very well, but he makes a policy to only hit home runs that allows him to do well anyway. 

With that, Kyousuke declares that he’s going to choose a team captain. To everyone’s surprise, he picks Riki. The girls all insult Riki at first by saying he doesn’t seem suitable and he’s not much compared to Kyousuke, especially after he doesn’t get Kanata’s text that the field will be closed and ends up with practice cancelled before he can even enact his first order. Later, the girls all come to Riki individually as he’s trying to work out positions and batting order (Haruka jumps out of a locker with a New Year’s cracker) and tell him how much he’s helped them solving their problems and how much faith they actually have in him, even he’s not impressive compared to Kyousuke. Mio also gives him a notebook of data she compiled about the other team to aid his decisions.

The Little Busters play against the all-star team and apparently do quite well, but we find out in Episode 1 of Refrain that they just barely lost because Masato missed an opportunity. Komari holds a pancake party for them anyway. She, Kud, and Rin cook the pancakes, while Yuiko and Mio get the drinks and the guys hang decorations. Rin upbraids Haruka for showing up even though she didn’t do anything to help set it up. Kyousuke comments that this is the first time he’s ever eaten Rin’s cooking, and it’s good; this seems to make Rin happy, and she renews her pancake-cooking efforts with twice the vigor.

Later, some mean girls put thumbtacks in Kud’s bag and shred Komari’s notebooks. Riki goes to confront them and finds out, due to the guilty conscience of one girl (who is totally voiced by Kana Hanazawa), that the leader (who sounds like she’s voiced by the same actress who played Numachi Rouka in Hanamonogatari) hates Yuiko and wants to punish anyone who’s friends with her. The lead mean girl denies it and says “Where’s your proof?”, so Yuiko appears and plays a recording of her saying exactly that she targeted Kudryavka because of her friendship to Yuiko. 

Yuiko becomes psychotically angry; she shatters the door into pieces with one kick and says if they don’t want their faces to look like that, they’d better go away and leave her and her friends alone. The two mean girls run away, and the guilty girl also leaves after Yuiko says that since she stood by, she’s also guilty, but in her case Yuiko is willing to ignore her and pretend nothing happened. The teachers come, and Masato and Kengo pretend they were fighting again so Yuiko and Riki can escape.

Yuiko runs away with Riki, saying she didn’t really care if she got caught, but she’s not going to waste a chance given to her by a friend. She brings Riki to the broadcasting room, since she’s a member of the broadcasting club. Riki gets dejà vu again, seeing himself in that room, being hugged by Yuiko, and lots of other things. He then passes out from his narcolepsy.

I’m still pretty “Eh whatever” on the drama parts, but Little Busters still has the ability to make me laugh, and Yuiko was cool and scary during the scene where she faced down the mean girls. She’s such a not Key-like character—she reminds me of a Nisio Isin character, actually. His characters are usually a lot more arrogant, though, and Yuiko, although sometimes selfish, is hardly ever arrogant. (She was a little bit during that scene—when the lead mean girl stutters, she says “What language is that? I don’t understand it. Say it in one of the seven that I do.”) Even around Masato during their first meeting, Yuiko was reasonably unassuming, although she’s very imperious towards Riki. She has the aloof genius attribute similar to Kotomi, but unlike Kotomi, who was childlike and borderline autistic, allowing her to charm others, Yuiko is someone who could be hard to be around. (Even Riki has thought she was hard to be around, like when she forced him to come to their girly sleepover.) That seems to be why she gained the ire of the mean girls.

I’ve been reading a bit about the visual novel, and it seems that Yuiko’s story had a pretty strong romance component. So far, no one’s had a romance story except Komari, and that whole thing kind of evaporated after her story ended (which, of course, is because in the visual novel, the whole story ended when her route was over). But Rin is the main heroine, and apparently she has a romance with Riki too, so whatever happens with Yuiko will have to also dry up after her story is over. 

With Yuuichi and Tomoya, it was usually pretty easy to see their relationships with the girls turn into romance, but it’s harder to see with Riki, because he’s just not the same kind of hero. For instance, it’s really hard to see his relationship with Kud as a romance. Traditional Key heroines were always kind of antiromantic anyway,  because of their neotenic looks (word of the day) and waifish personalities, and Kud fits into that tradition. (She even has a catchphrase, /Wafu~!/, like Ayu. That seems to be where the spinoff’s title, /Kud Wafter/, comes from.) With Yuiko it’s the opposite problem—although I can easily imagine her in a romance, it’s hard to imagine her in a normal romance with a boy her own age. She seems like the type to have unconventional romances. (Her maturity and bisexuality are certainly the contributing factors.) Although in her case, it’s actually easier to see her with Riki than with someone like Kengo or Kyousuke because I imagine her wanting to be the dominant partner, and Riki seems like he would be the submissive partner in that relationship (as he also is in their friendship). 

Apparently, in the visual novel, Kyousuke wants to be called “Onii-chan” by Rin, but she won’t. (Way to go from highbrow to lowbrow in five seconds.)
** Refrain Episodes 2, 3, 4, 5<2014-11-22 Sat>
The Yuiko plot ends not with a bang but a whimper. Riki realizes time is repeating, only sometimes there’s a fireworks show at the end of the day (planned by Kyousuke with some mysterious foreknowledge that the rain will clear by evening) and sometimes there isn’t. Riki spends the first repetition of the fireworks show cuddling with Yuiko, and ends by discovering that Yuiko knows time is repeating and that she may have caused it. She tells him she had fun, then disappears. Riki wakes up the next morning and finds that Yuiko’s not in class.

Riki spends very little time worrying about that, as a girl named Suginami, who is weirdly caught up in all these events and is totally voiced by Kana Hanazawa, confesses to him. (She walked up and handed him a field trip information brochure just as Riki was wondering how Kyousuke knew things ahead of time, distracting Riki; she was the girl who stood by while her friends put tacks in Kudryavka’s bag to punish Kud for getting close to Yuiko; and now she confesses to Riki, setting off a sequence of events which was apparently planned out by Kyousuke in advance, as we see in the next few episodes.) Suginami says she likes Riki, but she knows he has someone else he likes, and runs away. Riki doesn’t know who she’s talking about until he realizes she meant Rin, since they’re always together. Riki hears from Kyousuke that Rin was confessed to by a third year a few months back, and she was so unfit to handle it that Kyousuke ended up rejecting him for her. (Other than complimenting her cooking, that’s the first oniichan-like thing we’ve seen him do.) 

Rin finds Riki and makes him go to town with her and carry back huge bags of canned cat food. (Rin carries just as much as Riki does, though; she’s not a tsundere, after all.) Riki and Rin talk about their confessions and Rin says she and Riki should just go out, which Riki agrees to.

Rin receives her final task, tied to the tail of her cat, Lennon. The note says to volunteer herself in homeroom. The teacher announces that they need two students, a boy and a girl, to give a tour to some district bigwigs. Rin and Riki volunteer, but Rin is too nervous, so Riki does most of the talking. Later, the teachers call Rin up to talk. They tell her that another school just suffered a terrible accident where a bunch of students died in bus crash, and the district  wants to import some students to liven things up and help them over the grief. The district bigwigs took a liking to Rin and asked for her. Rin can’t bring herself to tell Riki, so Kyousuke does. Riki doesn’t want Rin to go, but Rin says she’s thinking about it. Riki throws a fit, but Kyousuke convinces him to let Rin go. Rin also has a talk with Komari, who tells Rin they’re friends no matter what Rin does. Rin decides to go after Riki says he’s okay with it.

Riki gets suspicious of Kyousuke and realizes all those notes were sent by him and that their purpose was to put Rin through trials that would force her to mature and get over her shyness. He confronts Kyousuke, who doesn’t give him a straight answer, and their meeting is broken up by teachers finding them on the grounds after dark.

I’m disappointed in how the Yuiko story ended up, and how no one has noticed that she’s gone. Mio, Haruka, and Kud also disappeared, and no one has apparently noticed that they’re gone either, even though Rin and Komari live in the same dorm and Komari used to hang out with Kud a lot. Also, Kanata is Kud’s roommate and Haruka’s sister, so she would have noticed immediately if they were gone, but she hasn’t said anything. I imagine this is meant to smooth over something that was in the visual novel and couldn’t be done the same way because of how the stories are all merged, but it feels very clumsy.  

The commenters keep saying how the end justifies everything and how the series is just as good as Clannad in retrospect, but I’m watching Clannad right now and there’s no way Little Busters is as good as Clannad. It’s good, no doubt about it, but Clannad is just unbeatable. I just watched Nagisa’s play, where Akio busts in to make a big speech about how he and Sanae made her dreams into their, and afterward when Tomoya asks her to go out with him, and those scenes are still just as powerful as the first time, even though I’ve seen the show three or four times. All the most powerful scenes—Fuuko’s final moments at her sister’s wedding, Kotomi receiving the case from her parents, Kyou and Ryou sobbing together at the tennis game as they realize that they’ve both lost Tomoya to Nagisa, the final scene where Akio helps Nagisa over her guilt that she made him quit acting—all are still just as moving as the first time I saw them. And the comedy scenes are still hilariou. Little Busters doesn’t have anything like that. Its comedy scenes are pretty good, as good as Clannad or just a little before, but its emotional scenes don’t even compare. While it is better than most visual novel-derived Clannad wannabes, it’s not as good as Clannad, and nothing can make it so. It’s not even as good as Kanon, although it could still potentially reach that level, even though it will never completely get over the clumsy writing that we’ve seen so far. It is better than Air (which I keep meaning to watch again, although I don’t think I’ll discover it was as good as Little Busters). But Clannad just can’t be beaten. I put it third in my top five, after only the Monogatari Series and Aria, and I kind of wonder if it should’ve been higher.
** The rest of Refrain, <2014-12-01 Mon>
I was hoping Refrain would turn out to be really cool and make me regret quitting Little Busters before, but unfortunately, it got rid of everything that was good from Series I and we got a kind of boring drama. I almost didn’t even watch the last two episodes because I was so not looking forward to them, since I already had some idea what was going to happen and I knew it wasn’t going to redeem the show. 

After Rin goes to the other school, she slowly falls apart, and Riki begs Kyousuke to let her come back. Kyousuke won’t, but he lets her come back on weekends. Rin is depressed and won’t get out of bed the whole time (she’s actually in Riki’s bed, erotic). Riki ends up proposing that they run away. They do, but are caught and dragged back. They forget everything that’s happened and time resets again. The Little Busters start to fracture as Riki suspects everyone except he and Rin know some secret and Riki opposes Kyousuke’s plot. Kengo sides with Riki, while Masato, who turns out to be not as dumb as we thought, sides with Kyousuke. They try to defeat Kyousuke at baseball, but Kyousuke uses psychic powers to make Kengo think of Koshiro and distract him so he loses, infuriating Kengo.

After that, time resets again and Riki starts trying to reunite the Little Busters, who are falling apart. He asks Rin how Kyousuke collected them when he was a kid. First they get Masato to rejoin, then Kengo, and then Kyousuke comes out of his room, where he sits all day reading manga under a blanket, and joins them for a baseball game. Masato and Kengo disappear, and Kyousuke reveals that they’re in an artificial world. There was a bus crash, and everyone was horribly injured except for Rin and Riki, who were saved by Masato and Kengo respectively. Kyousuke used his dying will to create the artificial world so he could teach Rin and Riki how to survive without him. He also brought in the girls, who were also on the bus but weren’t their friends at that time, since they all had regrets and issues to resolve. (But how was Mio there, since she was intent on disappearing?)

Back in the real world, Riki and Rin save everyone from the flaming wreckage of the bus. Kyousuke rents a van and they drive to the beach to have fun, but no one wears a bikini, not even Yuiko.

I was massively disappointed in this ending. It was sort of a Gainax ending with no real emotional payoff. Not that I was ever in love with this show, but the humor was decent, and at least the Komari and Mio and Haruka stories were pretty emotional, and at least the Kud story showed Kud naked a lot and had Russian; Refrain wasn’t really emotional (because stuff just kept happening for no apparent reason, so there was no emotional context), and there was no naked Kud (because there was no Kud at all) or other lolis. Masato and Kengo started to just get weird in the last few episodes, and weirdly, the whole thing was more like the Masato/Kengo/Kyousuke route than the Rin route; Rin barely appeared, barely spoke, and barely did anything. I could have stood this story being all shounen ai if it were at least /good/, but it wasn’t, not really. Even though Ano Hana was also nowhere near as good as Clannad, I do still think it’s valid to say that Ano Hana is more like what Little Busters should have been. At least, it’s certainly more like what Refrain should have been, focusing on the core group of friends as it does.  

And that final scene! They go the beach. No one ever talked about wanting to go to the beach, so that had no emotional resonance at all. It just happened for no reason, like everything else in Refrain. 

I kind of think someone’s death (maybe Kyousuke’s) would have improved this, except actually no, because it was so without resonance or context that just killing of Kyousuke wouldn’t have done any good. 

Anyway, it wasn’t very good. I’m disappointed. I’m going to try and find something funny without much plot next (alongside Fate Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works), because the drama in the last few shows I’ve watched (this and Hanayamata)  has been so damn disappointing. I’m looking at Love Live (I heard it was much better than most idol anime), Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai 2, Hyouka, or Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou. I’m also considering finishing Kyoukai no Kanata, although that’s a bit too similar to Fate/Stay Night. Just as long as it doesn’t have drama, because god, I can’t take any more disappointing drama. Also, Komari’s voice is really annoying. Natsumi Yanase just has an annoying voice. I don’t want to pick on poor Komari because she’s a decent character, but Natsumi Yanase is just annoying. She’s not a good find like Sora Amamiya (Kaori Fujimiya) or Reina Ueda (Naru Sekiya). She’s just nasal and sounds like she has a cold.
