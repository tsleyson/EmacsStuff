* Thoughts on Ano Natsu de Matteiru
** <2015-02-12 Thu>, Episodes 1 - 4
After the horrible disappointment of B Gata H Kei, which I didn’t even finish watching, I moved on to the next show I’d bought, Ano Natsu de Matteiru, hoping it wouldn’t be horrible. This show had the deck stacked against it pretty high from the beginning, because not only was I in a mood to hate from B Gata H Kei, I had also just finished watching Madoka, a freaking top five grade show that I might just have to put in my top five in place of K-On or Haganai in the near future. Not much was going to compare to Madoka.

But Ano Natsu de Matteiru is pretty good. It’s no Madoka, but it’s at least as good as Asobi ni Iku yo so far, if not a bit better. 

The main character, Kirishima Kaito, likes to carry around an 8mm camera and film things, so his buddy, Ishigaki Tetsuro, suggests they spend summer vacation making a movie. Their two female friends, Kitahara Mio and Tanigawa Kanna, agree to take part. Kaito, with Tetsuro’s help, also ends up recruiting mysterious hot transfer student Takatsuki Ichika and her new loli friend Remon Yamano.

Ichika is actually an alien; in the first scene, she crashed in the river where Kaito was filming and somehow injured him, although he doesn’t have any memories of it except a vague sense that he’s met Ichika somewhere. After school, Kaito finds Ichika sitting on her suitcase and trying to fish from the river. He infers that she has nowhere to stay and invites her to stay over for one night, but a mysterious light surrounds him and renders him unconscious. Ichika comes out of the bath and has to kiss him on the forehead where some mysterious alien thing is happening; of course, Kaito’s older sister Nanami, who raised him, and Kanna, who has a crush on him, come in and see naked Ichika embracing him.

Nanami is going on a business trip soon, and she was worried about Kaito being alone; after she hears about Ichika’s situation, she invites Ichika to stay and take care of Kaito while she’s gone. Kaito soon realizes he has a crush on Ichika; after a movie-planning party where Remon gets everyone drunk with mysterious green liquid, he tries to confess to her in the wake of another attack of mysterious light, but Ichika stops him and tells him not to say anything. Both of them spend a day agonizing; Kaito thinks Ichika knew what he was going to say and stopped him because she doesn’t like him and didn’t want to hear it, while Ichika is afraid that Kaito knows she’s an alien, and she stopped him so he couldn’t call for the Men in Black to come get her. 

Kaito stays home from school; Kanna goes to visit him and make sure he’s all right, and Kaito invites her to go out since he’s afraid of Ichika coming home and finding them together. Kaito and Kanna hang out together on something vaguely like a date while Tetsuro, Mio, and Remon follow them and take film. Remon ruins things by popping up and making Kaito run off. Kaito runs into Ichika and they end up smoothing out the whole misunderstanding. 

However, another misunderstanding results when Kaito admits to Ichika that there’s someone he likes; Ichika first asks if it’s Kanna, then Mio, then jokingly asks if it’s her. Kaito doesn’t answer, even though he immediately denied it was Kanna or Mio. Ichika is so shocked that she gets on the train and runs off before Kaito can say anything. 

Kaito consults Tetsuro, asking in hypothetical terms what this sort of reaction could mean. Tetsuro says it means she was shocked, but it isn’t clear whether she was
