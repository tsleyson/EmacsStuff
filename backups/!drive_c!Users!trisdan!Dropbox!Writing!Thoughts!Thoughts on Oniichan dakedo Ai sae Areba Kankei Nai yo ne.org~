* Thoughts on Oniichan dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankei Nai yo ne!, <2014-04-24 Thu>
I bought this series basically because it was cheap and sounded like fun. It's based on a manga which I had read a few chapters of. The anime dispenses with all that boring story that occupied the first ten chapters of the manga, and skips straight to the harem situation.

Himenokouji Akiko is a brocon who's obsessively in love with her oniichan, Himenokouji Akito. They've been apart for the past six years, so they (according to one of the other characters) missed the critical period where Akiko would have learned that she can't be a brocon and stopped being in love with her brother. As such, Akiko is unduly excited about their new life together and keeps trying to get Akito to have sex with her.

In the manga, this is all made a little bit more clear: the Himenokouji family is implied to be quite rich and powerful, but Akito and Akiko are its last remaining members and were, for whatever reason, split up among two related families during their childhood: the Arisugawas took Akiko, while the Takanomiyas took Akito. Akito came up from Kyoto to live with Akiko after he was able to find a job writing terrible siscon romance novels thanks to his friend Ginbe, and make the money needed to set up a house for them. 

Akito also begins attending Akiko's school, St. Liliana's Academy, which is just like you'd expect. While there, he meets Nikaido Arashi, the eyepatch-wearing, sword-wielding, bisexual, eternally horny student council president; and Anastasia Nasuhara, who is a weirdo and is also horny a lot. (I feel that Anastasia was intended as a ripoff of Hitagi Senjogahara, since she has the same quiet, flat, emotionless voice and a somewhat similar sense of humor. Her favorite joke is to tell Akito to call her "Ana" for short, and when he does, say "My, calling a woman a hole like that.") Of course, Arashi and Anastasia and Ginbe, a flat-chested and boyish bokukko (but with a domestic streak), end up living with Akiko and Akito. This hasn't happened yet in the manga, but the anime begins with it already in place. (I feel that many recent anime assume you're already familiar with the source materials and just start off in the middle, without even a lame flashback to explain things.) In the anime they live in a dormitory; it's unclear whether this is true in the manga. I always had the impression that they were living in a private house somewhere.

Even though there's a somewhat interesting background there, the anime cuts all that out, and basically has no story at all. It doesn't even include the scenes where Akito first meets Arashi and Anastasia. In fact, when I watched the first few episodes, I was sort of wondering whether I'd made a grave mistake in purchasing it. But it ended up being not that bad. It's sort of like Haganai in a more Love Hina-ish direction. Arashi and Anastasia are constantly coming on to Akito, but it actually doesn't bother me that much because the show doesn't really focus on it, and because we see that those two are perverts who will come on to almost anything, man or woman. They probably just find Akito uniquely suited for coming on to because he already has to deal with Akiko, so he's not going to freak out when they join in. (In Anastasia's case it might just be obliviousness.) 

Arashi says in the manga that she's bi in the very beginning, and says that she's already been slobbering over Akiko for a while before Akito ever showed up. She also comes on to Ginbe and Anastasia. In one episode, Akito's editor, Jinno Kaoruko, starts to wonder if he's a siscon in real life, due to discovering that a) He really has a little sister; b) He gets a gentle, loving expression on his face when he talks about her; c) He has an action shot of her in his wallet; d) She's really cute. Jinno first tries to seduce him for some reason, then goes to the house to find out if he's a siscon. Arashi comes on to her and fantasizes about having sex with her. When she asks them straight out if he's a siscon, Arashi, Anastasia, and Ginbe all say yes immediately, without hesitation. Even though Akito always resists Akiko's attempts to have sex with him, the fact that he indulges her so much suggests they they're right.

As a result of this realization, the other three suggest that it might be a good idea if the two of them stop living in the same room. (It's more of a suite; it's a big Japanese-style room with a screen between the two sides. It's meant for the building manager, but Akito has been doing all the building manger duties.) Arashi says they won't force them, but thinks it might be a good idea; Akito immediately agrees, to Akiko's disappointment. Arashi finds a real manager for the building. Everyone is disappointed because they all have different requirements for their ideal manager: Ginbe wants someone serious and hardworking, Akiko wants a woman, and Anastasia wants a child, or an adult who's a paedomorphic loli. Arashi announces that by complete coincidence, the person she found fits all of those. It turns out she hired Takanomiya Alisa, the child of the family Akito was staying with, who is twelve years old, cute, hardworking, and serious, having completed some kind of thesis at the age of twelve. Anastasia immediately starts to fantasize about having sex with Alisa, proving that she's a lesbian loli rapist or something. 

The series isn't great by any measure. The art in the manga is pretty good; the art in the anime is pretty good too, although there's some pretty skimpy animation going on. The music is okay. The voice acting is decent, although I've never heard of any of the actors except for Eri Kitamura, who voices Arashi, and I can't even recognize her voice in it. (Although she does sound like Henneko's Tsutsukakushi Tsukushi, voiced by Yukari Tamura.) But it's fun, kind of like Koharu Biyori, except with a bit more of a light novel-y feeling. Things are less wacky and a bit more down-to-earth, and the jokes are a little more in dialogue and character and less in situations and misunderstandings. 

Among the characters, I like Akiko, although she's kind of underdeveloped. I like how her refined, princessy appearance belies her insanity. I also like Ginbe. I like silver hair and green eyes, and she's got both (I like Daenerys in the Game of Thrones TV show for her silver hair, too, and Nyaruko-san as well). Her boyish voice is pleasantly scratchy, a little bit like Ai Nonaka. I like how even though she likes Akito too, she never resorts to stripping or rape like the others. Instead, she does subtle things, like putting on a cute outfit for when they have tea in her room together (in Episode 3, and I especially like her ribbon) and gathering information about what kind of girl he likes casually, in the context of a conversation. There was some inconsistency with her in the manga; when she and Akito talk on the phone, she comes off as much more emotional and sarcastic than she does in the anime. Probably she's more like she is in the anime during the later parts of the manga. 

Unfortunately for Ginbe, she seems to be trapped in "best friend" territory. Akito has also made it clear that he's not into incest with Akiko. And in Episode 7, when Akiko spends the whole episode fighting with Alisa (who declares herself Akito's fianc√©e upon arrival), Akito ends the episode by telling both of them that as far as he's concerned, they're both his sisters and thus can never be romantic interests. Akiko and Alisa team up over this and form an alliance dedicated to inducing Akito to incest, real or virtual.

Arashi and Anastasia are pretty fun characters too, even if they're totally absurd. I kind of like that the series doesn't even pretend to have a story, because when series that don't really have stories pretend to have them, it can get tedious and boring (e.g. Hand Maid May). If they do decide to go further with the characterization, I hope to find out more about Akiko and Ginbe. 

* June 1st, 2014, on the Conclusion
The show has no story to the bitter end...almost, because at the bitter end, Akito reveals that he and Akiko aren't related by blood in voiceover, saying he can never tell her because she'll become even more insane.

I ended up liking Gin-Gin the most, although by the end she was just one of the me-too love interests that would always pipe up to agree with whatever romantic plots Akiko or Arashi came up with. In one episode we see how she and Akito met, which was kind of interesting. She used to be a tomboy in elementary school, and wore a boys' uniform. She was also angry and friendless, and determined to stay that way. Akito somehow had a premonition that they must be friends, and kept bugging her until she agreed to be his friend, at which time he discovered she was a girl when she wouldn't go in the bath with him and he forcefully stripped her. 

There was also an episode where Anastasia has no panties because they're all in the wash, so she just doesn't wear any, figuring it'll be fine. The whole group ends up walking around in the woods at night with a chill wind blowing, and Anastasia keeps on having to hold her skirt down and gets embarrassed, to the confusion of everyone else. Rather than strand her alone with Akito so he can discover that she's not wearing panties and get an eyefull, the writers instead strand her with Akiko, where she remembers having a lesbian crush on Akiko when they were younger and how great she thought Akito would be based on everything Akiko said about him.

The show pretty much ended as it began. It was okay, but I kind of regret spending money on it.
