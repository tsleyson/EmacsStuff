* Thoughts on Ore Imo:

** Thoughts on Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai pursuant to viewing of the Eleventh Episode (Thursday December 30 2010):

I just finished watching the eleventh and penultimate episode of Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai and thought now might be a good time to record some thoughts on it and the series in general.

OreImo, as it's known to those who wish to put off developing carpal tunnel for a few more years, follows Kyosuke Kousaka, a high school student who just wants to lead a normal life, and his younger sister Kirino Kousaka, a middle school student who appears perfect on the outside but is secretly an otaku. At the start of the series, she hates Kyosuke for some reason. We're not told why or whose fault it is; Kyosuke seems to think it's because she looks down on him for being merely average where she is exceptional, but there are a few indications that she has deeper reasons for her feelings at the beginning. In any case, Kirino happens to run in to Kyosuke and drops a DVD case for a magical girl series, which Kyosuke finds has an erotic game hidden inside it. He tricks Kirino into revealing that the case and the disk inside belong to her. When Kirino asks if he thinks she's weird for having such a thing, Kyosuke says that he doesn't and Kirino decides to take him into her confidence, showing him her mountains of anime DVDs, figures, and erotic games about brothers and sisters falling in love, which she keeps in a hidden closet behind her dresser. Knowing their father wouldn't approve, Kyosuke offers to help her if she ever needs it; Kirino takes this differently than he meant it and forces him to play erotic games so she has someone to talk about them with.

The series most similar to OreImo is probably Genshiken, but where Genshiken used fairly realistic character designs and showed how truly inglorious it is to be an otaku, OreImo casts cute girls as otaku and limits the creepy men to the background. The series also made its protagonist, cute middle school girl and model Kirino Kousaka, a fan of male-oriented little sister love games and magical girl anime instead of the yaoi that the Genshiken girls drooled over.

I don't point this out as a minus. While I liked Genshiken, it doesn't bother me at all that OreImo is rooted in a fantasy world that cannot exist without assuming some very dark psychological hangups on the part of the main cast. The treatment of the material manages to be light and fun while also being deep, and leaves any latent darkness by the wayside. As of episode eleven, we're never told why Kyosuke and Kirino were estranged at the beginning of the series, but a few scenes suggest that Kyosuke has some reason to feel guilty, which he tries to make up for by helping Kirino with her otaku habits. Kyosuke helps Kirino find new otaku friends, helps her keep otaku-hating old friends, and negotiates their father into letting her keep her hobby when he does find out about it. Almost once per episode, Kyosuke has to take some sort of bullet for Kirino; when their father decides that Kirino can keep the magical girl DVDs but has to get rid of the erotic games, Kyosuke stands up for her by pretending the games belong to him, and taking a beating from his father for playing games about loving little sisters on his little sister's computer. He also faces abuse from Kirino herself, who never shows any gratitude at all for everything he does for her, and reacts violently whenever he brings up how strange it is that she wants to play little sister-love games with her brother. In his monologues, Kyosuke claims he does this for her without expecting any gratitude just because she's his little sister, which seems a little incredible, and not very interesting. 

But as the series progresses, Kirino seems to realize what Kyosuke does for her. The turning point is episode 9, when everybody spends a day sitting around at home. Kirino is absorbed in the erotic game she just received, which has a tsundere-type character that spends the beginning of the game insulting the protagonist. Kirino is unsatisfied with the game because of the character's verbal abuse and finds herself yelling back at it, until she reaches the end, when the character starts to become gentle. Later, she goes off on Kyosuke after he makes a harmless comment and finds herself yelling the same sorts of things at him as the character in the game had been, then seems to realize what she's doing. In episode 11, Kyosuke's childhood friend Manami, who Kirino derisively calls Jimiko ("plain girl"), comes to cook and clean for the two while their parents are away. Kirino does her best to embarrass Kyosuke in front of her by spreading porn magazines over the bed and putting her laptop, with the sex scene from an erotic game on the screen, on his desk. Manami is embarrassed but not put out and manages to cook and clean well enough to foil Kirino's plot to pick her apart, but Kyosuke finally gets mad at Kirino. In the second half of the episode, Kirino and her two otaku friends (both cute girls, of course, though one of them dresses to hide it) throw Kyosuke a surprise party, at the end of which Kirino gives Kyosuke a present and finally thanks him for everything he's done for her. Tellingly, the present is the same erotic game that Kirino was playing in episode 9.

A lot of the discussion I've read of the series concentrated on how unlikeable Kirino was as a heroine, but I didn't feel she showed a really ugly side until she started harassing Manami, who was nothing but friendly to her. Throughout the series, Kirino gets angry at Kyosuke for spending time with other girls, including her friends, which suggests that she's always wanted attention from him and is fierce in retaining it now that she has it. Her love for little sister-love games also seems to indicate that she wanted attention from Kyosuke, but couldn't get it, and became angry and snubbed him, and now lives inside games that show close brother-sister relationships. But the series never suggests in seriousness that Kirino has romantic feelings for Kyosuke; it seems she just wanted him to dote on her by spending time with her and buying things for her, as she forces him to do in episode 7. 

Kyosuke and Kirino's relationship is the central focus of the series, but the series also spends some time with several minor characters. The ones I enjoyed watching most were Kirino's normal friend Ayase, who works with her as a model, and her otaku friend Kuroneko, whose real name, to my knowledge, is not mentioned in the series. Ayase first becomes aware of Kirino's otaku hobbies when she happens to run in to Kirino coming out of the Summer Comic Fest and accidentally tears open a bag of doujinshi. At first she is repulsed by Kirino's hobby because she saw a news story about a crazed man who kidnapped and hurt a girl and claimed he did it because of erotic games, but Kyosuke digs up evidence to refute this claim. Early on, it seemed as if Ayase and Kyosuke might end up having some kind of association, but in order to save her friendship with Kirino, Kyosuke claims to be the one who introduced Kirino to otaku hobbies and pretends to have a sister complex, earning Ayase's disgust. In her two major appearances, episode 5 and episode 10, Ayase shows some signs of being homicidal, manipulative, and Machiavellian, despite her innocuous appearance. At the beginning of episode 5, when she realizes Kirino has been trying to cover up her attendance of the Comic Market, Ayase intimates that she will do something bad to Kirino for lying to her, because she hates being lied to. The main plot of episode 10 involves Ayase tricking and manipulating her and Kirino's other friend Kanako, who resembles Kirino's favorite anime character Meruru, into entering and winning a cosplay contest for Ayase's benefit. If the series had gone in a different direction, Ayase could have been a psychotic killer in the style of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni.

Kuroneko first appears in episode 2 at Saori's otaku meet-up; since neither she nor Kirino had spoken much during the meeting, Saori invites them to a restaurant afterwards to get to know them. Kirino and Kuroneko immediately start fighting because of their differing tastes in anime; Kirino enjoys the magical girl show Stardust Witch Meruru, heavily influenced by Nanoha, while Kuroneko prefers Maschera, which seems to be a riff on X. Each finds the other's choice intolerable. Whenever around Kirino or doing any kind of otaku activity, Kuroneko wears a gothic lolita dress with plenty of black lace and ruffles and talks frequently about darkness and black magic, but in episode 9, we see her at home, dressed in a jogging suit and taking care of her little sister (which Kirino envies her for having), having to moderate her strangeness for her sister's benefit. That and her growing friendship with Kyosuke, who starts to talk to her without Kirino's involvement, made her a fun character to watch. I particularly liked episode 7, when Kuroneko and Kyosuke have a conversation about the finer points of novel writing, and episode 9, when Kyosuke calls Kuroneko for no reason and admits he's just wasting time so he doesn't have to study. Also, in episode 11, Kyosuke is underwhelmed at the sight of Saori and Kirino in maid outfits and says to Saori that "It's just you and my sister", but then asks where Kuroneko is; after Kirino drags her out from behind the curtains, Kyosuke seems to enjoy seeing her in the maid outfit.

As much as I enjoyed the series, it did have a few trouble spots, most of them involving episode 8, where the novel that Kirino wrote, which was miraculously picked up for publication, is miraculously picked up for adaptation into an anime. Even though I accept the essential unreality of the series, I felt like this plot pushed the lack of realism a bit too far. I also didn't like the way the episode played out, with the evil executive that treats anime as a business being overruled by Kyosuke's and Kuroneko's inspirational speeches. I found it tedious, nowhere near as much fun as the rest of the series, but I was able to forgive the series for it because the episodes that came before and after it were so much fun. I hope to see a US release on DVD, and maybe if that were to sell well, we would see a release of the light novels.

Thoughts on Episode 12 (Good End) of OreImo written two days after viewing (Tuesday January 4th 2011)

I just saw (most of) Episode 12 the other day and decided to write some thoughts on it.

Episode 11 ended with Kirino finally thanking Kyosuke for putting up with all her crap and giving him a copy of the erogame that (we may assume) prompted her to realize how badly she treats him. At the start of Episode 12, Kirino seems transformed; she serves breakfast to everyone, including Kyosuke, and speaks to him somewhat politely. Kyosuke even complains that that isn't his sister, since she would never act like that.

Several episodes ago, Kirino claimed that she would ask for "life counseling" from Kyosuke only one more time, and that would be the end. In this episode she calls in this favor and asks Kyosuke to buy her an erogame at a midnight sale in Akihabara so she doesn't have to wait for it to arrive by mail order. The two come up with a complicated plan to make sure their parents don't find out what he's doing; as part of this, Kyosuke claims to be sleeping over at a friend's house and asks the friend to cover for him if anyone calls (he tells the friend he's sneaking off to see Manami). This leads to a fun scene where Kyosuke goes to the sale and finds the friend he claimed to be staying with lining up for erogames. His friend, however, is buying a game about macho gay men. When he claims that he's buying the game for his little sister, Kyosuke is about to tell him how ridiculous that story is when he realizes he's in the middle of the same situation and agrees to pretend they never met at the sale.

Kyosuke buys the game and sneaks back into the house with Kirino's help. When he goes to leave, however, Kirino asks him to stay and play the game with her, as they used to do before she found her otaku friends to talk to. Again, Kirino wants to spend time with Kyosuke, and now she feels a little more at ease asking him straight out instead of forcing him, though she still needs the excuse of the game. Kyosuke sits with her until early in the morning, watching her clear one route of the game. In the morning, Kirino asks Kyosuke for more life counseling and takes out a box with a notebook she intends to show him. Halfway through, seeing Kyosuke's reaction, Kirino decides she doesn't want to show him, but Kyosuke wants to see and tries to take the notebook. While they fight over it, a picture and a piece of paper fall out. The picture shows Kirino when she was younger, in her track uniform, and we finally see proof that she dyes her hair blonde. (In the first episode, during the very first scene, the version of Kirino in Kyosuke's dream has brown hair, but until now we never knew whether that was her actual color, and she dyed her hair blonde, or whether this was just Kyosuke's fantasy idea of a more normal sister.) The piece of  paper is a plane ticket to America, where Kirino has been invited for track training. She says that she'll be gone until she starts high school, which probably means about two years (Japanese middle schools include seventh, eighth, and ninth grades; since Kirino is fourteen, she's likely in seventh grade) and that her plane leaves the next morning. Kyosuke is at first dismayed and asks why she didn't tell him, but when Kirino gets angry and defensive and accuses him of always acting like she's a nuisance, Kyosuke gets mad in turn and tells her to go, since he doesn't care. The two start fighting and knock over the computer, with the ending scene of the erogame still up. [Watch the scene again to flesh this section out.] 

In this scene, Kirino comes close to revealing her true feelings for Kyosuke. She still doesn't seem to have any romantic intention; she seems to want only to hear that he enjoys spending time with her and that she isn't a nuisance for him. She wants him to say that he doesn't want her to go. For his part, Kyosuke seems taken aback that she did everything without telling him, and even offended that she would tell him the day before she leaves after everything they've been through. This is probably why he gets mad at Kirino instead of telling her what she wants to hear. But Kirino, with her erogame-addled brain, probably set things up this way to raise the drama and wring out what she wanted to hear; when things backfire and she doesn't get the reaction she wanted, she gets angry, and makes Kyosuke angry as well. In the end, Kirino doesn't leave. She didn't hear what she wanted from Kyosuke, so she stays to continue working on their relationship. 

This episode is the “Good” ending of the series. In the summer of 2011, an OAV will be released that shows the “True” ending. This structure follows the structure of erogames by, in particular, Type-Moon; the True ending is usually more complex and ambiguous than the Good ending, offering a bittersweet or somber conclusion to the story. It's probable that the True ending involves a lot more drama surrounding Kirino's decision to leave. I'll reserve judgment on the series' conclusion until seeing it, but because of this dual-ending structure, the conclusion of the Good ending came across as rather rushed. It built the relationship between Kyosuke and Kirino to a new level, but did not give any catharsis as Episode 11 did. Even so, it was a good episode that showcased several of the traits I've most appreciated about OreImo throughout; the complex character relationships, the sense of fun, and the avoidance of cliches.

** More Impressions after a Second Viewing of Episodes 1-4, written March 26th, 2011:

OreImo was just as much fun as I remembered, and I liked having the chance to watch it again. These early episodes were the ones that really focused on Kirino herself and her evolving challenges to hide her otaku side now that she has more association with the otaku lifestyle. They were also the ones when Kyosuke had to take the most abuse for the least gratitude. Somewhere down the line (Episode 6, I think), Kirino actually kicks Kyosuke in the crotch; she does her best to get that shot in Episode 4, while she and Kyosuke are fighting over a package she thinks is full of cosmetics, but which is actually full of doujinshi, that she was about to open in front of her two normal friends. Episode 4 was also Ayase's first appearance; in this episode, she came off as an easygoing, reasonable girl with a possible crush on Kyosuke, which helped set up her turn to darkness in Episode 5 and Episode 10.

The earlier episodes focused much less on the secondary characters; after watching them, I remembered why I didn't like Kuroneko when she first appeared. She acted too much like the rich, haughty rival in a more cliché-oriented show. I think the vague feeling that she was rich helped make Episode 9, where she is shown to live in a lower-middle class sort of house, that much funnier. Saori, on the other hand, seemed quite humble, with her hideous flannel shirt and crazy swirly glasses; when we see her later wearing a sun dress with servants waiting on her, it's a bit of a surprise.

One scene I had completely forgotten that I liked a lot was the scene in Episode 2 after Kirino attends Saori's otaku meet-up, when Kyosuke tells her that she intimidated the others by wearing the fancy clothes and jewelry that are available to her as a model and Kirino explains that dressing like that is a part of her as much as loving little sister erogames is. The scene (along with a few in Episode 4 and later) showed that the personality Kirino shows to the world isn't a lie; it's a real part of her, it's just not the whole picture. It's interesting that Kirino considers her otaku side and her normal side as equally important to making up her identity, in contrast to Genshiken, where most of the characters consider being an otaku their prime characteristic.

Even though obligations on my time have forced me to make the second viewing of OreImo an illegal one, I still intend to keep going and see it all over again (and maybe finally see the last few minutes of Episode 12).

** A quick comment on subtitling:

Now that I've seen all of Anime News Network's legal streaming version of OreImo, and several episodes of Mazui's illegal fansub, I'd like to make some comparisons between the two. 

In general, I would say that the ANN version actually feels more like a fansub than Mazui's, which mostly works in its favor. However, the first thing I noticed about the ANN version was how filled with typos it is. There was at least one typo per episode. I understand they were working on a tight schedule, but a little rereading can help this problem a lot. I haven't noticed any typos in the fansub. ANN also doesn't provide translations for a lot of the onscreen text, which can get annoying since there's quite a bit of it. I can read a bit of it, but only the least important parts, like the characters' names in the opening sequence. 

That's the negative side of the ANN version feeling like a fansub; the positive side is how completely their localization job blows away the fansub's. In particular, the fansub translates Kirino's derisive nickname for Manami, Jimiko, as "neighbour girl", which throws off the entire scene in Episode 4 when Kirino mentions her and Kyosuke says he doesn't like anyone insulting her but him. Apparently Kirino was somehow insulting Manami by calling her a neighbour. Also, since Manami does not actually live next-door to them, the title does not make any sense. This was a terrible translation for the word both as it relates to the story and as it relates to the way the word jimi is used in the Japanese language.

The fansub also completely ignores Saori's odd manner of speech, again poking holes in a scene where Kyosuke comments that Saori is a completely different person online. Saori uses the pronoun sessha and the verb form de gozaru, which are odd-sounding because they at once have connotations of respect and haughtiness. (The usual form is de gozaimasu, which is fully respectful.) They were originally used by samurai and are probably used by Saori for fun more than anything. The ANN version translated this quirk by using pseudo-Shakespearean 'thee' and 'thou' and the verb endings '-eth' and '-est', a good way of preserving the strange and old-fashioned impression given by the original Japanese. 

** Impressions on a Third Viewing (Legally this time), Thursday November 24th (Thanksgiving) 2011:

I bought the DVDs of OreImo. They were pretty expensive, though I got half-price from Right Stuf (sixty dollars) instead of paying $120 on Amazon, so it wasn't as bad as it could've been. Anyway, I figured I would give impressions on a third viewing because I have nothing better to do (except study for my final exams so I don't fail them all). Also, this set includes the four OVA episodes (the True ending and three bonus episodes, which seem to include a subplot I heard about from the novels where Kuroneko transfers to Kyosuke's school and the two of them eventually end up going out. This is probably what Kuroneko was alluding to in Episode 11 when Kirino asks why she's calling Kyosuke "Onii-chan" and Kuroneko says she'll find out soon.)

Anyway, I've watched Episodes 1 and 2 again and enjoyed them just as much as the first two times. Episode 1 really was an excellent opening for the series. I liked the first scene, when dream Kirino, with her hair its original color, comes in to wake up Kyosuke, telling him she made breakfast and will do his laundry, and Kyosuke explodes, knowing it's a dream. This was the closest Ayana Taketatsu ever came in this series to using her cuter Azu-nyan voice instead of her harsher Mio Isurugi voice.

Unlike the fansub version, the DVD version of Episode 1 includes the opening and the ending, using the song "Imouto Please" as the ending theme. I haven't verified yet whether the subtitle translation is the ANN translation or if the series was re-subtitled for this release, but it blows away the fansub translation. It's not nearly as literal, helping us get the subtext from a lot of scenes much better than the overly literal fansub; for example, when Kyosuke asks Kirino why she likes little sister love games, her response is translated something like "Don't you just look at this and think 'Awww'?"; not only was it a much more informative and articulate response to Kyosuke's question than the fansub answer of "Don't you just look at this and think it must be good?", it also felt a lot more true to the nature of being an otaku and loving such things that normal people don't see any attraction in. In Episode 2, Kirino's name Jimiko for Manami was translated as "Miss Plain", a much better rendition of the meaning of the Japanese, and one that makes Kyosuke's response "I don't like hearing other people say bad things about her" much more logical. One annoyance with the translation is that it still doesn't translate any of the background text.

As for the show itself, I noticed a lot more of Kirino slipping cuteness in between the cracks this time around. It's a lot easier to see her being tsundere than I remembered: it feels like she's actually excited and elated to have a reason to spend time with Kyosuke, but at the same time wants to punish him for being aloof for so long. The combative awkwardness of this dynamic is what makes it feel like they might have some kind of romantic relationship, but I still don't think that was intended to be the case; I still believe the show was subtly depicting the kind of awkwardness the two of them might feel about suddenly being close after always being distant. It's also possible that Kirino feels since she can be her true self around Kyosuke with regards to being an otaku, maybe she can also be herself in regards to being aggressive, irate, and prone to tantrums; she seems to act like this with only Kyosuke and Kuroneko, who both know about her being an otaku, being only pleasant to Ayase, her parents, and others. (She was a little irate to Saori in Episode 2 when she and Kuroneko insult Saori, but mostly I didn't remember a lot of deep interaction between Kirino and Saori, so I can't say much about that.)

I remembered after watching Episode 2 again why I initially didn't like Kuroneko. She does come off as the haughty, rich rival-type. Other than the gradual building of Kyosuke and Kirino's relationship, the series of steps Kuroneko took from being annoying to being my favorite character in the series was probably OreImo's most impressive piece of character building. As I remember it, she starts out annoying in Episode 2, then becomes a little more likeable in Episode 4, when we see her win the SisCaly tournament for Kirino and also see that she's pretty nice to Kyosuke despite him just being Kirino's brother; she advanced a lot in my esteem in Episode 7, when she's shown to have some literary talent, and (notwithstanding Episode 8), became my favorite in Episode 9, when we see her sitting around the house watching her sister, being down-to-earth, responsible, and caring, and also get the first hints of her relationship with Kyosuke developing. I don't know if she was my favorite character of the year, as somebody on the internet said in the usual forum posts under the announcement of the series release where everybody bitches that they refuse to buy that series at that price and it wasn't that good and blah blah, then either go download the fansubs or buy it anyway, but I did like her. I'll probably have more to say about Kuroneko as I watch more episodes of the series.

** Impressions on another viewing of Episodes 3, 4, and 5, from Sunday, November 27th, 2011:

Wow! I had no memory at all of Episode 3 being one of the best episodes in the series! This episode focuses mainly on the disaster of Kirino and Kyosuke's father finding out about Kirino's otaku hobby and being horrified. Kirino has a terrible habit of running into people and dropping DVD cases with erogames hidden in them. I wonder why she's always carrying around erogames anyway.

Anyway, this episode includes some very nice scenes of Kirino, Kuroneko, and Saori running around Akihabara together and having fun. It also drops some early hints that Kuroneko doesn't have a lot of money, with her saying she doesn't have any allowance to spend on Meruru and watching wistfully as Kirino compulsively spends huge amounts of money. But the finale is the focal point. After Kirino's father finds the erogame, he makes her mad by saying he's going to get rid of all her anime stuff and she runs off. Kyosuke chases her down beating a taiko drum game to death in an arcade and talks to her, then decides to confront their father on her behalf. 
[I like how Kyosuke is left in the dust by Kirino when he goes to chase after her. She's on the track team, so of course she'd be fast, but too many shows leave background details like that as informed attributes and completely forget them when a scene might be affected by them.]
Kyosuke has a bizarre strategy for dealing with people: he usually yells at and berates them in Kirino's favor, trying to break them down and force them into accepting his point of view, then achieving partial success and taking some huge bullet for Kirino just to sweep up the last vestiges of a problem. The first time I saw the series I didn't think much of his tactics—that is, it seemed like they only worked because of authorial fiat. I still don't think it's a very good way to go about things, but re-watching Episodes 3 and 5 has made it more clear how it actually works—it mostly operates because the other person wants to stay close to Kirino and is surprised that Kyosuke is defending Kirino so vigorously, and also invokes pity because Kyosuke is such an awful liar. In this case, he yells at their father, insisting that her anime hobby isn't worthless or degenerate, showing him a picture of her with Saori and Kuroneko that Saori sent him, and revealing that as much as their father complains about Kirino's modeling job, he keeps a secret album with clippings from when she appeared in magazines. Kyosuke's yelling finally convinces their father to relent on the DVDs and manga, but he won't let Kirino keep the erogames since they're for people over 18. Kyosuke was dreading this moment, knowing their father is right, so he uses his final attack of claiming the games are his, saying that he should be allowed to have such games since his mother has already accepted the porn magazines under his bed. Kyosuke rants and raves until his father punches him out to shut him up, having already yelled at him for the vileness of playing games about doing dirty things to your little sister in his little sister's room on his little sister's computer. This is the final part of Kyosuke's strategy: do something to make the other person so disgusted that they forget about Kirino in their shock. The first time I saw this scene, I took it at face value: I thought their father had believed Kyosuke's lie and was really just punching him out to end the raving and for playing sister-love games on his sister's computer. But this time, I realized that their father didn't punch Kyosuke after yelling at him for playing sister-love games on his sister's computer; it was a little afterwards, and then he said something like "Do whatever you want". That suggested that he actually knew full well that Kyosuke was lying, and was angry because Kyosuke covered for Kirino so she could keep her erogames, but didn't think he could actually call Kyosuke on the lie since Kyosuke would just keep insisting the games were his.

Actually, Kyosuke often tries to handle situations awkwardly or with force instead of using finesse. Several of the fights he gets in with Kirino aren't just because of her horrible temper; they're also because Kyosuke isn't delicate or sensitive enough about something. I first started noticing this the first time I watched Episode 12, during the scene when Kirino tells Kyosuke she's leaving for the US and clearly wants him to tell her not to go, but Kyosuke doesn't see it and ends up making her mad and causing a fight. In Episode 4, Ayase and Kanako come over and Kirino tries to make Kyosuke stay in his room so he can't see them. This is particularly unreasonable because he spends most of the day playing Siscalypse, a little sister fighting game, so that he can finish the main game and use his character to play against Kirino, since she can't beat anyone on the Internet and wants to smack him around. Kyosuke ends up finding Saori on the Internet and asking her for help, forming a friendship with her. (By the way, this was the scene were I finally noticed the major difference between Saori's manner of speech online and in person; online she uses extremely polite, obsequious language like a gracious princess, while in person she uses formal, but much more abrupt samurai-style language. Kyosuke notices this and comments that she's really a different person online.)

Anyway, Saori sends Kirino a bunch of doujinshi in a makeup company box (the makeup is apparently expensive and hard to get, an early hint of Saori's wealth), but she didn't know the kanji for Kirino's name, so she sent it to Kyosuke. Kirino comes down and takes the box, thinking it's full of makeup that she'd like to try out with her model friends, and Kyosuke receives a call from Saori explaining the situation and rushes upstairs to get the box away. Here he charges in and grabs the box, prompting Kirino's fury and causing her to chase him down the stairs, leading to a weak scene where, while fighting over the box with Kirino, Kyosuke somehow pulls up her skirt and her shirt and then falls on her with one hand in her crotch and another on her breast. I really wish OreImo wouldn't succumb to that sort of Love Hina-style crap. It was a scene that will live in infamy. This is also an instance where a little finesse on Kyosuke's part could've saved him a lot of trouble, as Kirino points out after he explains.

Before the box incident, there was a scene where Kyosuke is sitting in his room playing Siscaly and happens to hear Kirino and her friends through the wall talking about him. Ayase, who politely introduced herself upon seeing him in the living room, comments that she thought he looked kind and Kirino tells her she needs an eye exam. Then Kanako says he looked so boring that he'll probably end up as a company middle manager in ten years. Kyosuke makes a comment about foul-mouthed middle school girls and leaves the room, just missing the fact that Kirino doesn't emphatically agree but actually seems not to appreciate what Kanako said. It's as if Kirino doesn't want anyone else to insult Kyosuke, similar to how Kyosuke himself feels about Manami. Another example of her cute refusal to acknowledge how she feels about him.

Because of the box incident, Kirino forces Kyosuke to take her somewhere. With help from Saori, Kyosuke decides to take her to Summer Comic Market. Of course she loves it. When she discovers that the limited edition Siscaly extension disc she wanted is sold out, she enters a Siscaly contest against a seasoned player to win the last copy. Kirino and Saori both lose to him, but Kuroneko manages to win and, in an adorable scene, grudgingly gives her winnings to Kirino, who tries to pretend she doesn't want them. The first time I watched the show, Episode 7 was the pivot that made Kuroneko into my favorite character, but this scene really helped set up that pivot. It was too cute watching the two of them try to overcome their usual rivalry and share a moment of friendship.

There was also a scene I liked where Kirino suddenly gets into a good mood and starts talking about Kuroneko's outfit, telling her she should've worn something cooler and commenting that she'd be pretty cute if she'd give up all the darkness and paleness. (Actually, since Kirino likes little sisters and magical girls, the short and petite Kuroneko should be just her type. There should be a doujinshi about that. It's sad that yuri is so unappreciated as an art form that doujin artists add male characters into shows where there were none, like K-On; when there actually are male characters, the number of yuri doujins is unfortunately even smaller. Somebody probably drew Kirino and her father and Kirino and the evil anime director before thinking about drawing Kirino and Kuroneko.) Kirino takes off Kuroneko's jacket and makes Kyosuke carry it, leaving Kuroneko in just her slip and skirt. Then Kirino probably committed that sight to memory forever. [Maybe she snapped a picture on her cell phone when Kuroneko wasn't looking.]

(Actually, Kuroneko goes out with Kyosuke later in the novels, so there should be a doujin about a menage à trois between Kirino, Kyosuke, and Kuroneko. Get on that, doujin authors!)

The episode ends with Ayase running into them outside the building, putting Kirino in a terrible spot. Episode 5 picks up right here, and just when I thought was exaggerating all that Higurashi stuff I saw in Ayase on my first viewing, I saw it all over again. When Ayase grabs Kirino's wrist, accusing her of hiding something, and says that she hates being lied to, her pupils dilate and she looks like a straight psychopath. She also grabs Kirino's wrist so hard that Kirino flinches, and Ayase seems to realize what she was doing and lets go. It seems clear that Ayase has hidden yandere tendencies; I'm surprised the events at the conclusion of this episode didn't lead to her tying Kyosuke and Kirino up in her basement and bleeding them both to death one stab at a time while reminding them how much she hates being lied to. Poor Kuroneko and Saori have to take a bullet for Kirino here, being called part of "that creepy bunch", but Kyosuke almost has Ayase convinced that he and Kirino are just out together having fun before her training camp starts, until Kirino blows it and Ayase goes all Shion Sonozaki on her. 

After Kirino fails to make up with Ayase on the first day back to school, Kyosuke goes and gives what he probably thought was a very inspiring pep talk, but as usual he's too forceful and makes her mad. They start fighting and Kyosuke ends up getting kicked in the crotch, which Kirino tried to do in Episode 4, leading to the awful Love Hina scene. I won't say he deserved that (far from it), but he probably could've been more delicate in his wording. But it isn't just Kyosuke's wording; Kirino also gets mad and asks why he's trying to act like a brother now after ignoring her for all those years. Even on my first viewing, I wasn't obtuse enough to miss this line and the suggestion that Kirino always wanted to have a good relationship with Kyosuke and blames Kyosuke for not having it. Actually, based on what we've seen of their personalities, it seems likely that both of them wanted to have a good relationship, but at some point Kirino became "perfect", with her good looks, good grades, and sports skills, and Kyosuke felt distant from her because of either jealousy or an inferiority complex. (Episode 8 hints at a little jealousy from Kyosuke.) Then Kirino, being how she is, became angry at him for acting distant and scorned him, which just worsened Kyosuke's inferiority complex. She also seems to have felt like Kyosuke gave all his attention to Manami and didn't have any left for her, so she became even more angry and everything got to the point where it was in Episode 1. 

Kyosuke does the same thing with Ayase that he tried with his father, meeting her in the park and beating her down with facts about otaku and how they've been misrepresented in the media. He also tells her that Kirino really wants to make up. Kirino makes a pretty cool entrance from the top of the play structure and says she needs to handle the problem herself. When Ayase claims that otaku Kirino is a fake, Kirino starts listing features of the "real" Kirino and asks if Ayase thinks that's the real her. (She gets a little too enthusiastic listing all her positive attributes; Kyosuke was probably groaning off-screen.) She says that loving doujinshi and erogames is also part of the real her, but Ayase is just as important to her as erogames. Ayase for some reason is touched at being told she's as important as erogames (she seems touched to be told she's important to Kirino; maybe she's actually terribly insecure and her yandere side is part of her insecurity?), but she still refuses to accept Kirino's hobby. Kirino forces Kyosuke to intervene and save her, and Kyosuke, out of ideas, starts with the final stage of his master strategy: do something repulsive and yell a lot. He shows Ayase a Meruru doujinshi that he had with him for some reason; Ayase blushes and drops it, getting inflamed. Kyosuke makes a grand speech about how doujinshi and erogames brought him back together with his sister, uniting their broken bonds and so forth, and ends by screaming to the sky that he loves his sister. As over-the-top as the speech is, nothing in Kyosuke's wording particularly suggests he meant a romantic relationship, and it's true that he and Kirino became closer because of her being an otaku. Kirino doesn't seem to mind; she does try to object at one point, but Kyosuke takes her into his arms and covers her mouth, and she doesn't fight at all, even though we know she could do some major damage if she wanted to. When Ayase grabs her and runs away, saying she wants to make up and save Kirino from her perverted brother, Kirino seems too flustered to do anything but go along.

Later, Ayase sends Kyosuke a text message thanking him for his part in bringing her and Kirino back together, but says that if he ever does anything perverted to Kirino, she'll kill him. (I'm surprised she didn't kill him anyway.) She calls him "lying brother", so maybe Kyosuke was supposed to have suggested that he had a romantic relationship with Kirino and Ayase knew he was lying, but was touched by how hard he fought to bring her and Kirino back together. In this episode and Episode 4, it almost seemed like Ayase knew something about Kirino and Kyosuke's relationship. She seemed to like Kyosuke from the very beginning, even though she'd never seen him before. She is Kirino's best friend, so maybe Kirino told her some of her true feelings about wanting to have a better relationship with Kyosuke, and Ayase relented on her distaste for otaku because she realized that Kyosuke's rant had some truth to it. She had, after all, seen that Kirino and Kyosuke became closer recently. Also, this episode and Episode 10 suggest that despite her innocuous appearance, Ayase is actually a devious, scheming, homicidal maniac; if that's true, she must be smart enough to realize things like that.

(Even if I'm going too far by calling Ayase a devious homicidal maniac, it makes the show more fun to watch if I believe that she is. Plus, there is evidence for it. Maybe she wouldn't have actually killed Kirino at the beginning of Episode 5, but she was definitely getting ready to freak out. And she did do a job on Kanako in Episode 10; Kanako may not have been harmed, but she was tricked so completely that she would've been in real trouble if Ayase's objective was to harm her.)

These three episodes were some of the best in the entire series, and every time I watch them I notice new details that add to my understanding of the characters and the plot. Maybe the ANN snobs just need to watch the series a few more times to appreciate the depth?

** Thoughts on Episodes 6 and 7, written Tuesday, November 29th, 2011:

As an addendum to my comments on Ayase's intelligence last time, I realized that she's a junior high school girl who watches the news. She must be at least a little intelligent.

Anyway, Episode 7 was where I felt like the series really got going the first time I watched it. Episode 6 felt like a nice rest from Kirino's constant nagging; I sympathized with Kyosuke's relaxation at Manami's house. This time I didn't like it as much. It's probably because I'm progressing further into otaku insanity, sympathizing with Kirino, and losing all perspective. Call me crazy, but she somehow seems much cuter than she did the first couple times I watched the show. Manami's family was pretty entertaining, though, and the episode showed a little more of the fault that Kyosuke holds for his and Kirino's bad relationship. Kyosuke is very close with Manami's family; her grandparents push them to get married, he jokes around with her brother, and he helps her parents in their shop. The first time I watched the show, I liked seeing a place where Kyosuke was appreciated; his own parents seem to like Kirino better, with his mother mocking and belittling him and his father thinking of him as worthless. As for Kirino herself, it's very complicated. (So complicated that the whole series concerns it.) But Kirino seems to be jealous of Manami and blame her for taking all of Kyosuke's attention when they were younger. In this episode, she insults Manami in an online conversation with Saori and Kuroneko, who seem to think Kyosuke needs someone less difficult to deal with than Kirino in his life. Kyosuke never seems to figure out why Kirino is jealous of Manami; he may not even know that it is jealousy, thinking she's just being arbitrarily cruel (it doesn't seem out of character for her, although by now I think that it actually is out of character). 

Kirino spends all of Episode 6 mad at Kyosuke for being gone. She kicks his door every time she walks by, and kicks his chair at dinner when she hears from their mother that he's staying with Manami's family. She also tells Saori and Kuroneko that she wanted to show him her new Meruru dakimakura cover, but can't because he's not around. Of course, Manami is blameless for Kirino's jealousy, but with my new psychotic sympathy towards Kirino, I found it adorable that she missed Kyosuke so much that she was mad at him for being gone. If Kyosuke were not quite so dense, he might figure out why Kirino acts like she does towards Manami and they could have a talk about it. 

(It probably doesn't help that Kyosuke seems to think of Manami as a sister more than Kirino. At the beginning of the episode, his friend asks what his feelings toward Manami are and Kyosuke says it's as if a kindly old woman who knew him from birth and was like a grandmother to him suddenly became his own age. He probably just couldn't find the right words to express the platonic love he feels towards Manami. He also, in a very brotherly way, says that if anyone else ever confessed his love to Manami, Kyosuke would sock him. That sort of thing likely just increases Kirino's feeling that Kyosuke wants Manami as a sister instead of her.)

Episode 7 was one of my favorites the first time I saw it. I still liked it, but I guess since I was thoroughly paying attention the first time I watched it, I didn't notice so many little things I'd missed like I did with the first five episodes. It begins with Kyosuke coming home and finding Kuroneko sitting in the dark. Like a total otaku, she gives a line when he turns on the light—something like "I should congratulate you for getting this far." The upshot is that Saori recommended she and Kirino get together to watch Meruru and Maschera, giving them a chance to point out what they like about them, but they got in a fight and Kirino's in her room. They fought because Kirino wrote a terrible novel and Kuroneko, as an aspiring author, was offended by its use of text speak, author avatar heroine, and also the fact that a character modeled after her was raped and murdered.

Kyosuke goes up to Kirino's room and is about to lecture her, but it turns out Kirino was mad because Kuroneko wrote a brick-like Maschera fan book using circuitous syntax, torturous vocabulary, and requiring for understanding a 200-page guide to the special jargon she uses that wasn't in the original series. Also, a character clearly modeled after Kirino was turned into a sex slave by the main character. Since Kuroneko's novel was massive, it seems probable that Kirino actually wrote her own novel for revenge after reading Kuroneko's. 

These two parallel scenes are dripping with adorableness. Kirino and Kuroneko do pretty good impressions of each other (Kuroneko even grows a fang when doing an impression of Kirino), and I liked seeing Kyosuke first apologizing to Kuroneko for his sister's rudeness, and then defending Kirino, saying "Nobody makes my sister a sex slave!" Kuroneko also expounds on her philosophy of writing novels, and as a failed novelist, I can't say I completely agree, but it seems pretty close to what I felt back then. Afterwards, Kyosuke makes them sit down to watch Meruru. Saori calls and gets on speakerphone, watching along at her house. I like seeing Kirino act like a total otaku, and she delivers here, singing along with the opening theme of Meruru and even doing the hand gestures (I do that with K-On sometimes). For otaku, seeing Kirino act like that makes her more relatable, and those scenes are also the scenes when she seems most happy in the series. 

Afterward, the whole thing kind of goes off the rails for the next episode and a half. Kirino posts a novel she wrote to the web and gets a publishing deal, so she decides to write a novel about a post-apocalyptic situation where a girl must collect five little sisters from the various otaku capitals of Tokyo and live with them in the new world. As punishment for saving porn on her laptop, she makes Kyosuke come along and reenact the first few scenes, playing the part of the heroine's boyfriend. She wants Kyosuke to get run over, since apparently the boyfriend gets plowed over and the heroine steals his little sister, Shiori-chan (named for the little sister from Kirino's game Imouto de Koi Shiyou!, which Kyosuke found when he discovered she was an otaku). She also makes him buy her earrings. When Kyosuke gets angry, she pours a bucket of water over her head to simulate the scene where the heroine and Shiori-chan meet, where Shiori-chan is huddled in the pouring rain. They go to a love hotel so Kirino can take a shower and dry off, where Manami calls Kyosuke just in time to hear Kirino say "love hotel" and wonder what the hell's going on. Kyosuke remonstrates Kirino for walking around naked (she's actually in a robe), and she gets disgusted and decides not to reenact the scene where the heroine and Shiori-chan sleep together in the love hotel.

(By the way, in this scene Kirino mentions being puzzled that the shower has so many strange protrusions on the walls. It wasn't until this viewing that I realized they must be handholds so people can have sex in the shower. When I realized this, I found Kirino's innocent bemusement about them very cute.)

OreImo always seemed a little conflicted about whether it was a realistic depiction of otaku life, like Genshiken, or a hyper-realistic portrayal, like Lucky Star or Ichiroh (where all otaku are cute girls and they are everywhere). The early episodes leaned towards the realistic Genshiken side, but the second half of Episode 7 and Episode 8 lean towards the hyper-realistic side. Today I view the dreaded Episode 8, and my opinion on it has always been pretty consistent: it goes much too far towards hyper-realism, with disappointing results. I didn't mind the second half of Episode 7, but it did clash pretty badly with the tone of the first few episodes. I'm a little concerned that the OVA episodes might go for the hyper-realism side (judging by the few plot events I know about, like Kuroneko transferring to Kyosuke's school and joining the otaku club under the presidency of the yaoi-obsessed sister of Kyosuke's friend). OreImo is never at its best when it's on the hyper-realism side; it's always best when it's realistically depicting the growing relationship between Kyosuke and Kirino or the various travails Kirino faces as an otaku in a place where otaku are even more looked down upon than here in the US. 

(It's a little hyper-realistic how quickly Kyosuke adjusts to things that even some otaku can't get used to, like sister-love erogames, when he claims he didn't even know they existed until Kirino showed him. Or there could be a more complicated explanation: he was lying, and was already sort of an otaku before he ever found out Kirino was.)

** On Episodes 8, 9, and 10, written Friday December 2nd, 2011:

I still didn't like Episode 8, but I also didn't dislike it as much as I did last time.

For one thing, my crazed new affection for Kirino made me go "Aww, how sad" when the evil anime writer shot down all of her ideas. I also found Kuroneko's verbal brutality towards Kyosuke and the evil writer during the meeting more amusing than I did before. Most of all, in this episode Kyosuke actually admits (at least to himself) to being jealous of Kirino, wondering why it's always her who has everything go well.

I did think it was overly dramatic when Kirino started stumbling around like she's bleeding to death after the meeting where all of her ideas get shot down. I still didn't like the hyper-realism of Kyosuke's bowing and scraping and Kuroneko's speech actually making the evil anime writer change his mind after seeing their passion. I also feel like it wasn't a very accurate picture of how adaptations actually seem to go nowadays. The lunatics are running the madhouse, and it seems like every animation studio is staffed with a full complement of otaku who delight in trivia, self-reference, and thick, viscous gobs of story. For that reason, I don't find it probable that a group of anime writers who are probably huge otaku themselves would take the work of a writer who's obviously also a massive otaku and then try to do horrible things like change the gender of the main character. (Plus, shows that subsist on nothing but art quality and yuri undertones are everywhere nowadays—K-On being a perfect example, Aria being an arguable example. I'd say Aria subsists on nothing but art quality, yuri undertones, and spiritual nourishment. But the yuri undertones are a whole third of that!)

Anyway, that was Episode 8. Episode 9 is probably my favorite episode of the whole series because this is where Kirino has her turning point, although we don't see the effects at all until Episode 11. Kirino receives her copy of the game Sis x Sis and spends an entire day playing it. The game features two heroines, the friendly Miyabi and the tsundere Rinko. At first Kirino is enjoying everything, giggling madly, babbling at the screen like she's lost her mind, and intermittently masturbating. You know, normal otaku behaviour. (I didn't notice this before, but she stops at Miyabi saying "Oniichan daisuki", puts on wireless headphones, and lays on the bed, replaying that voice clip over and over while giggling and blushing. Then the scene changes and she's laying there on the bed breathing hard and saying how tired she is. Now, what was she doing on the bed listening to "Oniichan daisuki" over and over again that would make her tired?) But soon, she gets annoyed at Rinko's constant insults and complaints, talking back to the game and getting angry. Eventually, though, Kirino gets through Rinko's route to the sex scene and goes to take a shower before watching it. On the way down, she runs into Kyosuke. In Episode 8 and onward, Kirino starts being extra mean to Kyosuke, beating him up for no reason and going out of her way to insult him. She actually wasn't like that in the earlier episodes: yes, they fought constantly, but it was usually when Kyosuke did something to make her mad, not when he was being fairly friendly. I interpret that as a mixture of embarrassment, because she doesn't know how to respond when Kyosuke acts friendly towards her, and greater security in their relationship, knowing that at this point they've reached a certain level that they won't fall below. Either way, though, even with my newfound sympathy towards Kirino, I thought she went too far in this episode and Episode 10.

Anyway, she beats up Kyosuke for pointing at the panties she dropped on the floor and takes a shower, then goes back and watches the sex scene, raving like a madwoman as it progresses. Kyosuke, on the other side of the wall, can hear every word and comments that having to listen to his little sister's "ero na koe" through the wall is the worst. He pounds on the wall and yells at her, telling her to keep it down because he can hear everything; Kirino calls him a pervert and accuses him of recording it, to which Kyosuke replies that she's the real pervert for even thinking of that. Anyway, as usual, they fight. Later, they run into each other as Kyosuke comes out of the bath and Kyosuke tries to act friendly, but Kirino kicks the crap out of him and tells him to go die. There is no "flash of recognition", but I think this is the moment Kirino realizes she's acting like Rinko in the early part of the game and reflects on how unpleasant that was for her, because when Kyosuke says she's always like that, Kirino just says "Don't try to act like you understand me", and settles for sticking out her tongue at him when he says good night, clearly embarrassed. I think Kirino went overboard by kicking the crap out of Kyosuke, but he probably could've handled the problem with her loud enjoyment of the sex scene in some other way too, such as moving into the kitchen to study for a while. 

This episode also included some adorable scenes of Kuroneko at home with her sister, making lunch for her, putting on Meruru for her, and later going to her room and writing blog posts and acting like a total otaku. I mentioned in my original thoughts how much I loved these scenes because they completed Kuroneko's transformation from her original image as an annoying privileged suburban teenager to a lower-middle class girl who lives in a small, somewhat dingy apartment, loves and takes good care of her younger sister, and probably has a hard time making friends because of her weirdness. The scene where Kuroneko is making a stuffed animal while talking to Kyosuke on the phone, trying to recover from her surprise at his call and summon her usual "dark magic" persona, all while her younger sister takes a nap on her lap, was too cute.

I didn't remember enjoying Episode 10 as much as I did this time, but it seemed really fun. It starts with Ayase calling Kyosuke to the park and asking him to help her pick a birthday present for Kirino related to her otaku hobbies. Ayase reveals that she's been talking about anime a little with Kirino (anything that doesn't seem "indecent") and trying to accept the hobby a little more. Episode 8 also included a cute scene at the beginning where Kirino tells Ayase about her novel being published and apologizes because they might not be able to hang out that much while she's busy with writing. She asks Ayase to keep the novel a secret and they pinky swear; when Kanako comes up and finds them with their pinkies linked, she asks if they're lesbians (which they are in several doujinshi). Then Kanako says something about writing a novel that would be a big success by just throwing together a bunch of random sex scenes, and Ayase, showing what a good friend she is to Kirino, says she doubts it's that easy to write a novel.

Ayase continues showing what a good friend she is to Kirino by trying to learn a little about Kirino's hobby, but when Ayase doesn't appreciate Kirino's vast collection of Meruru figures, Kirino gets mad and refuses to talk to her for a while. Ayase tells Kyosuke she wants to get something nice for Kirino to make up for it, and Kyosuke says he'll find out what would be good. He tries asking Kirino directly, but she gets mad and says the idea of him getting her a present is creepy and disgusting. She also gets angry because he's been hanging out with Ayase, Kuroneko, and Saori when she's not around (the weird giant mecha-themed cafe where he met Kuroneko and Saori in Episode 8 has a cockpit-themed women's restroom; when Kirino wonders what the men's is, Kuroneko says reflexively that it's a command room and then has to explain that she knows because Kyosuke told her.) Kyosuke meets up with them again at the weird giant mecha-themed cafe and asks for their help finding a present; after a fruitless day of searching, they discover a Meruru cosplay contest with a limited-edition figure as a prize.

Kyosuke suggests that Ayase dress up as the Dark Witch Thanatos EX (or something like that), a Meruru character who wears pants with no ass in them. Ayase freaks out and punches him (not like Kirino's slapping—closed fist), but Kyosuke reminds her that there's no other way to win the figure—they need someone who can beat the reigning champion, Bridget-chan. Ayase looks at the front of the Meruru DVD that Kyosuke brought so she could verify that it wasn't an indecent show and says "I just have to beat that girl in looks and accuracy, right?", looking all cool and determined while hatching an evil plot.

Ayase tricks Kanako by telling her there's a gig, getting her dressed up as Meruru, and having the driver of the van she changes in run off before Kanako knows it's a cosplay contest. Kanako goes up and sings the theme song of Meruru, narrowly defeating Bridget-chan. Kirino, who is in the audience, gets a nosebleed while watching and somehow doesn't recognize her at all. (Don't tell me Kirino doesn't at least have lesbian tendencies.) Afterwards, Kanako, who is a complete bitch, throws away the prize and makes Bridget-chan cry; Kyosuke recovers the figure and gives it to Ayase and they both leave, happy their plan worked, leaving Kanako in the backroom. Later, Kirino is grinning at the figure on her desk as she reads a news story showing that Kanako got into a tussle with the police, still dressed in her Meruru costume, after she was abandoned with no regular clothes.

I don't know why I didn't appreciate this episode before. For one thing, it's an Ayase episode, and every time I watch the show I'm shocked by how much I like watching Ayase. She's just endlessly interesting, much more than a judgmental prig who looks down on otaku or a mindless sheep who believes everything on the news. For one thing, she's a junior high school girl who watches the news. How many of those do you know? And she keeps showing what a good friend she actually is to Kirino; once the initial incident is over, Ayase keeps Kirino's secret and even tries to learn a little about anime so they can become closer. Also, there's her deviousness. This episode wouldn't be nearly as fun if Ayase had just overcome her distaste and done the Dark Witch cosplay herself (for one thing, the Dark Witch doesn't even look that much like her). Instead, I liked watching how she completely tricks Kanako, who finally gets what she deserves when she's dragged off by the police, and without a second thought takes advantage of Kanako's trust in her and the fact that Kanako is a fame whore who'll do anything to get on a stage. Then there's her yandere side. It seems I'm not the only one who saw the devious yandere side, because there's a doujinshi where she executes a devious yandere plot to rape Kirino. (I don't think she wants to rape Kirino in the actual series, but she's definitely got some yandere in there.) The yandere doesn't show up in this episode, but I really enjoyed how it suddenly appeared in Episode 5, with the seemingly nice, beautiful girl who might have a bit of a crush on Kyosuke suddenly becoming crazy, her pupils dilating, her fingers digging viciously into Kirino's wrist as she more and more intensely reminds Kirino how much she hates being lied to. I mentioned in my original thoughts how Kuroneko and Ayase were the two characters I enjoyed watching the most; at this point I wouldn't hesitate to say that Kuroneko is my favorite character and Ayase is my second-favorite (with Kirino in third). Kyosuke probably would've completely avoided becoming close with his sister if he'd known it would end in him meeting Hannibal Lector's teenage daughter.

[By the way, of course there are doujinshi about a menage à trois between Kirino, Kyosuke, and Kuroneko. Nice job, doujinshi authors! I'd also like to congratulate them for the menages à trois between Kirino, Kyosuke, and Ayase and the yuri doujins about Kirino and Ayase. But I'm still waiting for a Kirino/Kuroneko doujin where Kyosuke is not involved.]

** On Episode 11, Saturday, December 3rd, 2011:

The first time I watched the series (that magical phrase that begins every comment I make on this reviewing), Episode 11 was sort of a release valve in which all the tension, bad feelings, and anger between Kyosuke and Kirino was vented into the atmosphere and Kirino finally began to value Kyosuke and stop being mean to him. It was still an enormously cute episode, but it felt pretty different this time.

For one thing, the way Kirino treats Manami seemed much less horrible this time. The writers were on Manami's side and let her earnestness and housework skills overcome Kirino's evil traps, so nothing really bad actually happens. But mostly, it no longer seemed like Kirino was just arbitrarily trying to cut Manami down when Manami had done nothing but try to be friendly. Kirino's behaviour was actually due to the accretion of years of jealousy and feelings of inferiority; all this time she was thinking that Manami stole her brother from her. Manami couldn't possibly know that and didn't have any fault for it, but Kirino doesn't seem to be very good at hiding anger and hatred, and expresses many other emotions as anger, including embarrassment. (Recall that she even refused to talk to Ayase for a little while after Ayase asked why she had so many Meruru figurines; otherwise, Ayase seems to be the only member of the main cast who doesn't get the full blast of Kirino's anger. I don't know how two extreme personalities like Kirino and Kanako hang out together without killing each other.) Kirino couldn't possibly avoid acting on such a long-running, deep-seated resentment somehow, especially when Manami is in Kirino's own house and thus in a vulnerable position. After failing to cut Manami down directly, Kirino tries to make Kyosuke look bad in front of her by spreading his porn on his bed and leaving her computer on his desk with an erogame sex scene on the screen. Manami resists this as well, simply asking Kyosuke if she wants her to call him "oniichan" (Kirino probably would've literally cut her down if she did. Or she would get Ayase to lure Manami into a dungeon of pain and slowly torture her to death with an awl.)

After this, Saori invites Kyosuke to a party celebrating the anime adaptation of Kirino's novel. She and Kirino appear in maid outfits and, as I mentioned above, Kyosuke is underwhelmed, saying "It's just you and my sister", then asks where Kuroneko is. Kuroneko is hiding behind the curtains, like a real kuro neko. When she comes out wearing a maid outfit along with nekomimi and a tail, Kyosuke's reaction is positive but highly muted compared with that of Kirino, who says Kuroneko is "so cute". In the subtitles, Kirino goes on to say the costume is "bad news"; in Japanese she starts going "yabai", which is translated just fine by "bad news" when she says the costume is "yabai" (my dictionary translates the word as slang for "dangerous"), but it's also her favorite word when she's watching a sex scene in an erogame. Most of Kirino's "ero na koe" from Episode 9 consists of the word "yabai" and a listing of all the things which are "yabai", such as "Rinko-rin no ero kawaisa". Basically, she was getting turned on by Kuroneko's costume. (Though she didn't get a nosebleed like she did from Kanako's costume in Episode 10. Maybe if Kuroneko sang.) Those two need to hook up already, at least in doujin form.

Kuroneko presents her manga, which features a pair of characters who look exactly like Kyosuke and Kirino, are brother and sister just like Kyosuke and Kirino, and live in a house that looks exactly like Kyosuke and Kirino's house, but according to Kuroneko are not Kyosuke and Kirino. This assertion actually gains some traction in the first scene, where the Kirino character is sniffing the Kyosuke character's boxers, saying "Aah...Oniichan no pantsu..."; Kyosuke and Kirino both revolt at that scene, and Kirino seizes the computer that Kuroneko is projecting the pages from. Kuroneko protests that they were just about to embark on a holy war for the future of mankind (I guess she couldn't escape the bounds of her genre after all). 

Anyway, the episode ends as I mentioned above, with Kirino grudgingly giving Kyosuke the present and finally thanking him for everything he's done for her. Kyosuke's monologue here indicates that he was actually trying to trick himself with what he said in Episode 8 about not needing any thanks from Kirino and doing everything for her just because she's his sister. He seems to admit to himself that he likes hearing her gratitude and feels closer to her now because he knows she was grateful for everything he did. These undertones, which I missed on my first viewing, are a lot more interesting than the idea that Kyosuke did everything for Kirino out of family obligation, which is not only boring but inconsistent with his behaviour at the start of the series and the jealousy he admitted to himself in Episode 8. Kyosuke actually cries while delivering this monologue, which I found very touching and sweet; Kirino says it's creepy, but she says it in a nice way. Then Kyosuke opens the present and sees that it's an erogame (the same game, Sis x Sis, that Kirino was playing in Episode 9) and bursts into laughter. Kuroneko asks Saori if he's broken, and Saori replies that that's the correct response; they both seem taken aback that Kirino's gift was an erogame. 

After watching Episode 12, I plan to take a short break from OreImo to watch other things before coming back to watch the OVA episodes, so Episode 12 will be the last one for now. I did a pretty thorough review of it in my original thoughts, but I don't know what kinds of new things will leap out at me. After the review of Episode 12 I'll write a ranking of the characters in the series (probably leaving out people like Bridget-chan and Kirino and Kyosuke's parents) and a ranking of the ending songs. I'll probably do another ranking of ending songs after watching the OVA episodes, since one of my favorite endings, "Ready", seems to be an OVA ending.

** Thoughts on Review of Episode 12, "Ore no Imouto no Jinsei Soudan ga Kore de Owaru Wake ga Nai (Good End)" written Sunday, December 4th, 2011:

The rushed feeling I got from this episode the first time I watched it seemed nonexistent this time. It actually felt like a very nice, if somewhat incomplete, conclusion to the series. 

As I wrote before, the episode begins with Kirino transformed. Kyosuke says to Manami that's not Kirino, it's something wearing her face, before running into Ayase, who he asks about anything that might account for Kirino's behavior. Ayase probably assumes he already knows about the trip and says there isn't anything. 

But hints abound that Kirino is actually trying very hard to tell Kyosuke honestly about the trip and is finding it just as difficult as she found it to thank him in Episode 11. In my original thoughts, I said that I believed Kirino had set up the whole situation with the erogame to try and get Kyosuke to tell her he didn't want her to go, but I think now that she actually was going to ask him if she should go as her "final life counseling" and when she found she couldn't, came up with the idea to make him buy the erogame instead to buy herself time. Anyway, she asks him to buy Oniichan no Pantsu nanka Zettai Nusunde Nai n Dakara ne, thoughtfully abbreviated to OniPan, unlike the second-rate Eiichiro Oda ecchi series with a very similar title, and another game.

While Kyosuke is out buying the games, Kirino receives a call from Kuroneko, who wants to know her head size so she can make Kirino a pair of cat ears like the ones Kirino admired so much in Episode 11, and yes, I remembered incorrectly in my original thoughts: Kuroneko did not say in Episode 11 that Kirino would soon find out why she was calling Kyosuke "Oniisan"; instead, she said in this episode that she would soon be calling him something else ("sempai", it seems). I'm curious to find out when I start the OVA episodes whether Kuroneko just happened to be transferring into Kyosuke's school by chance or whether she chose it because he was there. Later in this episode, Kirino refers to the first episode taking place nine months ago, so Kuroneko could've easily decided her transfer plans on that basis.

Kyosuke returns with the games and is about to go to bed, but Kirino, seemingly in another bid to buy herself the time to say what she wants, asks him to stay up and play the game with her. When the game ends with the underwear-stealing little sister and Oniichan separated, Kirino cries, and when Kyosuke comments that they're not dead or anything and she can just call him, Kirino asks him to think about how sad it is when you can't see the person you want to, seemingly talking about herself. Kyosuke is about to go to bed again and Kirino finally decides to show him the plane ticket, but chokes in the middle and doesn't want to. As usual, Kyosuke responds in the most dense and crude way he could, trying to grab the album and making the ticket fall out, along with the picture that shows us Kirino's original hair color. (People in the series are always commenting that Kyosuke and Kirino don't look alike, which briefly led to speculation on the ANN forums that they would turn out not to be related by blood, but their eyes are actually a similar color and they looked much more alike when Kirino had her natural hair color.)

Kirino tells him about the trip and when he asks why she didn't let him know before, she says it's because it's nothing to do with him, and he should be glad since he's always acting like she's bothering him, and then throws in at the end that he bothers her too. They start fighting, during which the computer playing the erogame is knocked off the table and responds to Kyosuke's question "What do you want me to tell you?" with "Tell me not to go, Oniichan". After this plays, Kirino stays silent as if it said exactly what she wanted to (which it probably did, although she never could've uttered it). Kyosuke tells her to just go, clearly angry. Throughout this scene, the two fight brutally, but Kirino is thoroughly enraged and gives about five times as much as she gets. When Kyosuke tells her to go, she headbutts him in the jaw, knocking him unconscious (which probably should've broken his jaw if it was enough to knock him unconscious). He wakes up the next morning in his bed and finds his bruises bandaged and a pile of bloody tissues in the wastebasket; this must have been done by Kirino, because when he sneaks downstairs, his parents think he's just coming back from being out all night. Interestingly, his father isn't bothered by this; either he trusts that Kyosuke wasn't doing anything bad, or he just doesn't care because he only likes Kirino.

Kirino comes into the kitchen and announces that she's not going, and Kyosuke spends the last few minutes of the episode grinning from ear to ear and refusing to tell anyone why he's so happy. Then we get a montage of various characters as they continue living their lives, the most notable being Kuroneko practicing her peppy cat girl meowing and pawing in front of the mirror in her cat-eared maid outfit. The final scene reproduces an early scene from the first episode, with Kyosuke coming home and finding Kirino on the couch; this time, instead of ignoring him, Kirino says she needs life counseling and Kyosuke readily agrees. It seems that in this ending, their relationship has improved and even though they were never honest with each other about their feelings, they are able to get along well.

** Thoughts on Episode 13, "Ore no Imouto no Jinsei Soudan ga Kore de Owaru Wake ga Nai (True End)" and Episode 14, begun Tuesday, December 6th, 2011:

I am a total pushover. I couldn't stand waiting, so I just started watching the OVA episodes despite what I wrote before. So far, though, I've been rewarded for going back on my word.

First of all, Episode 13 has possibly my favorite ending song from the whole series, "Ready". I suspected this might be the case since the lyrics talk about saying goodbye without saying good morning and other things that seem applicable to the supposed events of this episode. The beginning goes exactly like Episode 12, up to the point where Kyosuke buys the games for Kirino at the midnight sale. Kyosuke misses the last train, so he asks a nerd who rode an OniPan bicycle if he can borrow it. The nerd agrees, saying he doesn't believe anyone who likes little sister eroge could be a bad person, and Kyosuke rides home and gets the games to Kirino. They play together as before and Kirino asks if Kyosuke will look at the album, but Kyosuke decides he's too tired and says he doesn't want to. Kirino, relieved, puts it away and shows him her box of report cards, where she got bad grades in PE (somehow; I guess they grade you on that stuff in Japan), and track medals, which I guess she keeps together as a "Screw you" to her old PE teachers. Anyway, the picture from Episode 12 where a young Kirino with her natural hair color is crying while holding a relay baton was probably a picture of some event from her childhood that made her decide to work hard on the track team. She tells Kyosuke those bad grades in PE made her angry and that's why she works so hard at track, and they go to bed, with Kyosuke feeling good about everything. The next morning he wakes up and Kirino is gone. Their father explains that she went on the trip, which he refused to pay for since he didn't want her to go. 

We don't see Kyosuke's feelings about this right away. In fact, Manami comments on the first day of the new school year that he seems happier and nicer than before. On the way, he spots Kuroneko in their school uniform and stops to ask her what's going on, and the episode ends. Then they play possibly my favorite ending from the entire series. (I love the song "Ready", but it's also hard to beat the emotional context that the Episode 12 ending, "Tadaima", capitalizes on, and the illustration with "Tadaima" is possibly my favorite illustration in the series.)

In Episode 14, we pick up there and Kuroneko explains that she goes to his school now, but coming to the school had nothing to do with him. She leaves, and Manami asks who she was. Kyosuke says she's a mutual friend of his and Kirino's, and when Manami asks her name, responds "Kuroneko" before realizing he has no idea what her real name is.

Anyway, I was afraid that the OVA episodes would be full of hyper-realism, but Episode 14 was actually just a little more hyper-realistic than the rest of the episodes (less so than some, like Episode 8 or Episode 10). Actually, the series seems to be taking this opportunity to give Kuroneko some nice, meaty character-building moments, and Saori also had some good scenes. As I predicted when I reviewed Episode 9, it turns out that Kuroneko (whose real name is Ruri Gokou) has trouble making friends because of her oddness. She's also the proud type (as we've seen), so she won't admit that she wants friends and claims to have no use for them. Kyosuke is worried about her and decides to try and get her involved in a club, getting her to join the video game research club. When he sees her on cleaning duty by herself, he and Manami decide to help, but Kuroneko gets angry and says he's just trying to meddle in her life because Kirino, whose life he used to meddle in, is gone now and he's bored. 

Actually, Kuroneko was spending a lot of time hanging out at Kyosuke's house with Kyosuke and Saori. In an early scene, the three of them discuss their feelings about Kirino leaving. Kyosuke claims that he's glad to have the headache gone; Kuroneko claims she was growing tired of "that woman"; only Saori is willing to be honest and say that she felt a little angry that Kirino left without saying anything to her or Kuroneko. Kyosuke decides at the end that they should all go do something fun and write about it on the Internet to make Kirino jealous. Later, after Kuroneko berates Kyosuke for trying to make her a replacement for Kirino, Kyosuke talks to Saori about it. Saori tells him that Kuroneko seems to have a lot to do at home (we know she has to take care of her little sister a lot, and also seems to cook and clean for her parents) and probably wasn't joining a club or making any friends because she didn't want to do anything to reduce the amount of time she had to spend with Kyosuke and Saori. Saori shone in both of these scenes: in the first one, I liked seeing her be the only one mature enough to admit that she both missed Kirino and was mad at her, instead of pretending not to care like the other two; in the second scene, I liked seeing how well she knows Kuroneko and how good she was at providing Kyosuke with the information to have a little finesse. If Kyosuke had consulted Saori about Kirino, some parts of the series might've been less painful for him.

Kyosuke also continues his move to being a pseudo-otaku. He becomes a pseudo member of the Game Research Club when Kuroneko joins, and early on in the episode, when he and Manami try to invite her to do something, she claims she has to go because Maschera is on; Kyosuke, however, knows that Maschera ended with Season 2, Episode 12 and is no longer on. 

Speaking of the Game Research Club, it's the guilty party for most of the hyper-realism in this episode. First of all, the nerd who lent Kyosuke the OniPan bicycle in Episode 13 turns out to be the president of the club; he's been held back several times and is in his twenties. Genshiken had something vaguely similar, but it didn't already have so many hyper-realistic elements working against it, so it was easier to take—and the Genshiken president was said to be working on his master's thesis. Also, the club's only other female member is Sena Akagi, the little sister of Kyosuke's classmate Kouhei Akagi, for whom Kouhei bought a game about macho gay men in Episode 12 and Episode 13. She seems to be a self-hating otaku, the type who says that otaku aren't discriminated against except when they do things like randomly strike poses, spout catchphrases, or play erogames in public (tell that to Kirino, after everything she went through). Kyosuke suspects Sena is his classmate's sister and tricks her into revealing her love for homos, during which she says she had a dream last night where the smallest member of the Game Research Club was gang-raped by the other members. Obviously, he does not respond well to this; Sena freaks out and starts rolling around on the table verbally flagellating herself for doing this again. Kyosuke calls her brother and asks what to do to calm her down, and Akagi says he has to say things like "Sena-chan, you're so cute" and "Sena-chan, it's not your fault" until she is pacified. Kyosuke isn't willing to do this, so he puts Akagi on the phone with her. (It turns out that Sena calls her brother "Onii-chan"; I assume no two pairs of siblings could have the same weird relationship that Kyosuke and Kirino do, so Akagi probably buys her erogames out of genuine affection and in return she calls him "Onii-chan".)

I found Sena amusing, but her meltdown in semi-public was notably more hyper-realistic than anything the other characters did. Maybe it won't end up bothering me, but I hope we don't come out with a cast of crazy characters like some terrible Love Hina clone. Maybe she was sort of a bonus for readers of the novel and the next episode will focus mostly on Kuroneko. I'm hoping Kirino returns for the final episode, at least temporarily; I'm also hoping that Ore Imo 2 is a possibility, even if it does go off the rails, since even when it gets hyper-realistic, Ore Imo is still better than most shows.

The episode ends with Kyosuke admitting to Kuroneko that he misses Kirino and telling her he's going to keep meddling in her life whether she likes it or not, even if he's just doing it because Kirino's not around. Kuroneko tells him to do whatever he wants. 

Episode 14 felt really long; a lot happened, and it didn't have a very linear plot, but I really liked the Saori scenes (because it's the first time she really did anything) and the scenes between Kuroneko and Kyosuke. Those two have had something going from the beginning; maybe it's because they both go through a lot to take care of their younger sisters, making them feel close to one another. I also couldn't help liking Sena, even if she is hyper-realistic (hyper-realistic personalities are closer to normal for Ore Imo than hyper-realistic events, since Kirino herself is pretty hyper-realistic. Or I guess she's not hyper-realistic if you assume she's a lesbian, which doesn't seem totally unjustified. But things like the twenty-four-year-old high school student president are going a little too far for my taste). I missed Kirino, but the episode gave me a lot in return.

[I think watching Yosuga no Sora and sympathizing with Sora eroded my brain and made me sympathize with Kirino. After all, compared with Sora, Kirino's a shrinking violet.]

** Thoughts on Episode 15 from Wednesday, December 7th, 2011 (A day which will live in infamy):

I forgot to mention this before, but the opening sequence has changed since Kirino left. The animation changed every episode up to Episode 12, with different characters floating around in the background; for the OVA episodes they've stuck with the animation from Episode 12, but at the very end, where before Kirino ran up and walked alongside Kyosuke by the tracks, it's just Kyosuke by himself; also, when the singer says "Egao misetai" and it used to show Kirino sitting in front of her computer and smiling beautifully, we now see her dark, empty room (Kuroneko was sitting at her computer for this episode).

Anyway, Episode 15, "Ore no Kouhai ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai", had a much more linear plot than Episode 14 (by the way, ever since Kirino has been gone, the episode titles have substituted "kouhai" for "imouto", but it's never clear whether they're talking about Kuroneko or Sena; here it seems pretty obvious that it's Kuroneko, but in Episode 14 it doesn't make sense because Kuroneko's not a fujoshi. Just idle complaining.)

The episode starts with Kyosuke and Sena meeting at the bookstore. Kyosuke is trying to find out something about game making, but the books on C and C++ in the clubroom are over his head, so he asks Sena to help him. The two converse about Sena, and Sena claims that she hates her brother Kouhei, but Kyosuke brings up the way she spoke to him on the phone after her meltdown, which definitely didn't seem like hatred. Watching her get annoyed somehow convinces Kyosuke she's a good person.

Next, the Game Research Club president arbitrarily decides that he's going to force Kuroneko and Sena to make a game together and they'll enter it in some contest. The idea is to make them get along, since they fight horribly for some reason. (It doesn't seem to be over anime preference like when Kuroneko and Kirino fight.) They're both working on games by themselves already, so the president tells them to each make a pitch and the other members will pick one. He also makes Kyosuke their project manager (apparently Kyosuke is a member of the club now). Sena wants to make a dungeon-crawling RPG, while Kuroneko wants to do a novel game with a massive story that she's already worked out to exacting detail. When the other members criticize the dark tone and dense plot of the story, Kuroneko makes a speech about how a certain friend that she hates annoyed her into writing it by saying that her work is nothing but self-indulgent masturbation fodder that's no fun and she should just try to have fun while writing what she loves. Since Kuroneko loves self-indulgent masturbation fodder, she decided to write this. (Although she probably doesn't get a lot of masturbation done since her sisters are always peeking into her room wondering what the hell she's doing.) Here and elsewhere in the episode, I enjoyed seeing how Kuroneko has been affected for the better by knowing Kirino; she's become more tolerant, less proud, and also more driven to do the best writing she can by Kirino's success with the novel. You could even say the climax is a demonstration of how important knowing Kirino has been for her. 

The other members end up voting for Kuroneko's project; the president admits that they probably would've chosen Sena's, except they found the secret gay orgy drawings of the characters, modeled after the members of the club, that she included. Sena gets mad and says she's going to tell her oniichan on them, then stops coming to the club, leaving Kuroneko to work on the game alone. 

Kyosuke agrees to test the game for her, and they spend lots of time working together in Kyosuke's room. During one work session, Kuroneko asks Kyosuke to come lay on his bed with her to read something she's written, but Kyosuke feels strange until Kuroneko asks him why it's okay to play erogames with his sister, but not to briefly lay down next to her. (Kirino told her about that.) He goes for it and tries to taunt Kuroneko, asking if she likes him, but she defeats him by saying she does like him—as much as Kirino likes him. Kyosuke thinks to himself that this means she doesn't like him at all—I have to wonder if he's really that dense or if he just feels embarrassed to think that Kirino actually likes him at all. (Maybe he took her running off without telling him as a sign of dislike.) Kuroneko starts calling him Nii-san again and asks whether he prefers "senpai" or "nii-san". Kyosuke says he prefers "senpai" because she's not his sister, so it's weird for her to call him "nii-san", and Kuroneko declares that she'll call him "nii-san" only in private.

The two finish the game, but Kuroneko seems to be more about writing and drawing than programming, and the game is full of infinite loops and other bugs. It would take the members of the club too long to debug it, and the contest deadline would have passed. Kuroneko runs off and Kyosuke follows her, but stays in hiding when he sees her go into Sena's classroom and ask for Sena's help fixing the game. Sena's yaoi RPG had impressive high-speed programming techniques (I assume that means optimization techniques, because no other meaning makes sense—the only other possibility I came up was parallel processing, and you wouldn't need that for a cheap Wizardry-style game made by one person) that showed her to be a skilled programmer capable of fixing the game. Kuroneko swallows her pride and asks for Sena's help with debugging. Together, Kuroneko, Sena, and Kyosuke finish the game in time, and a small postscript after the ending shows that it won the award for worst game in the contest.

As much as Kyosuke has been trying to help Kuroneko since she came to his school, she probably couldn't have humbled herself enough to ask for Sena's help if not for her experience dealing with Kirino. Both Kirino and Kuroneko probably had to moderate their arrogant, prideful natures a bit when dealing with each other.

Anyway, ahead of watching Episode 16 (the finale), here's my current favorites list of characters and ending songs. The character list is edited a bit, while the ending list should be comprehensive.

Characters

1. Ruri "Kuroneko" Gokou

As I said before, she was my favorite. I loved seeing how her arrogance and pride is a pose and she's actually lower-middle class, domestic-minded, and has a hard time getting along with others. I sympathize with the difficulty that her pride gives her in making friends. Seeing her with her little sister was too cute. I also admired her for being nice to Kyosuke; at the beginning it seemed like everyone was mean to him—except for Ayase, and we saw what happened there—but Kuroneko and Saori were both nice to him from the beginning, proving that otaku can be good people (even if we're weird). Kana Hanazawa's voice is perfect, and she shows a little more range with Kuroneko—still a little quiet and whispery, but confident when fitting.

2. Ayase Aragaki

I think I've said everything there is to say, but let's recap. Ayase first appears and seems like a cheerful, nice girl who wants to think the best of people. After the incident where Kyosuke grabbed the makeup box full of doujinshi, Ayase asked him if the box was a special present for Kirino that he didn't want her to open yet. Then at the beginning of Episode 5, just for a second, Ayase becomes completely psychotic, like she's Shion Sonozaki or Rena Ryugu or something. For some reason, casual overviews of the characters always describe Ayase as "nice, but too easily swayed by the news". Ayase is not nice. She seems nice—she even does several very nice things for Kirino—but she is psychotic. She probably believed that story on the news because to her, kidnapping someone and electrocuting them is a perfectly normal thing to do. Maybe she was mad because she never thought of using electricity. She's also devious, tricking Kanako in Episode 10 into dressing up as Meruru and manipulating Kanako's fame whore personality to win the Meruru figure as a present for Kirino. (Then she leaves Kanako to get dragged in by the police while dressed as Meruru.)

Ayase is just damn fun and a total surprise. The show wouldn't be nearly as fun if she had just disappeared or had become an otaku alongside Kirino; it wouldn't be half as good if she hadn't secretly turned out to be insane. Saori Hayami also does a good job with her voice, using a cute lilt when Ayase is acting normal, and changing to a horrific shriek when Ayase is angry. (When I first heard Haqua's voice in Kami Nomi, I knew I'd heard it before but couldn't place it. It took me half the episode to realize it was Ayase's voice.)

3. Kirino Kousaka

If I'd done this list after my original thoughts, Kirino probably would've been near the bottom. But Yosuga no Sora has eroded my brain. I love Kirino: she's too cute and her otaku side is completely identifiable. Kirino is actually the motive force behind the series: she's the one with fantasies of being close with her brother like in games (well, maybe not that close), and when she sees the opportunity to make it happen, she takes it, asking what Kyosuke would think of her if he knew she was an otaku and deciding to take him into her confidence when he says he wouldn't make fun of her. She was possibly the deepest character in the series, with complicated motives and feelings. Also, I like yuri, and Kirino was the most yuri-ready character in the series, having logical yuri subtext with both Ayase and Kuroneko (it doesn't hurt that her yuri subtext is with my top two favorites, either). She's just too adorable when she gets going on her otaku rambling while playing a game, her expression ecstatic, her fang flashing, going "Yabai! Yabai!!" (Why does she have a fang to begin with? Is she a vampire?) Ayana Taketatsu does a great job with her voice, putting a brash, shrill note into her cute Azu-nyan voice. Even when Azu-nyan was furious, she never sounded like Kirino; Ayana Taketatsu delivers every ounce of Kirino's disgust when she's angry, but also manages to give sad Kirino and happy Kirino a distinct note that made me never realize she was also Azu-nyan until I read the K-On credits.

4. Kyosuke Kousaka

Like Kyon, Yuuichi Aizawa, and Tomoya Okazaki (whose voice he shares), Kyosuke is much more than just a generic loser put there as a placeholder for the viewer. He is a fully integrated and important part of the show. He has his own personality and feelings, and although most of the show is told from his perspective, we sometimes get hints that he's not a totally reliable narrator (similar to Kyon in the Haruhi series). He's jealous of Kirino's success and has been for years, but when he sees a chance to help Kirino, he still takes it, apparently touched by her decision to confide in him. He can be crude and dense and he pathologically meddles in others' lives, but he has good intentions (Kuroneko mentions something about this in Episode 16). I also disagree with the perception among other viewers that Kyosuke is a complete wimp who obeys Kirino's every whim; yes, he does tend to do a lot for her, but he doesn't always do it gladly. Half of all the favors he does for Kirino he does without her even knowing it (yelling at the anime producers in Episode 8, helping Ayase get the figure in Episode 10); when she does start ordering him around, he usually gets angry and starts yelling back, as in Episode 7 when he gets tired of being dragged around and makes sarcastic remarks about Kirino's novel writing techniques. Kirino is the main driving force of the show, but Kyosuke is sort of the "goal" that she's driving for, and together the two of them make the show something more than (at best) another Genshiken and (at worst) another Kujibiki Unbalance.

5. Tie: Saori Vageena / Sena Akagi

This was a hard choice because Saori's been around since the very beginning, but she never really did anything and we don't find out much about her in the series, so I couldn't place her very high. On the other hand, Sena is only around for three episodes, but we find out more about her than we do about Saori in the whole series.

Anyway, Saori is sort of an otaku den mother, keeping Kirino and Kuroneko from killing each other (actually, Kirino would probably destroy Kuroneko in a physical fight) and setting up events for them. I infer some motherly impulse by what she did in Episode 2 and afterwards. Consider: Saori had a whole group of otaku girls show up for the meeting she held. She seemed to get along well with all of them and could've been friends with any of them, yet she went out of her way to pick out Kirino and Kuroneko, the two who couldn't connect with anyone else. Then she does everything in her power to be friends with them and to make them friends with each other, setting up excursions to Akihabara, chatting with them on the Internet, and even suggesting the Meruru/Maschera viewing party in Episode 7. Not only that, but she shows more evidence of a mature attitude in Episode 14 when she's the only one who honestly expresses her feelings about Kirino leaving.

Sena is the opposite of Saori: immature and divisive. But she's also incredibly amusing, with her yaoi obsession and weird relationship with her brother. She claims he just has a sister complex, which seems to be true, but she also seems to enjoy their closeness and hangs on to infantile traits like telling her brother on the club when they shoot down her game proposal and needing to be soothed out of her self-hating mania with praise from him. I also respected that she was good at programming. 

6. Manami Tamura

A little bit boring, but cute and sweet. A few years ago Manami probably would've been my favorite character. The first time I watched the series I liked her more than Kirino, but she does seem a little bit boring this time. Still, I really wanted her to hook up with Kyosuke since she seems to like him so much. I feel sorry for her getting upstaged by Kuroneko in Kyosuke's affections. (I also feel bad because I forgot to add her until I had already added Kyosuke and Kirino's parents.)

7. Daisuke Kousaka

He was a good source of drama in the series and also I'm trying to lower Kanako's score.

8. Manami's brother whose name I forget

He was amusing and also I'm trying to lower Kanako's score.

9. Kuroneko's little sister

Their scenes together were really cute and also I want to lower Kanako's score.

10. Manami's grandparents

Fairly amusing and good enough for lowering Kanako's score.

11. Yoshino Kousaka

For some reason she's always mocking Kyosuke for his porn, which was fairly amusing and also helps lower Kanako's score.

12. Kanako Kurusu

She was horrible, probably the best depiction in all of anime of a real middle school girl--the sort of "riaru na onna" that Keima Katsuragi is always complaining about. Kanako may look cute, but she's actually a gold digger, fame whore, and all-around terrible person. Ayase probably knows this and therefore didn't feel bad at all about manipulating her to win the Meruru figure. In fact, Ayase might have predicted she would do something stupid if left alone with no regular clothes and purposely left her to her fate. In any case, she deserved every bit of it. Kanako actually goes below people like Fate-san (Kirino's editor) and Manami's parents, I'm just too lazy to include them.

Endings

The ranking for an ending depends mostly on the song, but the art also comes into consideration for close ranks. There will be no ties! This list should not be construed to suggest that I dislike any of the endings. For a show to have 16 endings and have all of them be better than the endings of some shows with only one ending is quite impressive. 

1. "Ready", Episode 13, "Ore no Imouto no Jinsei Soudan ga Kore de Owaru Wake ga Nai (True Route)", sung by Ayana Taketatsu

An adorable song that's fun to listen to and which, I felt, best captures the emotions Kirino feels during the episode and throughout the series. The art was also very nice, with amazing use of lighting. Kirino looks a little more mature here, and I liked seeing her in her track outfit with her hair up. (Keima Katsuragi would approve.)

2. "Suki nan da mon" (Because I love her), Episode 9, sung by Ayana Taketatsu

Also extremely cute and a lot of fun. I like how the lyrics talk about Kirino's love for anime and erogames and little sisters. It all sounds oddly familiar. The art is cute and sexy, with Kirino in nekomimi and buruma.

3. "Iie, Tom wa Imouto ni Taishite Seiteki na Kimochi wo Oboeteimasu" (No, Tom is experiencing sexual feelings towards his sister), Episode 10, sung by Yukari Tamura

Fun, bouncy, and with more cynical and snide lyrics (since it's sung by Kanako). This song and the accompanying art of Kanako in mahou shoujo costume by Haruhi's Noizi Ito are the only good things to come out of Kanako's existence. (Kanako vaguely resembles Mikuru Asahina in the art.) I love the line "Sekaijuu minna 'oniichan' tte yobaretai no".

4. "Tadaima" (I'm home), Episode 12, "Ore no Imouto no Jinsei Soudan ga Kore de Owaru Wake ga Nai (Good End)", sung by Ayana Taketatsu

A sweet song that works very well as a final ending for the TV series, although the title is more appropriate to the events of Episode 16. It also goes with my absolute favorite piece of art in the series. The art shows Kirino lying in her room surrounded by manga and erogame cases, playing something on her computer (which is an actual Vaio, as opposed to the Laio used in the majority of the series), but it's drawn in a beautiful Nippon Ichi fantasy style with amazing use of shade and color. I love how it begins black and white and the colors fade in as pastel and gradually darken as the ending progresses. 
[It's Vofan! It's the dream collaboration of Bakemonogatari and Ore Imo!]

5. "Maegami" (Bangs), Episode 6, sung by Satomi Satou

Has a nice jazzy rhythm with lots of piano and drum, some trumpet and bass guitar, and some 50's-style backup singing. The lyrics about Manami's feelings toward Kyosuke are adorable and the ending art of Manami worrying about her hair in front of a hand mirror by Sunshine Sketch's Ume Aoki is very cute.

6. "Imouto Please!" (Little sister please!), Episode 1, sung by Ayana Taketatsu

I haven't heard a singer spit out lyrics this fast since Excel Saga! The instrumentals are similar to Maegami, though without the piano and with the addition of some weird stringed instrument I can't identify. The lyrics are all about how much Kirino wants a cute little sister who would sleep with her and take a bath with her, and the song is accompanied by a cute picture of Kirino cuddling a Meruru dakimakura while Meruru and her friend (the one Bridget-chan cosplays in Episode 10) float in the background. 

7. "Orange", Episode 5, sung by Ayana Taketatsu

A cute song about Kirino and Ayase's friendship. The scenario it paints is so convincing that I found myself wondering if that was how Kirino and Ayase became friends. The art is also very nice. I like how the evening sky in the illustration actually is orange, just like it says in the song. The slower songs like this one and "Horaism" tend to play up the childish qualities in Ayana Taketatsu's voice and end up sounding really adorable. 

8. "Horaism", Episode 3, sung by Ayana Taketatsu

Another very cute slower song. Ayana Taketatsu's vocals take center stage, but the instrumentals use acoustic guitar, piano, and that "whrrWHRR" thing that makes the UFO noises in 1950s movies to good effect. (Throw in some violins and you have the instrumental section for a good portion of all anime music.) The lyrics sound like the usual anime "first love" kind of thing, but given the show's record of using lyrics that fit with the theme of an episode, it's possible they're actually non-romantic and aimed at Kyosuke. This ending narrowly beat "Akihabara Dance Now" for this spot because even though I like the song "Akihabara Dance Now" just a tiny bit better, this ending had my second-favorite illustration after the one for "Tadaima", which shows Kirino sitting on her bed twisting her hair around her finger as Kyosuke apparently plays an erogame, done by Na-Ga of Key. (Since I just watched Angel Beats recently, that gives me extra appreciation for Na-Ga's art.)

9. "Akihabara Dance Now!", Episode 11, sung by Hitomi Nabatame with assistance from Ayana Taketatsu and Kana Hanazawa

Hitomi Nabatame can't really hold a tune, but this song is too fun to knock down. It seems to be a tribute to the friendship between Kirino, Kuroneko, and Saori, and the art suggests the same, showing Kirino looking quite happy with one arm around Kuroneko and Saori glomping on her. 

10. "Masquerade", Episode 7, sung by Kana Hanazawa

Perfect as the ending to something like Maschera, with its oppressive Gothic feeling, opening organ riff and random English lines like "Shall we dance". I also enjoyed the art showing an older Kirino and Kuroneko both wearing frilly Gothic dresses (Kirino's looks like a wedding dress), holding masquerade ball masks, and laying in a pile of flower petals. 

11. "Shine", Episode 2, sung by Ayana Taketatsu

A fun beat and nice artwork (the style reminds me a lot of Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko—is it the same artist?), but the lyrics seem a little generic.

12. "Shiroi Kokoro" (White heart), Episode 4, sung by Saori Hayami

The creepy screeching backup singers, oppressive driving percussion beat, and weird discordant piano all give this song the same feeling of horror and fear as "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni", the fittingly titled opening of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. And it's Ayase's ending. That's another major clue that the writers intended her to be crazy. Ayase is surprisingly cute in the illustration, but it's colored in a bleached tone that reminds me of "The Walking Dead" comic book (on superficial inspection), probably because Ayase is psychotic. 

13. "Keep on Runnin'", Episode 16, sung by Ayana Taketatsu

Since I've only watched Episode 16 once and haven't been able to download this song, ranking it is really difficult. It might change later. I didn't want to put it either too high or too low because I don't know enough to have a valid opinion. But I didn't like how it was at the very end of the series because that meant the series was over. I also felt like "Ready" and "Tadaima" were both more satisfying as final endings. "Tadaima" would've fit the actual events of Episode 16 better.

14. "Chameleon Daughter", Episode 8, sung by Hitomi Nabatame

Like I said, Hitomi Nabatame can't really hold a tune, and that hurts things here where energy and fun can't cover up the flaws. The lyrics also seem to fit Kirino more than Saori, unless Saori has some unsuspected chameleon-like qualities (I guess her swirly glasses look sort of like chameleon eyes.) The art is really cute, though; it shows everybody in SD, with Kirino and Kuroneko fighting while Kirino rides on Kyosuke's back and Kuroneko rides on Saori's. 

15. "Inochi Mijikashi Koiseyo Otome" (Life's short, so fall in love, maiden), Episode 14, sung by Kana Hanazawa

Kana Hanazawa has a nice voice and can certainly hold a tune, but the two endings she sings for the Kuroneko phase of the show are a little bit boring. Maybe once I decipher the lyrics I'll find something more to like. I did really like the art, which shows Kuroneko hiding from Kyosuke behind a tree and blushing.

16. "Shokuzai no Serenade" (Serenade of atonement), Episode 15, sung by Kana Hanazawa with assistance from Yuichi Nakamura

Like "Inochi Mijikashi Koiseyo Otome", it feels a little lacking in fun compared with other endings. These two have a vaguely Gothic style, but they don't go all the way with it like "Masquerade". But the art, again, is quite nice; it's done in a Yoshitaka Amano-like style and shows Kuroneko dressed up in her Maschera cosplay from Episode 2, alongside Kyosuke also dressed in Maschera cosplay as the main character (whose costume resembles that of X's Kamui).

** Thoughts on Episode 16, written Sunday, December 11th, 2011, a few days after watching the episode:

I ended up getting lazy and not finishing my character and ending lists until after I had already watched Episode 16, so that's why I included details about it in the character list and had "Keep on Runnin'" in the ending ranking. Anyway, the end of Ore Imo wasn't quite as hard for me as the ending of Aria, but it was still pretty difficult. I've been keeping up with this show for the past two years or so (since it started streaming on ANN—I remember actually having to wait for episodes to come out last year) and every time I watch it, I just enjoy it more. Things that seemed annoying the first time become less annoying, and good things that I never noticed suddenly pop out at me. (Partially this ending wasn't so difficult because there's some hope for an Ore Imo 2, since there's still novel that hasn't been adapted.)

Episode 16 begins with Sena freaking out because her and Kuroneko's game is being panned on the Internet. Kuroneko at first appears indifferent, but it turns out that she's furious and is coming up with a plan to make a game that will somehow destroy all of them. Kyosuke thinks that he can take a rest now that he's gotten Kuroneko a friend. He and Manami run into Kuroneko on the stairs cleaning by herself like in Episode 14, and Manami is surprised when Kyosuke walks by without offering to help her, but then they run into Sena coming up the stairs with cleaning supplies, and hear the two of them cleaning together. 

While leaving school, Kyosuke receives a text message from Kuroneko asking him to come behind the school and meet her. He also receives one from Kirino, who hasn't contacted him in months, telling him to throw away her collection. Puzzled, he tries to call Ayase and ask if she's heard from Kirino, but she's blocked his number. It turns out that she and Manami have met up again since Episode 13 and have apparently become friends, so Manami calls her for Kyosuke. Ayase is angry that he had Manami call because she doesn't want to talk to him (I don't know why she doesn't just kill him). She hasn't heard from Kirino either and is worried that Kirino hates her now, but Kyosuke strongly reassures her that Kirino doesn't hate her and tells her how much Kirino was hurting when they fought in Episode 5. (He probably knows that if Ayase thought Kirino had found another best friend, she would kidnap both Kirino and that friend and imprison them in her dungeon of torture, driving horseshoe nails through each joint on their fingers one by one. Thus, it's a matter of life and death that Ayase doesn't think Kirino hates her.) I absolutely couldn't figure out why Manami and Ayase became friends. Was it just because they wanted to have her block Kyosuke's number, but needed a way to cover the plot hole this created? Manami and Ayase are nothing alike, and Ayase knows that Manami is a friend of Kyosuke, who she detests. The only explanation is that Kirino complained to Ayase about Manami, so she wanted to get close to Manami in case she ever needed to do something terrible to her for Kirino's sake. Maybe this was more clear in the novels. Maybe Ayase is secretly a huge fan of Japanese sweets and Manami got her a case of anpan, or something. 

Afterwards, Kyosuke goes to meet Kuroneko, who says she wanted to thank him for everything he did to make her friends with Sena. She says even though he's a crude, bumbling fool whose shenanigans accomplished absolutely nothing, she appreciates the intent, and she was happy when he said he was worried about her without making her a replacement for Kirino. She also tells him that asking whether he wanted to be called nii-san or senpai was a test for whether he was making her a replacement for his sister; when he said he wanted to be called senpai, she realized he really wasn't putting her in Kirino's place and was happy. Kyosuke tells her about the text message from Kirino and Kuroneko tells him to get the hell out of here and go to Kirino. Before he leaves, she gives him a kiss on the cheek.

Kyosuke goes home, probably with no idea how he's going to get to America, since he usually doesn't think about anything before he does it. Fortunately, their father also received a text message from Kirino telling him to throw away all her track medals and has already made all the preparations to rush off to America and see her. Their mother is trying to stop him since he'll end up missing work. When Kyosuke comes in, he says that he'll go instead, and his father tells him to hurry up and go. 

Kyosuke arrives in America and takes a taxi to the house where Kirino is staying. He knocks on her door and finds her inside. Kirino asks him what he's doing there and why he came, and Kyosuke says he came to play erogames, holding up the copy of Sis x Sis that Kirino gave him in Episode 11. Kirino has a roommate, an elementary school girl, who is out at the track practicing; Kirino insisted that she could practice as well, but the coach made her take a day off. She says that she hasn't been able to play erogames at all because her roommate is always around and she doesn't want to corrupt a younger girl, but she's chafing at not being able to play them. Kyosuke asks why she hasn't contacted anyone in Japan and why she told him to throw away her collection, and Kirino says that she made a vow to herself that she wouldn't talk to anyone in Japan until she was able to beat one of the American runners. She didn't think it would take very long, but it ended up dragging on for months.  She says she feels like anime and erogames are a crutch for her and if she gets rid of them she'll be able to concentrate on track. Kyosuke asks her to come back to Japan with him. Kirino objects and asks why she should, and Kyosuke admits that he's lonely without her around and he wants her to come back. As usual, Kirino doesn't reveal her true feelings and tells him to stop pawing at his little sister (he actually just put his hands on her shoulders while he made a speech about how lonely he was without her, but the emotional intensity and close physical proximity probably made it a little uncomfortable for her, and it was a good deflection so she wouldn't have to show her own feelings). Then she says she has something to do before leaving and goes down to the track.

Kuroneko meets Kyosuke and Kirino at the airport, running in out of breath. Kirino asks if she really missed her that much. I wanted Kuroneko to say yes and surprise Kirino, but she doesn't. Still, they have a cute reunion. Kirino shows Kuroneko a picture of her roommate and says she's the fastest elementary schooler in America, but Kirino was able to beat her just once in sort of a surprise attack. Probably she went down to the track with her mind cleared by playing erogames after so long, happy to  finally hear that Kyosuke missed her while she was gone, and her stubbornness let her sneak in a victory over her roommate. Kyosuke is going to call their father and have him pick them up, but Kirino doesn't want to go home just yet. Instead, they meet Saori (who hugs Kirino) in Akihabara and go to an event for the new Meruru movie. 

As I said, I didn't like that this was the end of Ore Imo. But it was a good ending; Kyosuke finally admitted to Kirino that he cares about her and she isn't a nuisance to him, and despite what Kuroneko says, her actions make it clear to Kirino that she missed her. (By the way, during the scene in Kirino's room in America, Kirino says the exact thing about Kuroneko that Kuroneko said about her—she was "getting tired of that woman". It's just as much of a lie as when Kuroneko said it.) In the end, Kirino decided that her friends and family were more important to her than track. (Also anime and erogames. Without the friends and family part, this would just be another life destroyed by anime and erogames.) As far as the main part of the story, the relationship between Kirino and Kyosuke, the series is pretty much done after this. They may never have sat down and said "You're important to me" to each other, but each has now admitted it to the other in some way (Kirino in Episode 11, Kyosuke here), and though they'll probably keep fighting in the future, they have a solid relationship. The Kuroneko subplot also feels pretty complete with her friendship with Sena. But there were other parts of the story that I wanted to see: I wanted to learn more about Saori, and find out whether Ayase ever kills anyone and what common household item she does it with, and see what happens when Sena and Kirino meet (it won't be pretty, especially if Sena starts with the "otaku aren't really discriminated against" stuff). I feel like there's still story here, even if the major part of it has been completed. I don't know if we need twelve more episodes of Ore Imo, but another four or five OVA episodes would be nice. As long as they don't go the way of the Angel Beats OVA.

In lieu of that, though, I'd be perfectly happy if the novels would come out in English. Sometimes the anime ends up being better than the novels (Spice and Wolf is an example; Gosick is another), but I'd still be satisfied with that. Two years ago, I was actually getting tired of anime. I had seen and enjoyed Haruhi, Kanon, Clannad, and Fate/Stay Night, but Haruhi and Fate were both over, I was disappointed in the endings of Kanon and Clannad (unjustly, I think), and I was having trouble finding anything that seemed exciting. Then I downloaded the first episode of Ore Imo. Its cleverness and realism were a huge surprise. I got to the point where I only went to class because afterwards, I could sit in the library and watch Ore Imo. When there wasn't a new episode out, I would either watch old episodes or try to find out when the new one came out. It was the first fansub I ever watched, the first show I ever watched streaming, and it was the show that convinced me it was worthwhile to try to watch fansubs or streams instead of sitting through whatever mediocre stuff from three years ago happened to be stocked by Netflix. It reinvigorated my interest in anime with its mixture of realism, clever jokes, good writing, cute characters, nice art, and moe. Sure, it had a few bad spots, but the rest was so good that it's not hard to overlook those. It was simultaneously one of the most otaku-targeted shows I've ever watched and one of the least pandering shows I've ever watched. It made me remember why I like anime: because, as the song says, "Suki nan da mon!"

** Thoughts on the Ore Imo manga, Volume 1, written Monday, October 8th, 2012:

What I thought was a US release for the Ore Imo novels was actually the Ore Imo manga. Not that I dislike manga, but I was really hoping to get the source material.

The manga doesn't do anything revolutionary in terms of story, but the manga author, Sakura Ikeda, used an art style that's interestingly different from the anime or the novels, and added lots of little touches and details into the scenes that made it more interesting than, say, the Haruhi Suzumiya manga (of course, by the time I read that, I'd already seen the anime and read the novels, so I wasn't in the mood to see the same story again). 

As you may have guessed from her name, Sakura Ikeda is a woman. Given that, I found her artistic choices interesting. It seems like when women work on manga and anime aimed at men, they tend to use a more cute art style, delivering fan service with costumes and accessories and deemphasizing the nudity and sexual aspects of the art. That was the approach CLAMP used in Chobits and Kobato; that was what distinguished the art of Itaru Hinoue from other Key artists; and that was my first clue that Kozue Amano of Aria and Satoko Kiyuzuki of GA and Shoulder-a-Coffin Kuro were women (the second was, duh, their names are Kozue and Satoko, like Kozue Takanashi and Satoko Hojo. The writing in those series also seemed somehow feminine, in the best possible sense). I should mention that I really like it when women work on manga and anime aimed at men; some of my favorite works ever are in or implicated in the above list. I would have included Card Captor Sakura, but it just accidentally ended up with men as a freak fringe audience. The point is, Sakura Ikeda does the opposite of all those fine female creators; she actually redraws the Ore Imo characters as more adult and sexy in appearance than in the anime or original novels, and frequently shows them in sexy poses or from exposing angles, sometimes where it makes no sense or comes out anatomically shaky. In this, she reminds me somewhat of Michelangelo's later work, where he drew his men in a very exaggerated style and put them in strange, back-breaking poses. Even the little sisters in Kirino's games have voluptuous bodies, and Manami went from genuinely plain in the anime to stunning in the manga.

The art does have some more shoujo-like touches to it, such as the amount of detail that goes into making the girls' lips plump and full, something that's often overlooked by male artists (although Ken Akamatsu is a notable exception). In fact, the mature appearance of the characters gives an effect that's pretty similar to CLAMP's shoujo stuff, like X or Tokyo Babylon, or some of the characters in Honey and Clover (the ones that aren't Hagu). The characters do go SD every so often, and that's handled well. The new art style was one of the points of interest that made me like the Ore Imo manga despite having seen the anime. For one thing, Kirino actually looks like a fashion model now (well, she's much too busty to be a supermodel, but she looks like the kind of model you might see in a Victoria's Secret catalogue). Her clothes are even more skimpy than in the anime, and fan servicey scenes like when she's searching under Kyosuke's bed or when she's on top of him asking for life counseling become pumped up to maximum fan service. And as I mentioned, Manami got a huge upgrade. In the anime, she actually was sort of plain compared to the other characters, and her glasses and hairstyle were very unfashionable. In the manga, she has wire frames, a somewhat better hair stylist, huge, deep eyes, a cuter, more expressive manner, and a sexy, buxom body. She also has a tendency to sprout dog ears and a tail when she's excited, making her 100% cuter than she was in the anime. Of course, Manami isn't supposed to be like this, so maybe it's not such a good thing. By the way, the biggest beneficiary of the new art style aside from Kirino is Kuroneko. Now she actually looks like a shoujo manga character, and they don't have to call in a guest artist to make her look like she came right out of the apocalypse of X. She also seems to have grown taller, although that may just be because of Ikeda's weird sense of space (or lack thereof).

The writing also had some points of interest. Where Manami became more expressive, Kirino is actually less expressive. When she's being mean to Kyosuke, manga Kirino seems to be less likely to yell and hit; instead, she tends to speak coldly and use her words to hurt him. Part of this is the absence of Ayana Taketatsu's very loud, very angry voice, but it also comes through in the poses and expressions that she makes when she's cutting down Kyosuke. She's still quite expressive when she's happy, though. 

Some of the conversations flow a little better than in the anime. When Kirino first reveals her otaku-ness to Kyosuke, both versions include a scene where Kirino crawls up on Kyosuke suggestively. This scene is even more suggestive in the manga (the amping up of fan service referred to above), but it happens because Kirino is trying to prevent Kyosuke from running off by physically trapping him, whereas it happened in the anime for no apparent reason. The conversation between Kirino and Kuroneko after the offline meeting also moves along a little more easily. I really liked having Kyosuke's voiceover (text-over) narration—not only did it introduce some of the details of the story that were not properly introduced in the anime, such as Kyosuke's father being a police officer, it also let us see a little more of Kyosuke's character, and hear some of his opinions on things. I thought it was funny to see that Kyosuke believes that Kirino takes after their father, while he believes that he takes after their mother, who wonders who he takes after. Kyosuke had a monologue in the anime, but it was used almost exclusively for vital plot information, whereas manga Kyosuke has a constant monologue similar to Kyon's in Haruhi Suzumiya. 

** Thoughts on the Ore Imo novels, begun Monday, January 21st, 2013, finished Tuesday, January 22nd:

After I ran out of Monogatari novels on Baka-Tsuki, I decided to give the original Ore Imo novels a chance. I figured they would be a lot like the manga—pretty close to the anime, with a few interesting twists. 

I was wrong. The Ore Imo novels, like the Monogatari novels, actually add information to what was presented in the anime, but to an even greater degree than the Monogatari novels. In fact, some characters—especially Kyousuke—almost come off like different people in the novels than in the anime. Unlike Bakemonogatari or Haruhi, which include voiceover narration that give us at least a hint of what the main character is thinking, the Ore Imo anime lets Kyousuke's actions speak for themselves, and they really don't tell us what he's thinking. 

I described Kyousuke above as crude and dense, and that really was how he came off in the anime. He's still somewhat dense in the novels, but some of his actions that seemed particularly crude and dense actually don't come off that way when you have his explanation. In particular, the way he handled their father was notably different from how it was in the anime. In the anime, Kyousuke sat across from their father and yelled at him. I didn't understand how he avoided getting yelled at or punched for as long as he did. In the novel, Kyousuke doesn't begin by yelling. After Kirino runs out, there's a scene where their father talks to Kyousuke, telling him that he knows Kyousuke knew about Kirino's hobby. Kyousuke describes being so scared he's about to wet himself when he's trying to stand up to his father, and says he can't even believe what he's doing. Similarly, Ayase's sudden turn to the psychotic does not escape Kyousuke when they run into her outside Comiket, and when he confronts her in the park, he talks about being scared out of his wits. It seems like, rather than being someone who resorts quickly to yelling, Kyousuke in the novels is simply so scared of what he's doing that he temporarily loses his mind and goes into a frenzy, but still manages to persuade people because he thought out what he wanted to say beforehand. He even says early on that he's scared of Kirino. Kyousuke comes off as sort of a wimp in the anime, so finding out that he was a full-fledged wimp in the source material makes sense. I actually like him more, because his actions are easier to understand. Also, it's made more clear in the novels that Kyousuke has some of the same tsundere tendencies as Kirino and has trouble admitting to himself that he does things because he cares about people, which is the reason for his constant claims that he doesn't really want to help Kirino, he's just doing what he wants, which happens to coincide with helping her.

The relationship between Kyousuke and Manami is also more clear in the novels; Kyousuke regards Manami as the healer of his spirit, the guardian of his calm, unchanging life. During the second novel, there's an incident where Manami suddenly becomes uncommunicative and disappears for a few days; Kyousuke freaks out, yells at her brother trying to find out what happened, and finally asks Kirino for advice, little as he wants to. He tries talking to Kirino like when she first came to ask his advice, but she won't put up with it; when he tries saying "Shh! Do you know what time it is?" she slams the door on him, and when he says "Promise you won't make fun of me?", she says of course she'll make fun of him. Kirino concludes that he offended Manami when they ran into Ayase on the street (before she went Hinamizawa) and he implicitly compared Manami unfavorably with Ayase (he smoothed it over with his usual line about how he doesn't want her to change). Kirino suggests giving her money, a lovely piece of advice courtesy of Kanako (Kyousuke is able to figure out that she was the one talking crap about him when all of Kirino's friends were over), but when he balks, Kirino changes her suggestion to a present of some kind. Recalling that Manami said she was collecting pillows, Kyousuke uses the Internet and finds her a nice pillow, and of course it turns out to have all been a misunderstanding. This experience informs Kyousuke's response to the incident between Ayase and Kirino, and when he talks to her about it on the couch, he's actually much more understanding and subtle than he was in the anime. 

Another major difference with Kyousuke is that we see his gradual transformation into an otaku—I just watched the Kuroneko arc episodes from the anime again recently, and was reminded of how jarring it was when Kyousuke knew that Maschera's season had ended, or called himself an erogamer and suggested making one. As in the anime, he decides pretty early that Saori and Kuroneko are good people, and shortly after that he likes them himself. In fact, during the Ayase incident, Ayase makes it much more clear that she believes Kyousuke was the original otaku and he got Kirino into it; when Kyousuke confronts Ayase, he brings up Kuroneko and Saori, saying they were his friends and good people, to get some justice for them after Kirino pretended not to know them. Also, there's a weird scene at Comiket where Kyousuke freaks out because he sees someone cosplaying Cell from Dragon Ball Z, which he apparently loves (the translator obviously doesn't, and sneaks in lots of snide footnotes about it. I've made my peace with Dragon Ball Z; it got pretty bad towards the end, and it was always pretty ridiculous, but it had its good points, at least for what it was, like reasonably likable characters and a few decent plotlines. By the way, the early Cell stuff was one of the better Dragon Ball Z stories, so I guess I can sort of understand why Kyousuke would be into the Cell cosplay). 

Kirino is about the same, although she seems a little more straightforward with her hints about wanting to get closer to Kyousuke. There are also a few more insinuations that her feelings about him might have a romantic element, especially in Volume 3, which I'm still in the middle of reading. The short conversation between Kyousuke and Kuroneko, during which Kuroneko asks Kyousuke why he does so much for such a terrible sister and Kyousuke says it's just because they're siblings took place on the train at the end of Episode 8 in the anime, but in the novels it happened after the anime viewing party from Episode 7, and Kirino is just in the other room and hears what they're saying. She latches on to Kuroneko's suggestion that he's a siscon and starts constantly calling him a gross siscon, but always with a certain delight that belies her words. 

The most obvious and cutest example takes place during the data-gathering excursion on Christmas Eve. The book Kirino writes is more of a terrible over-the-top soap opera-type thing than what she wrote in the anime, although the main character does have a cute little sister named Shiori-chan. Kyousuke actually gets to see her notes while they're walking around Shibuya. The main character of the book has three boyfriends. The first gets run over by a dump truck. The second is the married president of a venture capital corporation who's cheating on his wife with the middle school-aged main character (Kirino says that no middle school girl wants to date boys her own age because middle school boys are basically monkeys, and that second year of high school is the lower bound on age for a decent boyfriend); he gets found out and leaves her. The third boyfriend is a second-year high school student who is poor because he refuses to rely on his rich family and spends all his money on his band. Kyousuke thinks he's based on Kirino herself because she wrote that he tries hard at everything, but she also threw in that early on, her main character speaks cruelly to him because she wants to drive him off, since everyone she falls in love with dies or goes away. Yet this third boyfriend is always kind to her despite her cruel words, and does his best to take care of her, eventually leading her to fall in love with him. That part was obviously based on Kyousuke, although Kyousuke himself just thinks that the guy is an idiot to stick with a girl like that (maybe he is, since it's not his sister who he's stuck with anyway). Also, the boyfriend is a second-year in high school just like Kyousuke, and from Kirino's perspective, Kyousuke is always trying hard and doing his best, achieving results like reuniting Kirino with Ayase and getting their father to let her keep her collection. Kirino even made the boyfriend poor because she wanted to write the scene where Kyousuke doesn't have enough money to buy her the expensive accessory using this boyfriend. This may or may not mean that Kirino's feelings towards Kyousuke have romantic undertones, but at least, it shows that she's somewhat aware of the real situation between the two of them, unlike the oblivious Kyousuke who keeps insisting that he hates Kirino and their relationship hasn't gotten any better. The part about putting up with the main character's cruel words was the real piece of evidence proving that this character was based on Kyousuke.

Kuroneko is actually meaner in the novels than she was in the anime. In the anime, I don't remember her ever being mean to Kyousuke, but in the novels she tells him some pretty horrible things just like Kirino would, and she's meaner to Saori as well. But Kyousuke also realizes, from the way she talks about her little sisters, that she's in the same position he is and completely understands why he does so much for Kirino. All Kuroneko had to do with Kyousuke's answer that he does it all because Kirino is his sister was put herself in his position and think about whether she would still love her sisters even if they were horrible to her, like Kirino is to Kyousuke. She clearly thinks the answer is yes, because she shows on a few occasions that she understands Kyousuke pretty well. 

By the way, in the very late novels there are some short stories that have been translated. I read two of them. One is from the perspective of Kuroneko's middle sister, who is sad because their youngest sister writes a paper about how much she loves Kuroneko and barely even mentions her other older sister. The other is a retread of Chapter 1 of the first novel written from Kirino's point of view. In it, Kirino more clearly states that she and Kyousuke were close when they were younger, and even claims that she used to call him "Onii-chan" (which seems plausible), though she now thinks of him as "that guy" (she settles on calling him "Kyousuke" so her narration is easier to read). She doesn't actually tell us why they became estranged either, though I imagine it was sort of a double whammy of Kyousuke being jealous that Kirino is good at everything and gets praised while he is regarded as useless and Kirino being jealous that Kyousuke started hanging out with Manami all the time. Kyousuke admits during the final chapter of Volume 3 (which I read just after writing the above) that he's had a gnawing jealousy towards Kirino that he couldn't put into words. For Kirino's part, she's a hot-tempered person who usually translates all her emotions into anger, so I can imagine there being some incident where she got mad at Kyousuke because he wasn't spending time with her and then wouldn't tell him why she was mad and just told him to go off and play with Manami. By the way, her descriptions in this story are all horrible, but pretty funny; she talks about how Kyousuke always looks depressed and like he's going to kill himself, and how he wouldn't be bad-looking if not for those dead eyes of his. The story ends just as she enters his room to ask for the first life consultation.

The novel-writing subplot ends rather differently than it did in the anime. In the anime, Kirino's novel was published and picked up to be an anime, leading to the rather horrible Episode 8. In the novel, Kirino meets with an editor who seemed interested in publishing her novel, but when she finishes it and posts it to the web site, and gives the editor the password to access it, the editor changes the password and publishes it as the work of someone else. Kirino, who's been working day and night and has developed a cold from overworking herself, says she doesn't care and she's going to try again with another novel. Kyousuke, however, won't leave it alone, so he contacts Saori and Kuroneko for help.

All they have to go on is a business card with the fake editor's name, Kumagai Ryuunosuke; they determine that the fake probably stole it from a real editor, since the company is reputable and the card matches the cards Saori has seen in the past from that company. Saori uses her connections to schedule a meeting with an editor for Kyousuke and Kuroneko; their nominal reason for going is that they're submitting an application to have Kuroneko's doujin novel about Maschera published. During a chance meeting with a friendly passing editor, Kuroneko claims that Kyousuke is her brother and starts calling him "Nii-san". The friendly editor is a fan of Maschera and really enjoyed Kuroneko's work, but the actual editor they're meeting, who is described as looking like Akuma from Street Fighter, didn't like it at all and spends four hours telling Kuroneko how bad it was. Afterwards, he realizes he went too far and offers them pudding, and tells Kuroneko not to be in too big a hurry to debut and to accumulate life experience. During her lambasting, Kuroneko became all cute and shy and depressed, but then recovers and tells the editor he's being sentimental and patronizing. They discover that he's the real Kumagai Ryuunosuke. It turns out that a failed writer he's been advising for ten years, Iori Fate Setsuna, stole Kirino's novel by posing as Kumagai Ryuunosuke. He arranges a meeting to let them prove it, and Kuroneko heaps lots of abuse on Fate (this was the source of much of her speech to the anime directors in the anime) before Kyousuke reveals their proof, the sequel to Kirino's novel, which was hidden on the personal side of the site under a separate password and was not stolen. In true Kirino fashion, the sequel is written from the little sister's point of view. The editor determines that Kirino is the true writer and says he'll probably have to resign over this. Kyousuke can't escape from a chapter without losing his mind and raving, so he raves that he's the one who's really worthless, and that even though Fate and Kuroneko haven't been able to publish anything, at least they work hard on something. In the end, Kirino never finds out about what Kyousuke and Kuroneko did for her, and they all gather to have another anime-viewing party, with Saori coming over for the first time. 

I can't figure out why they ditched this story for the anime. The purpose it served was almost identical to that served by Episode 8, but it was much more interesting and gave us some nice scenes for Kuroneko, who seemed to be the most popular character in the anime and was certainly underexposed before the OVA episodes. It was especially adorable when Kuroneko and Kyousuke were claiming to be siblings, and they even went in to confront Fate claiming that Kirino was their youngest sister (the novels confirm that Kuroneko and Saori are both in their third year of middle school, while Kirino is in her second year, so Kuroneko is older). Also, the scene where Kuroneko gets her work lambasted was a nice moe scene, especially after the first editor got her hopes up (Kuroneko's work may be genuinely terrible, but her style makes it super-niche even if it's not bad, so it makes sense that there would be a few people who understand it out there). Also, Kyousuke didn't have to get down on the floor and bow before anyone; the poor guy may be a wimp, but that's no reason to humiliate him any more than he already was. In every way, this was a better story than the corresponding anime episode, and if they couldn't fit it all into one episode (I think they could have if they'd cut a few minor things), I wish they would've bumped Episode 10 for it. (I would have said also Episode 6, but since Manami didn't have that other story earlier on, that would've taken away all her exposure, and I won't be that mean. But Ayase already got an entire episode, and who gives a damn about Kanako, so Episode 10 could have gone and made way for more Kuroneko.)

** Thoughts on the fourth and fifth novels, Tuesday, January 29th, 2013:

These novels pretty much follow exactly the "True Route" of the anime, and seeing that Episode 9 didn't exist in the novels actually makes a lot of sense to me now; Episode 9 was the anime's way of hinting at a bunch of the character development which took place gradually in the novels, but which couldn't be gotten into the anime because it had either been cut, like Kuroneko's parts in the novel-writing adventure or the various hints that she had sisters and helped out a lot at home, or had been conveyed as observations Kyousuke made through his narration. I still like that episode, but it did contradict something that the novel stands firm on—that Kirino isn't very interested in the sex scenes in her eroge, and really does only care about the adorableness, which Kyousuke mentions when they play 'Onii-chan no Pantsu nanka Zettai Nusunde nai n Dakara ne?!'.

All of the good parts of the anime episodes—the touching scene where Kirino gives Kyousuke his present and thanks him for all his help, the shock everyone feels when Kirino runs off suddenly, the interactions between Kuruneko and Kyousuke in their new relationship as senpai and kouhai—were exactly as good in the novel, no more and no less. But the novel versions did have several interesting side trips that weren't in the anime. For one thing, while watching Episode 14, I noticed that when Kyousuke introduces Kuroneko to Manami, Kuroneko recoils and whispers "Belphegor...", which, as we saw in Episode 9, is the name of some demon king in the alternate reality of Kuroneko's brain. She then acts angry and cagey throughout the scene, which I had assumed was just her pride and usual semi-tsundere attitude. In the novel, we get a different perspective.

In Episode 11, Kuroneko showed a manga she had drawn that was essentially about Kyousuke and Kirino, except Kirino sniffed Kyousuke's underwear and dragged out all his porn books, complaining that none of them were about little sisters. Then both siblings teamed up to put her down, against her protests that they were about to start a holy war for the fate of mankind. In the novel, Kyousuke decides, more after his usual style, that he'll just have to put up with it, and Kuroneko showcases the whole manga, in which it so happens that the evil Manami Tamura is the avatar of the demon king Belphegor, and must steal Kyousuke, holder of the demon Lucifer, in order to complete an evil plan. Kirino somehow stops her using demonic powers and gets back Kyousuke. Obviously, the only way Kuroneko could know about Manami is from Kirino (we even saw Kirino tell her and Saori a little about Manami in Episode 6). When Kuroneko meets Manami in the novel and recoils, whispering "Belphegor...", Kyousuke figures out pretty quickly that Kirino told her a bunch of things about Manami and Kuroneko is taking Kirino's side in the dispute. She is angry the whole time because she doesn't like Manami. I honestly wouldn't have expected this of Kuroneko, no matter how close she is with Kirino, but it's cute that she developed a dislike for Manami based solely on her friend's jealousy. It's the closest thing Kuroneko has ever done to coming up to an Ayase-level of friendship devotion. I also liked how it confirmed my suspicion that Kirino told her friends things about the relationship she wanted with her brother that she didn't ever let on to Kyousuke; if she told Kuroneko, it's also plausible that she told Ayase, though perhaps Kuroneko was more interested since she knows Kyousuke. It was also funny, especially once I knew the whole story; only an otaku could recoil and whisper "Belphegor..." in that situation.

I haven't actually finished reading the fifth novel yet, so I'm not sure if it goes all the way up to the final episode of the anime, but it seems to be on track to finish with the Kuroneko arc. 

** The end of the fifth novel and good news, Tuesday, March 5th, 2013:

The fifth novel does go exactly to the end of the OVA, when Kyousuke goes to fetch Kirino and bring her home. That particular scene doesn't go exactly as it did in the anime—for one thing, Kirino is actually ill in the novel—but the differences are pretty minor. 

I actually want to backtrack a little bit to the the novel's take on Episode 10. It should be well known by now that I hate Kanako. The anime sort of waffles and makes it look like maybe you're supposed to find her funny and cute or maybe she's just annoying, but the novel is pretty unambiguous about how horrible Kanako is. At the end of the cosplay contest, she whips out a cigarette and starts puffing away. Kyousuke thinks how disgusting she is and starts calling her "that shitty brat" and thinking all sorts of terrible (but fair) things about her. Even Ayase seems to hate her, and Kirino never seems to care that much whether she's around or not, even failing to recognize her during the cosplay contest, so I'm not sure why they hang out with her. The first chapter of the sixth novel shows Ayase and Kirino's reunion, which Kyousuke describes as romantic in appearance, adding yet another hint of yuri to Ayase and Kirino's friendship. After that, Ayase tells Kyousuke that she wants his help and asks him to disguise himself as an agent again and go with Kanako to her latest contest and make sure she doesn't smoke. I'm not sure why Ayase cares whether Kanako smokes (maybe because Kanako is now part of her and Kirino's agency, so it makes the agency look bad if they have middle school girls smoking at their events), but the conversation she has with Kyousuke suggests that she isn't fond of Kanako, and she certainly had no compunction about manipulating Kanako and getting her arrested just so she could have a present for Kirino.

Even though Kyousuke is afraid of Ayase (because he perceives her psychotic side during the novel's version of Episode 4, and remains afraid of her all the way through, having sensed her murderous qualities), Kyousuke also apparently finds Ayase attractive; at one point he mentions that his perfect girl would have Ayase's looks and Manami's personality. That could be why he helps her even though she still hates him; it could also be that he's afraid she'll stick a barbecue fork in his back if he refuses.

By the way, I read that this April, a sequel anime called Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai. (with a period) will be airing. Since the sixth novel goes up to the end of the OVA, the second series should cover novels that haven't been translated yet, so that will be nice. I have heard that Kyousuke ends up going out with Kuroneko during the next few novels; I don't mind the idea of those two being together (and I'm sure Kirino will be happy that Kyousuke is with a girl who will induce him to spend time with her instead of taking him away from her), but it could be a difficult game to play; although I think Fushimi is a good writer, there's no question for me that Nisio Isin is better, yet he couldn't handle Koyomi and Hitagi going out without letting it interfere with other parts of the story. He mostly got away with it because Hitagi was the main heroine and everyone loved her; everyone seems to like Kuroneko, but Kirino is the main heroine, so I'm wondering if she'll recede in importance due to Kyousuke and Kuroneko going out. I hope not; I came to really like Kirino over the couple years I've been following Ore Imo, which is almost a complete turnaround from how I felt when I first started watching it. While I do like Kuroneko, I found that I missed Kirino during the OVA episodes when she was gone, so I hope she still has a significant part during the next series and next few novels.

** Thoughts on Episode 1 of Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai., written Tuesday, April 16th, 2013:

Hereafter I will just refer to this as "the second series", because that period is too hard to read. Crunchyroll is simulcasting this, but all non-premium members have to wait a week to watch the episodes so I was only able to see the first one, although the second is also posted. Because it's Ore Imo, I decided to take a break from Little Busters and check it out (though I then also watched an episode of Little Busters).

I sense large story divergence between the novels and anime here. Although it didn't go so well last time the anime tried it, they may be able to pull it off this time. After all, they opened the first episode with an adorable scene that wasn't in the sixth novel (as so far translated). Kyousuke, as a child, is in the bath, when little adorable Kirino comes in and says "Oniichan, I'm coming in". Kyousuke complains that he doesn't want to take a bath with his sister and hanging out with her is uncool because she's slow and needs him to wash her hair, and Kirino angrily retaliates that he's lucky to have such a wonderful sister as her. Kyousuke wakes up on the floor, as he did in the first series after dreaming about Kirino as a typical anime little sister. Although it isn't clear whether this was a memory or just a dream, it fits with what's been implied about Kyousuke and Kirino as kids, and if Kyousuke thoughtlessly said a bunch of mean things to Kirino, that could have made her angry, which might have spurred her to become perfect, which would have made him angry since he thought she was useless, and could have been the birth of their bad relationship.

Kyousuke tells Manami that he's distressed because Kirino is acting the same towards him as she did before; he thought since he dragged her back from America, it might destroy their relationship. Manami tells him it's fine (really, when has he ever made Kirino do anything she didn't want to?) and asks what else is bothering him, since he said there a couple things; Kyousuke won't tell her about the other things. (The fact that he told her anything shows that he's grown as a person and come to respect Manami more; Manami had to wheedle him to get him to talk about what was going on in the early parts of the first series.) It turns out that the other thing bothering him is Kuroneko; she kissed him in the last OVA episode, which he guesses amounts to a love confession, but now she gets angry at him for talking to her when she's trying to work on a game. Remembering when she said that she likes him as much as Kirino does, Kyousuke tries calling Kirino and asking how much she likes him. Of course, she doesn't tell him—in fact, she gets mad at him for calling her when it's not an emergency—but although asking Kirino this was a moderately stupid idea, at least it suggests that he doesn't believe what he thought at the time, that Kirino doesn't like him at all, meaning Kuroneko doesn't like him at all. (Kuroneko might have heard something from Kirino to give her a better idea of how much Kirino likes him than he had himself, so asking Kirino wasn't a completely stupid idea, but he should have known she'd never answer a question like that with the truth.)

Kirino and Ayase have their pseudo-romantic reunion, although it's at the school rather than at Kirino and Kyousuke's house, and Kanako asks once again if they're lesbians. Ayase becomes quite chagrined; she even smacks Kanako across the head for making a snide remark about Kirino coming back so soon. The anime probably can't do the story from the novels about Kyousuke stopping Kanako from smoking, because they cut the smoking scene from Episode 10, but this still showed what that story suggested, that Ayase doesn't like Kanako. It probably won't be long before someone finds Kanako with a screwdriver through her lung.

Kyousuke and Kirino happen to get up for drinks in the middle of the night at the same time (I suspect Kirino was actually coming over to see him and happened to catch him leaving his room). They awkwardly converse for a minute in the living room, and Kyousuke asks if Kirino is done receiving life advice. Kirino says she doesn't know and goes back to bed; the next morning she slaps him awake and says she needs life advice. She drags him around Akihabara, buying enough eroge to stock her own store, then kicks him out so she can play, though as a 'reward' she lets him play one of the games she bought first. The game happens to have the tagline 'Arigatou Oniichan' on the back of the case; as usual, Kirino is letting her eroge speak for her and express her true feelings to Kyousuke. She screams that she has returned to her kingdom and ruins the warm feeling Kyousuke experiences as he sits and reads the words 'Arigatou Oniichan'.

The next episode seems to focus on Ayase; from what I understand, there's a fairly hefty Ayase plot arc in one of the later novels, so maybe this is it. While Episode 10 was a decent showcase of Ayase's evil and Episode 4's shocking revelation of her psychotic nature is still the classic, Ayase needed to be scheduled for a hefty plotline as the other second-tier heroine alongside Manami. As for this episode, it was sort of a transition episode without a lot of plot material, but there were some great moments, like the childhood flashback scene and the end where Kyousuke notices 'Arigatou Oniichan' on the game case. I reckon that the Kuroneko situation will occupy much of this series, and the groundwork for that was also laid. 

(I'm aiming to let the Ore Imo file overtake the Bakemonogatari file in size.)

** Thoughts on Episode 2 of Ore Imo II, written Sunday, May 5th, 2013:

I had mixed feelings about this episode and went back and forth a lot while I was watching it. Ore Imo has always had its moments where it went too far with the hyper-realism and got into trouble, but I felt like this episode may have gone even further than the show had in the past. On the other hand, it's just a bit easier to take because it's comedic, not dramatic as in Episode 8 of the first series.

Kirino has become obsessed with a new game in which you can talk to and text with the heroine. It's so bad that she blows off Ayase or sits across from Ayase in cafes and ignores her to play the game. Ayase goes to Kyousuke for help and asks him to find out how she can win back Kirino's attention. Kyousuke gets Kirino to tell him about the game, then mentions that she shouldn't ignore her real friends over it, so Kirino loans it to him so she won't be tempted to play it. Kyousuke becomes obsessed with the game and loses his mind, talking to it lovingly like a creepy otaku and chasing off Manami when she walks in on him doing it. He tells Ayase that since the heroine looks like her and sounds like her, she can probably catch Kirino's attention by acting more like the heroine. Ayase interprets his attempts to make her talk like the heroine of the game as sexual harassment and kicks him in the head, then cries to Manami about it. Ayase and Manami hatch a plan to win back their respective members of the Kousaka family by acting like the heroine from the game. First Manami ambushes Kyousuke outside the house and says she couldn't wait to see him again, causing Kyousuke to call her creepy. He pulls her behind a wall when he sees Ayase coming, her hair up in a braid with a ribbon on it like the game heroine. Ayase ambushes Kirino and pulls the same routine, but then adds some lines from the game's yandere route and says that to be with Kirino, she would gladly kill Kanako, then suggests killing Kyousuke together. Kirino says that even she doesn't hate him that much. She and Ayase make up after Kirino apologizes, but Kirino makes Ayase cry when she also calls the routine creepy and has to run off after her.

I liked how this episode went a little further with the yuri undertones between Kirino and Ayase, such as when Kyousuke says that the game allows the player to become lovers with a girl who looks and sounds like Ayase and Ayase interprets that to mean that Kirino wishes for the two of them to become lovers. I had a hard time believing that Ayase would actually say those yandere lines to Kirino, but at the same time, it was a pretty funny joke because Ayase actually does have a yandere-type personality, and it got us another reference to her dislike for Kanako. I also thought the scene with Manami and Ayase was really cute. It's weird how Ayase became friends with Manami despite Kirino's dislike for her, but maybe Kirino actually didn't tell Ayase as much about Manami as she did Kuroneko, so Ayase didn't know that Manami was supposedly the enemy. She seems to look up to Manami, and calls her "Onee-san", and she seemed comfortable in Manami's house, as if she'd been there before. 

The biggest thing I was unsure of with this episode was how Kyousuke acted. On the one hand, I wasn't sure how well it fit him to become obsessed with a game and lose his mind. On the other hand, we've seen him slowly become a bigger and bigger otaku as the series has gone on, and we've also seen him lose his mind plenty of times, usually when he had to talk someone into something and had no idea how to convince them, so it's not totally implausible. 

Sequel series often seem to start in a bit of a slump; every time I watch Aria: The Natural, I have trouble getting into the first few episodes, especially Episodes 4-10 or so. But Aria: The Natural became just as brilliant as its predecessor by the middle, with excellent episodes like the one where Aika and Alice follow Akari on the vaporetto or the one where Alice tries to get home by walking on shadows, so I still have hope for Ore Imo II, even though the first two episodes were sort of underwhelming. 

** Thoughts on Episode 3 of Ore Imo II, written Saturday, May 11th, 2013:

I still feel like the series is in a bit of  a slump, but it picked up a little with this episode, which treated good material, although I don't think it did so in the best way it could have.

Episode 3 centers on Saori;  it begins with Kyousuke, Kirino, and Kuroneko showing up at her apartment to surprise her for her birthday and running into her as she comes home, in her school uniform and without her crazy swirly glasses. Saori gets shy all of a sudden and tries to hide herself from being seen; Kyousuke (apparently jokingly) asks "Who are you?"

The rest of the episode is a flashback showing how Saori came to be the otaku organizer that she is. As a child, she was sickly, shy, and adorable. One day, her irresponsible older sister dragged her off to an apartment she'd rented for the purpose of hosting her doujin circle, which included Shinya, a former chuunibyou who reminded me heavily of the main hero from Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai; the maid who served Kyousuke at the cafe in Episode 2; and Kanata, apparently the older sister of the much-loathed Kanako and also a doujin artist with several pennames and a penchant for hideous men's shirts and crazy swirly glasses, as well as an archaic manner of speech. Saori was a shy girl who had a hard time being around so many people, but she gradually became friends with all of them, especially Kanata. However, her sister ran off one day to get married and everyone slowly drifted away. Saori went to Italy to yell at her sister for breaking everything up, and her sister sneered and said she was nothing to them but their friend's little sister, making Saori angrily swear to form an even better circle in vengeance. She parted tearfully from Kanata, who imparted her crazy swirly glasses to Saori, and ordered a supply of hideous men's shirts and began the Otaku Girls Unite group, attracting Kuroneko and Kirino.

The episode ends with Saori's sister, Kaori, coming in and Saori leaving some snide comments and a birthday present; Shinya, the maid, and Kanata also come to visit, and Kanata asks if Saori has accomplished her goal of forming a much more awesome circle yet. Saori says no, but she's happy with her friends. Kanata says she wants to hang out with them all next time and goes with Saori and the others to catch up, and Saori enjoys a fun birthday party where she makes everyone cosplay. (Kirino eagerly agrees to put on Kuroneko's outfit; Kuroneko grudgingly tries on a character from Meruru; and Kyousuke gets browbeaten into wearing the outfit of the main hero from Maschera, as he did in the picture for Shokuzai no Serenade in the first series.) 

Although I liked every individual piece of this episode, I wasn't totally satisfied with the way they all fit together. The segue from present to past was pretty clumsy. I think I would've liked it better if the prologue had been more of a personal moment; maybe we could've seen Saori by herself that morning, without seeing her face as in Episode 9, and moved into the flashback as she went to school, then caught up with her again as she came home and found her friends outside. I think that would have had a better flow to it. I also would've liked it if we could have had a little time to see Saori's old friends mingle with her new friends; at least, they could have had her introduce Kanata to them, and maybe Kirino could have alluded to her resemblance to Kanako. I also would've liked a more fleshed-out birthday party scene.

On the other hand, non-otaku Saori was really cute, both in the past and in the present (it's easy to forget that she's still just a first-year in high school, since she's so tall and busty and always seems like the most mature of the group). It also now makes sense why she singled out Kirino and Kuroneko to make friends with. I'd been wondering for a while why she ditched all the other girls who showed up to hang out with these two, and now we see it's because she was shy herself, and appreciated how Kanata included her and made things fun for her. Saori knew the other girls would be okay, because they'd all hit it off with each other during the meeting, but she wanted to do her best to play Kanata's role for Kirino and Kuroneko and help them get involved with other people of the same interests. Kanata herself was also pretty fun to watch (her voice sounded Rie Kugimiya's). There were some implications that she was involved with the production of Maschera; in the past, we see her drawing the characters in her sketchbook, and she recognizes Kuroneko's costume right away. It's hard to believe that one family could produce the kindly and eccentric Kanata and the loathsome Kanako, though, and it seems like even if Kanako hated her sister, growing up with an otaku would make her somewhat more tolerant of them.

I kind of don't have high hopes for the next two episodes—in which Kirino's track rival Leah from the US comes to Japan, and Kyousuke pretends to be Kirino's boyfriend to give her an excuse for not wanting to go abroad to model—but although this episode had some clumsy flow, it at least had a lot of good material too. It was better than the second episode of this series, but not quite as good as the first episode due to the weird pacing, although it did have better material to work with. I'm sort of disappointed, because Ore Imo is one of my favorite shows (probably second to only Clannad and Bakemonogatari), and the sequel is so far not what I hoped it would be. I think maybe they've drifted too far from the novels.

** Thoughts on Episodes 4 and 5 of the second series, written June 12th, 2013:

While I should really be studying for my operating systems final tomorrow, I wanted to take some time to write about these two episodes, because they came as sort of a relief. Unfortunately, Episode 4 had to put me through hell first. It opens with Kyousuke walking in on a naked twelve-year-old coming out of his bathroom, followed by Kirino, whose towel proceeds to fall off and expose her naked body to Kyousuke. 

It was terrible.

The twelve-year-old is Ria (Leah in the first series translation), Kirino's roommate and so-called fastest elementary schooler in the world. She's a Kaolla Su-like character who jumps around, yells, is overly affectionate with Kyousuke, and calls him "Oniichan". She's come to visit Japan and is staying with Kirino and Kyousuke. She tells Kyousuke soon after meeting him that she wanted to meet him because she was curious to know what Kirino's beloved brother was like. When Kyousuke asks if she's disappointed, she says he's even better than she imagined and she wants him to be her oniichan too. Kirino of course blames him for everything and calls him a lolicon. By the time Ria tries to take a bath with him, I was thinking "God, this is terrible."

It made me sad to think it. The first Ore Imo and the novels are among my favorite series. But this was too terrible. It was too Love Hina. Ore Imo has always had a habit of falling back on the Love Hina idiom when inspiration failed it (one reason it can't match Clannad and Bakemonogatari), but this was too much. My plan at this point was to finish watching the episode, out of respect for what Ore Imo once was, and then give up on the second series forever.

Inexplicably, it got better.

For one thing, just after the bath scene, the Love Hina antics ended and we got a short montage focusing more on the sisterly relationship between Ria and Kirino. When Kirino asked if Ria could stay, she told her parents Ria was like a little sister to her. Only Kyousuke knew the true significance of this (that Kirino actually wants to bang her), but he observes that Kirino is a good neechan to Ria. 

After that, the two of them take Ria sightseeing in Akihabara. Ria doesn't really get anime and otaku culture, and she attacks the maid who called Kyousuke "Oniichan" while she's out attracting customers. All Ria loves is running. (That's why she's better than Kirino, who loves so many different things.) Kirino says she wanted to show Ria what she left America for. Ria then admits that she came to Japan just for a revenge race against Kirino; Kirino was expecting this too, and dressed for it. They go to a track (presumably at a school) and race. As Kyousuke watches, he observes that although he once believed Kirino was a genius, he now recognizes that she just worked harder than everyone else and the "genius" label was just an excuse for himself. But he also thinks that when you see Ria, you can discern that geniuses do exist, and that Kirino can't win. He decides to do his best to help her, and in his usual fashion, his help consists of yelling really embarrassing things. He starts out with just "Go Kirino! You can win! Do your best!", but eventually he ends up saying "I'm not a lolicon! I'm a siscon!"

Kirino loses anyway, but upon hearing Kyousuke cheer for her, she gets a burst of new speed and closes the gap, losing by just a tiny amount. After this, Ria goes home. She says she now knows that Kirino was able to win that one time because Kyousuke came to visit her. Kyousuke thinks that that's totally wrong and he'd like to tell her the real reason was eroge, but he can't, so he'll let Ria think it was him. (I don't know how wrong that idea actually is, though—Kirino did get faster when she heard him cheering for her.) After Ria goes, Kyousuke says it'll be a bit lonely without her and Kirino says he is a lolicon after all. When Kyousuke denies it, she says "Oh, right. You're a siscon." (We'd expect her to be more grossed out by this admission, or at least pretend to be, but she doesn't even bother to act like she's not happy, a sign of the growth of the relationship between her and Kyousuke.) Episode 4 ends with Kirino asking Kyousuke to be her boyfriend.

As far as I'm concerned, the most important aspect of Ore Imo is the relationship between Kirino and Kyousuke. Yes, I like the other characters, but they're peripheral. It's not really a meta-otaku show because the otaku aspects were just a way to bring Kyousuke and Kirino together over a shared secret. That relationship is the primary element of the show. That's what made this episode good—it focused on that primary element instead of diversions like wacky yandere hijinks or Saori's past (as much as I liked Saori's past). And that goodness continued in Episode 5. Kirino explains that a recruiter for a modeling agency wants to bring her to Europe and won't back off, but Kirino really can't go abroad again because her parents and friends would be angry. (Plus she doesn't really want to go. I'm sure Kirino's interest in nice clothes is genuine, but it seems like she works as a model mostly to fund her otaku habit; she doesn't seem to have the same passion for it that she does for track or little sisters.) To get the recruiter to back off, Kirino said she had a boyfriend. (What, family and friends aren't a good enough reason not to leave?) Since she doesn't actually, she asks Kyousuke to be her fake boyfriend. The recruiter offers Kyousuke 500,000 yen to break up with Kirino, which he is tempted by. Surprisingly, Kirino manages to resist the urge to slap him when he starts holding and cuddling her in a show of lovey-dovey affection to make the recruiter give up. When the recruiter asks if Kirino can work for her tomorrow, Kyousuke says they have a date.

Kirino is paranoid that the recruiter is following her, so she and Kyousuke actually go through with the date. They get all dressed up and walk around with arms linked, seemingly running into everyone they know along the way. (Except Ayase, thank god—she'd probably pull out her dozuki and gut both of them.) Kirino also starts calling Kyousuke by his first name instead of "anta". As they walk along arm-in arm, Kirino is looking a little embarrassed, but when they run into Manami, she suddenly perks up, grabs Kyousuke, and runs him off before he can say anything, beaming with happiness. She looks quite delighted when Kyousuke tells her that Manami definitely got the wrong idea. 

After a movie, they go to a restaurant and run into Kanako and Bridget-chan, who is inexplicably hanging out with Kanako. (Apparently they get paired up on jobs now.) Luckily, Kanako is a complete moron and doesn't remember Kyousuke. When Bridget-chan wants to know what they love about each other, Kanako also asks why Kirino is going out with such a plain guy. Kirino says he's reliable (sort of) and he (can be) dependable, and he seems to really care about her, obviously listing the things she really thinks about Kyousuke. Kyousuke then does the same and says that he loves how Kirino always does her best at everything. Kanako is suspicious, and points out that they don't seem like lovers somehow, but is too dumb to figure anything out. Last of all, they run into Kuroneko, who regards them with shock, especially when she hears Kirino refer to Kyousuke by his first name. Kirino decides not to bother with a lie and to just run away, since Kuroneko is someone they can explain the situation to later. (She'll just sigh as usual that Kyousuke is getting sucked into another one of his sister's insane plans.) 

After the date, Kirino complains about how boring it was and says to do better next time. (Next time?) She's also mad because she started trying to otaku out when they came out of the movie and Kyousuke told her to stop in that (as she puts it) scary voice. Kyousuke says she was a terrible date and he's never being her fake boyfriend again, and Kirino gets angry and slaps him, then does something far more terrible than slap him—she says "Next time I'll just have to ask my real boyfriend."

Kyousuke spends the next while obsessing over the possibility that Kirino has a boyfriend. He even asks Kuroneko about it on their way home from school. Kuroneko (once she lets him have it for being a sister-loving pervert who makes his sister walk arm-in-arm with him and call him by his first name) says Kirino doesn't, because if she did she would become obsessed with him, and Saori would be lonely. Kyousuke and Saori would be lonely, she amends, but as for Kuroneko herself, she would be happy. Like Kirino, Kuroneko has become a lot more honest with her feelings over the series, but she still has plenty of tsun-tsun in her. The writers played on that here during the long pause before Kuroneko says she would be happy. At first it sounds like Kuroneko is just being tsun-tsun towards Kirino, but then, with the last part, it turns around and we see that Kuroneko was actually being honest—presumably, she would be happy both because Kirino was happy and (mostly) because Kirino having someone else would free up Kyousuke to spend more time with her. 

That night, Kirino gets back late to find Kyousuke sitting on the stairs and waiting for her. He's very sober and serious as he asks her if she'll help out with Kuroneko's doujinshi and come sell it at Comiket. He apologizes for saying mean things before, and asks her straight out if she has a boyfriend. Kirino won't give him a straight answer and is very flippant about the whole thing.

Everyone goes to Comiket to sell Kuroneko's doujinshi. There's a really cute scene at the train station in front. Kirino and Kyousuke are fighting as usual, and wondering where Kuroneko is; Kuroneko sneaks up behind them and surprises them by suddenly revealing her presence. Rather than her usual black dress, she's wearing a cute white sundress and has her contacts out and nothing on her head. Kyousuke at first thinks she's cosplaying some other character, but when she says she's not, he compliments her on how well the outfit suits her. Kuroneko thanks Kirino for helping her choose it, and Kirino says it did end up looking really good. Kyousuke compliments Kirino's taste, and Kirino comments that she didn't realize Kuroneko was planning to wear it for Comiket. Kuroneko looks adorable in her outfit, and I really liked seeing the three of them together being nice and not fighting.

Kuroneko's book includes a manga by her, a short story by Kirino, and photos of Kyousuke's cosplay session as the main character of Maschera. The book sells out, which makes Kuroneko so happy she cries (last time she was left with 90% of her books); Kirino says she had a lot of fun working on the book with everyone, and wants to repeat the experience at Winter Comiket. The four of them (including Saori) go to the industry booths, where they run into some handsome guy who Kirino apparently knows, and the episode ends.

Not only was the date scene with Kirino and Kyousuke really adorable, we also got some advancement on the Kuroneko storyline and some cute scenes with Kuroneko, so this episode was pretty much the complete package (except for the missing Ayase disemboweling scene). I notice that Kirino's bitching about Kyousuke on occasions like the date is getting more and more muted, as if she's just going through the motions at this point. Kirino is still insecure about her relationship with him; despite all he's done for her, she still seems to want to hear that he enjoys spending time with her and doesn't do it just because she's family or to hit on Kuroneko and Ayase, and gets offended when he says he doesn't. But now that they do have a relationship, Kirino has a new way to strike at him; instead of bitching or hitting him, she can use psychological warfare. And Kyousuke being totally unprepared for this, it works beautifully; Kyousuke spends half an episode agonizing over whether Kirino has a boyfriend. 

Meanwhile, it seems like Kuroneko has decided to step it up and try harder to make Kyousuke notice her. That poor girl is even more abused than Manami. Kyousuke is probably her first love, and he really did do his best for her during the OVA, regardless of the actual effectiveness of what he did, but as soon as Kirino came back he sort of threw her away and went back to being Kirino's manservant. Kyousuke even knows that she likes him (he thought in Episode 1 of the second series that her kiss on the cheek was basically a confession), but he hasn't bothered to respond to it and Kuroneko has just given up being mad at him because she knows it won't do her any good. Her line that she would be happy if Kirino had a boyfriend, given the context, is pretty good evidence that she thinks Kyousuke would spend more time with her if Kirino were otherwise occupied, and that she feels ignored in favor of Kirino. Interestingly, this is the exact opposite of the situation I envisioned when I first heard about Kyousuke and Kuroneko's romance in later books; at the time I thought that Kyousuke would put all his attention into Kuroneko, and Kirino would have to fight to get back her time with her brother, but it turns out to be the opposite. I guess he really is a siscon after all.

It seems like Ore Imo II is starting to move out of its slump and get going on a real storyline, and I am extremely happy for that. It may never get to be as good as the first series, but after seeing that there is some life left in it after all, I'll probably watch it to the end.

(On a side note, during the start-up sequence of the FreeBSD operating system, a line about "syscons" is displayed on screen. I see horrible otaku-cross-programmer jokes here. Like "What do you call a systems administrator who falls in love with his server? A syscon!")

** Thoughts on Episode 6 of the second series, written Saturday, June 15th, 2013:

I wouldn't say this episode was up there with the very best of the first series, but it was still in the same league as some very good episodes from the first series, like Episodes 11 and 12. 

It turns out that the handsome guy Kirino runs into at Comiket is Mikagami, a delicate boy with a Little Lord Fauntleroy haircut who works as an accessory designer for the company that Misaki, the manager from the previous episode, runs. He's at Comiket selling his wares, because it turns out that he's an otaku as well, and he also likes magical girl stuff and was inspired to become a designer by a magical girl show. He and Kirino get along well, which irks Kyousuke a little.

Ayase calls Kyousuke over to her house to talk to him. Kyousuke imagines that she's saying everything cutely as she asks him on the phone, and runs over there, only to have her put handcuffs on him so she's safe from him. She shows him the Print Club photo that he took with Kirino in Episode 5 and demands to know what's going on, getting her creepy Higurashi yandere eyes and threatening to kill him. When Kyousuke shrinks back against the wall, she somehow gets offended and says it makes her feel bad when he acts so scared (does she have no idea how frightening and psychotic she is?!). Kyousuke explains what happened; Ayase believes him, but says it's strange because Misaki was at a show that day and couldn't have been following them around. (She knows! Kirino lied so Kyousuke would bring her on the date!) Kyousuke asks if Kirino has a boyfriend, and Ayase says not as far as she knows, though Kirino gets hit on all the time by models, producers, and other high-powered famous people. 

While walking to Kyousuke's house together, Kyousuke and Kuroneko are talking about the situation with Mikagami. I don't remember how but right outside his gate, Kyousuke asks Kuroneko if she likes him. She once again gives him the answer that she likes him as much as his sister does. Kyousuke says he might get the wrong idea, Kuroneko says it's okay if he gets the wrong idea. Just as Kyousuke is about to ask her about the kiss, Kirino opens the door and says irately for them to come inside

The intention was to have a Comiket after party, but everything is all awkward now because Kirino knows exactly what she interrupted at the front gate, and Kuroneko and Kyousuke know that she knows. Just before the party is about to begin, Kirino announces that she and Mikagami are going out, and have even kissed. Kuroneko leaves in tears, and Kyousuke gets angry. He and Kirino shout at each other, and when Kirino asks (rhetorically) why she can't have a boyfriend when Kyousuke is always flirting with Manami and Kuroneko, Kyousuke says she should just do whatever she wants and Kirino leaves the room. Saori puts away all the food and says she can't smooth things over between Kirino and Kuroneko this time and it's going to be up to him. Kyousuke says he might fail, so Saori takes off her swirly glasses and takes her hair down and speaks in her cute voice, telling him to believe in himself.

Kirino brings over Mikagami for a visit. Their mother swoons over him, but Kyousuke comes in and starts copping an attitude, kicking Mikagami out of his seat and sulking. Kirino slaps him and yells at him to get out. Kyousuke goes to his parents' room, where their father is drunk and insisting that he'll never let Kirino have a boyfriend. Kyousuke incongruously finds himself defending Mikagami, saying that Mikagami seems like a nice guy and he and Kirino have a lot in common. (Mikagami does seem like a good guy; it was just his bad luck to get caught up in Kirino's childish ploy and have to face the anger of Kyousuke and their father.) Their father insists that he's going to go punch Mikagami, and Kyousuke says he'll do it instead.

The next thing we see is Kyousuke groveling on the floor in front of Mikagami and Kirino, begging their forgiveness. He apologizes for how he acted before, and says that he takes back what he said about Kirino doing whatever she wants and admits that the idea of her with a boyfriend bothers him. He says he could possibly approve of a boyfriend, but only if he could be sure it was someone who would cherish Kirino as much as he does. Mikagami and Kirino then reveal that it was all fake; Kirino asked Mikagami to be her fake boyfriend so she could hear Kyousuke's true feelings. Mikagami says he can't be Kirino's boyfriend, and leaves. 

The next day, Kyousuke goes to meet Kuroneko behind the school. He tells her that Kirino wants to redo the party the next day, and Kuroneko says she knows, because they spoke on the phone last night. They've apparently made up. Kuroneko then comes right out and asks Kyousuke to go out with her.

At this point it seems like Kirino is "adjusting" her relationship with Kyousuke. She's always been the one taking active steps to change their relationship, including the event that started the series, and it seems like she now has most of what she wants, but she still wants to be clear on a few things, like how Kyousuke should feel about going on a date with her. I still think that she doesn't have romantic intent towards him, and that feeling is strengthened by what I have to say below. But she does want to date him, in the sense of periodically going out and spending time together doing something fun. When she reveals that Mikagami isn't her boyfriend, she rattles off a bunch of reasons why she went this far, in her usual way, and one of them is that she felt Kyousuke looked disgusted about being her fake boyfriend, presumably when he said he was never doing it again. Of course, if he doesn't have fun on their dates, he won't want to keep doing them, and she was afraid of that; plus, she keeps having to lie or make up excuses to get him on a date with her, which probably makes her feel insecure about their future dating prospects. Anyway, this confession was so cute that it overrode the unpleasant fact that she sabotaged poor Kuroneko for her own reasons. (In my mind. But I'm a Kirino fan.)

Since I am terrible, I looked ahead to the synopsis of the next episode on Crunchyroll, and it says that Kirino gives her approval for Kyousuke to date Kuroneko. So I think that Kirino probably called up Kuroneko, apologized for sabotaging them at the front gate, explained what was going on, and said she was okay with them being together now that she'd done what she needed to. Which is mean, but Kuroneko probably understood, because she knows how Kirino has struggled for and fantasized about a certain type of relationship with Kyousuke. It makes sense that Kirino would approve of those two together, as well, because Kuroneko is her friend, unlike Manami, and brings Kyousuke closer to her, unlike Manami who brings him apart into her own family. In fact, Kuroneko has already brought the two of them closer together (though even more so in the novel, with the alternate version of the novel-writing subplot), so Kirino should actually feel grateful to her. But at any rate, poor Kuroneko was the victim of bad timing; she happened to be trying to ask Kyousuke out right in the middle of Kirino's Machiavellian scheme to make him jealous, and she became a casualty.

Someone on the comments was complaining that they don't want Kyousuke to end up with Kirino. Since I'm a Kirino fan and a siscon, I wouldn't mind that, but I do think that Kyousuke and Kuroneko are a really good couple and that there's been something between them since early on—probably the shared experience of being older siblings. When I read that they ended up going out after I'd seen about  two-thirds of the first series, I thought it would be terrible, because they didn't seem to go together at all, but the writers did a really good job leading into it, especially in Episode 7, Episode 9, Episode 11, and the OVA, so at this point I'm actually happy to see it. (The novels also did a lot of good relationship-building between those two, with the novel subplot and the extra material in what became Episode 11.) I'm looking forward to seeing them go out. There's also an Ayase episode later on, which should be good. I enjoyed her appearance in this episode. It's odd how Kyousuke's way of acting towards her has totally changed; he used to be purely afraid of her and try to avoid her, but now he seems eager to talk to her and always acts like she's hitting on him. This is more like how he was in the novels; he told us in the novels that he had a crush on Ayase and that his ideal girl would be Ayase's looks with Manami's personality, and in the novel version of Episode 10, we heard that he immediately went running when Ayase contacted him. But maybe in the anime, he just decided it was useless being afraid of Ayase or trying to be polite to her, because her image of him is already carved in stone, so he might as well live up to that image and be a pervert (insofar as he can do it without finding a pizza cutter lodged in his skull). 

** Thoughts on Episodes 7 and 8 of Series II, written Tuesday, June 18th, 2013:

Poor Kuroneko. She really gets put through the wringer in these two episodes, and it's mostly because she's a good person. I got the sense watching these episodes that Kuroneko has never had friends as good as Kyousuke and Kirino (and Saori, of course, but she's not the main issue), and she's been trying her best all this time to do something nice for them. These episodes also shed a little light on her "Belphegor..." reaction to Manami that I mentioned above.

Episode 7 picks up from the back of the school, where Kuroneko has just asked Kyousuke to go out with her. When Kyousuke waffles, poor Kuroneko tries to bribe him, saying that she can make lunch for him every day and she's a pretty good cook (as we know from Episode 9 of Series I), and she can make him cosplay costumes now that he's developed a weird attachment to cosplaying. Kyousuke asks for one day to think about it. 

He goes home and sees Kirino sitting on the couch. Kirino tells Kyousuke that he has to do something for her in return for all the annoyance he put her through with the fake boyfriend incident. Kyousuke braces, but all she says is that if a girl he cherishes asks him out, please consider her request very carefully. Kyousuke also receives permission from Manami to go out with Kuroneko (which is weird, because Manami likes him. Maybe she's just spineless, or maybe she just figures his relationship with Kuroneko will fall apart and he'll end up back with her in the end. Scheming, Manami...or should I say Belphegor?!) 

The otaku group has the Comiket after-party, during which Kyousuke reveals that he stuck one of the purikura stickers of his picture with Kirino on his cell phone, and made his wallpaper a picture of Kirino in a bathing suit, per his new role as a raging siscon. After the party, while walking Kuroneko home, Kyousuke agrees to go out with her.

Both Kyousuke and Kuroneko spend the night being all giddy and wondering what they should do  now that they have a boyfriend/girlfriend. The next day, Mikagami ambushes Kyousuke outside the house and says he wants to find someone to talk about otaku stuff with, asking if Kyousuke will introduce him to the game development club. Kyousuke agrees, and on the way he asks Mikagami (for some reason) when it's okay to touch your girlfriend's breasts. Mikagami thinks he's talking about Kirino (what else would he think after what happened?) Kyousuke brings him over to the game development club, where Sena thinks he's Kyousuke's new boyfriend and is excited to have another handsome boy to have yaoi fantasies about. When Kuroneko shows up, she and Kyousuke debate in whisper about whether to tell the others about their relationship, but it turns out that everyone in the club thought they were going out this whole time and is confused to hear that they only just started. Mikagami supports their story by mentioning that Kyousuke asked him just this morning when it's okay to grab your girlfriend's breasts.

The other members take Mikagami off to show him around, leaving Kyousuke and Kuroneko alone. Kuroneko says she's not really mad about the breast-touching thing, because she feels the same way about him, to which Kyousuke responds "You want to touch my breasts?" They jokingly argue about who spent more time thinking about the other (both of them were up all night), but Kuroneko wins when she shows Kyousuke her notebook, which she filled with drawings and writings about all the things she'd like to do with him. Kyousuke says he's glad she made it, because now he can just ask her to find out what she wants to do and he doesn't have to try and guess. (I loved how this whole "problem" was dispatched in one scene instead of having a lame episode where Kyousuke and Kuroneko keep misunderstanding each other before discovering that, hey, they can just talk!)

In Episode 8, Kyousuke and Kuroneko go out on their first date. Kuroneko makes herself a new outfit, a white angelic outfit, during a rant about dying and being reborn as an angelic being still trapped in darkness that her sisters observe with confusion. She even wears wings; the middle Gokou sister, Hinata, tries to convince her to leave the wings behind, pointing out that they won't even fit through the door, so Kuroneko puts on her smaller backup pair. She tells Kyousuke that she made it because he said she looks good in white (back in Episode 5). Kyousuke says it makes her look more sexy, and when she asks how (for future reference), he says her chest seems larger. (Also, she won't answer when he calls her Kuroneko, and insists that her new name is "Kamineko".)

Kyousuke and Kuroneko go out to all of Kuroneko's favorite places; Kuroneko asks him afterward if it was boring, but Kyousuke says he enjoyed learning more about her and he'd like to learn even more. Kuroneko crosses out "Teach Senpai more about me" in her notebook. She also shows Kyousuke her ultimate goal, represented as a drawing of him and Kirino sitting at their kitchen table, both smiling and happy. Kyousuke says he'll do whatever he can to help her achieve that goal.  Kuroneko moves on to the next item, "Invite Senpai to my house". Her sisters are both out. Kuroneko puts on an episode of Maschera containing an intense love scene between the character that she always cosplays and the character Kyousuke always cosplays, and right in the middle, hits pause and runs off. Kyousuke discovers that she's in the shower and nervously begins to fantasize about what she means by taking a shower while he's waiting in the living room. Her sisters return; Hinata is shocked to discover that Kyousuke exists and isn't a figment of Kuroneko's imagination or a 2D character. She asks if Kyousuke is the brother of that bitch that Kuroneko is always arguing with on the phone and asks if she can call him "Bitch-oniisan". Kyousuke objects to that. The youngest sister, Tamaki, decides to call him "oniichan", and Hinata settles on "Kousaka-kun". Kuroneko reenters the room and is surprised to find her sisters there. Hinata taunts her, asking why she was in the bath while her boyfriend was waiting in the living room, and Kuroneko drags her off to torment her. (By the way, Hinata is also played by Kana Hanazawa, using a voice just a bit more Nadeko-like, and is really cute. I loved that side story where she complains that Tamaki wrote all about loving Kuroneko and only mentioned her in passing.)

A bit later, Kirino comes home to find Kuroneko's shoes at the doorstep. Deciding not to disturb them, she goes to her room to play eroge, but then hears them in Kyousuke's room talking in an apparently erotic manner and bursts in, only to find them on Kyousuke's bed, fully clothed and playing a game. Kuroneko correctly guesses that Kirino thought they were doing something erotic; Kyousuke says if Kirino was home, she should have come in, but Kirino says she's not insensitive and didn't want to disturb them. Kuroneko says she would never go out with Kyousuke if it meant excluding Kirino and asks Kirino what she is to her; Kirino, adorably, manages to get out "friend", but she refuses Kuroneko's invitation to come try out the game, saying maybe another time. Kuroneko is clearly bothered by this incident.

Kyousuke takes Kuroneko out to a summer festival, complimenting her yukata and saying she looks like Kaguya-hime. They enjoy themselves and go to watch the fireworks, but as the fireworks are ending, Kuroneko shows Kyousuke the last item in her notebook--"Break up with Senpai".

I kind of wish they would've decompressed the events of these two episodes a little, but otherwise they were excellent, amazingly good episodes. I loved seeing more of the adorable sides of both Kirino and Kuroneko. I really felt sorry for Kuroneko. I don't doubt that she likes Kyousuke, but I'm sure she also thought that going out with Kyousuke would further her ultimate goal of bringing Kyousuke and Kirino closer together; as I've mentioned before, it does seem like going out with Kirino's good friend would bring him closer to Kirino, especially since the three of them can spend time together doing otaku stuff, but the incident at the house when Kirino wanted to stay out of the way showed Kuroneko that things weren't working out the way she wanted and Kirino was now uncomfortable spending time with them. Since it seemed to actually be hindering her ultimate goal, Kuroneko decided the best thing was to break up with Kyousuke, even though it must have hurt her personally to do it.

I can kind of see why Kuroneko decided to go so far for the two of them. My guess is that she's never had a lot of friends; I doubt she became like she was at the beginning of the OVA overnight. She tends to be proud and unapproachable, only considering certain people good enough to be her friends, and having a hard time approaching anyone herself. I'm sure that at first, Kirino was just an obnoxious woman who always dumped on Maschera, but at the same time, I bet Kuroneko was lonely for otaku companionship, just like Kirino was, and stuck with her because of that. Not only did the two of them become closer, but a friendship started to develop between Kuroneko and Kyousuke, who was much easier to get along with, and who Kuroneko seemed to admire and sympathize with because of the lengths he went to for his sister, which she understood as an older sister herself. So she probably feels really close to both of them, especially after the time she and Kyousuke spent together while Kirino was abroad. I've also postulated (and seem to have been proven correct) that Kirino told Kuroneko things about the relationship she wanted with Kyousuke that she possibly didn't even tell Ayase; this probably brought Kirino and Kuroneko closer together and also made Kuroneko (who also knew things about Kyousuke's feelings that Kirino didn't know) want to help the people she felt so close to by bringing them together.

But I do think that Kuroneko actually fell in love with Kyousuke during the OVA. We saw how giddy she was to become his girlfriend in Episodes 6 and 7. So of course she was bothered when Kirino interrupted the two of them at the gate in Episode 6 of Series II, but when Kirino pulled the fake boyfriend card, Kuroneko ran out of the room crying instead of raging probably because she was sad that Kirino and Kyousuke were fighting again, contrary to her goal of bringing them closer  together. That could be why she wasn't mad at Kirino for longer after Kirino explained to her what was going on: because Kirino was also, in her way, trying to get closer to Kyousuke, which also furthered Kuroneko's goal, even if it shuttered Kuroneko's own plans for doing so. Still, I think Kuroneko's plan to accomplish the goal—to intertwine the three of them with more official relationships, bringing them all closer together—was more positive and kinder than Kirino's way of doing things.

I think Kuroneko jumped the gun a bit, though, by breaking up with Kyousuke so soon. Kirino may have just needed a little time to get used to the new way things were; given that time, it's entirely possible the three of them would have ended up being even closer, just as Kuroneko wished. But there was also a risk that if Kirino couldn't adjust and things went on too long, their relationships would all be too damaged to recover. So Kuroneko was probably trying to back out before it was too late to repair things. That's why I felt so sorry for poor Kuroneko in these episodes. Unlike Kirino's plans to get closer to Kyousuke, which are usually somewhat crude and manipulative (much like many of Kyousuke's plans to convince people to do things), Kuroneko's plan was gentle, positive, and intended to benefit everyone; Kuroneko gets a boyfriend and a closer friend; Kirino gets a closer friend and a closer brother; and Kyousuke gets a girlfriend and a closer sister. But now that Kuroneko's dropped the shield of her pride, she's vulnerable, and she's afraid of losing everything, so she's risk-averse. That's why she decided to back out of her plan and try to reset everything. Maybe she decided to give up on her goal and let the two of them work it out themselves, or maybe she just decided that her methods were too extreme and she should try some less extreme ones.

I've really, really enjoyed these past few episodes, and it makes me glad I stuck with the series through the mediocre stuff at the beginning. The feeling is a bit different, but it's still the same characters I loved, and I'm glad to see them growing and changing instead of remaining static. I'm glad to see Kirino has come to the point where she can tend to Kyousuke's wounds like she did at the beginning of Episode 8. I'm glad to see her and Kuroneko publicly admit to being friends. And I'm glad to see Kyousuke stop claiming to hate Kirino and admit that he loves her, even if he seems to have gone a little bananas. I'd also really like to see the series end with Kuroneko's goal coming to pass, and the three of them as a tight-knit group, just as that little scene outside Comiket in Episode 5 hinted at.

** Thoughts on Episode 9 of Series II, written Wednesday, June 19th, 2013:

This episode wraps up the Kuroneko-dating storyline, and while it felt a little too neat and clean, and made me once again feel sorry for poor Kuroneko, it was also an episode filled with adorableness and adorablosity.

But I want to complain about the title. They just reused the series title again. That was already the title of Episode 3. I cut them a little slack because the recent storyline hasn't been very episodic, so it's probably hard to come up with names for the individual episodes, but several ideas came to me for this episode, like "My Kouhai Can't Transfer Away like this!" or "My Little Sister Can't Track Down my Girlfriend like this!" or "We Can't Keep Reusing the Series Title like this!"

Anyway, Kyousuke tries to contact Kuroneko after the summer festival, asking if the "Break up with Senpai" thing in her notebook was a joke, but she never responds. He tries asking Sena, and she tells him that Kuroneko is transferring schools. Kyousuke goes to her house, but it's empty and the nameplate is gone. Distraught and unable to sleep, he remembers Manami offering her help if he ever needs it, but decides that she's the wrong person for this and instead goes to Kirino. Recapitulating Kirino's actions from the first episode, Kyousuke slaps her awake in the middle of a dream about Miyabi-chan (we saw her replaying Sis x Sis in Episode 8, when she heard Kuroneko and Kyousuke in the other room).

Kirino hears Kyousuke out and asks him what he wants to do. Kyousuke says he doesn't know, which is why he came to her for advice, and then actually cries; although he tries (sort of) to hide it, Kirino sees and starts to feel awkward. She asks him to turn around, puts him in a sleeper hold, then embraces him and pets his head adorably, saying their mother used to do that for her whenever she lost a race and was feeling down. She says she'll help him track down Kuroneko so they can ask why she did such a thing.

Kuroneko apparently left a map somewhere showing where she was, so Kirino uses it and tracks her to a hot springs town in the north. Kyousuke despairs of finding her, but Kirino says that she stands out, so someone might have seen her. They go around showing her picture and asking if anyone has seen her, without success. As they take a break, relaxing with their feet in a hot spring and talking about getting lunch somewhere, Kuroneko happens to see them from behind and is so shocked she calls out to them. Kirino swoops on her and grabs her by the wrist so she can't escape, demanding that she explain herself.

Kuroneko says that she'll explain herself, but first Kirino has to explain her own true feelings when she saw Kyousuke with a girlfriend. Kirino first yells that she hates her brother (I assume she's being tsun-tsun, because no one believes that at this point), but then says that she wanted to be the most important person to him. She couldn't bear seeing him flirting with other women because she wanted to be the most important to him, and it hurt when she saw him with Kuroneko (as Kuroneko already knew and points out). But Kirino still told Kuroneko it was okay to confess to him when Kuroneko called to ask permission, because she knew how much Kuroneko liked him and didn't want to get in their way. Kuroneko, though, saw the pained expression on Kirino's face that day when she wouldn't come play with them and decided to break up with him. She tells Kirino that she has an ultimate plan that will come to pass only with the completion of all the ceremonies in the Destiny Records (her notebook) and her reason for breaking up with Kyousuke was to bring that plan to pass. She then asks Kirino why, since Kirino was pained so much by seeing them together, she came out with Kyousuke to find Kuroneko. Kirino says even though it pained her to see Kyousuke with a girlfriend, she was even more pained to see him crying. She talks about how she thought he hated her, yet he always came to her rescue whenever she needed help, and she felt like she wanted to do the same here.

Kuroneko confronts Kyousuke and tells him he must choose between her and Kirino. Kyousuke panics, knowing this is a choice with no good end, but Kuroneko suddenly says she was joking, starts coughing, and turns a horrible shade of grey. With great drama, she passes out in the street as Kyousuke and Kirino struggle to keep her alive.

Later, Kyousuke and Kirino are at Kuroneko's new apartment. It turned out she was just in the hot springs town on vacation with her family and her new home was still not very far from the Kousaka house, although she did change schools. They talk about the logical paradox they've now created with their desire not to give up their siblings; Kyousuke says he'll probably get a girlfriend when Kirino gets a boyfriend, but Kirino can't get a boyfriend because Kyousuke doesn't want her to, and Kyousuke can't get a girlfriend because Kirino doesn't want him to. Kuroneko appears and serves them tea in a cat-eared maid outfit, prompting Kirino to call her "Ero-neko" and accuse her of trying to seduce Kyousuke. She shows them another drawing she made of herself, Kirino, and Kyousuke all sitting around enjoying themselves at her table and tells them it depicts her end goal after all the ceremonies in the Destiny Record. Kirino says that's totally implausible and Kyousuke agrees that he can't see them all getting along that well, but when Kuroneko says she has a long road ahead of her, Kyousuke thinks that it probably isn't as long as she thinks.

This episode was just totally adorable, especially the scene at the beginning when Kirino petted Kyousuke on the head. That may have been even cuter than Episode 11 of Series I. Although I had already guessed many of the true feelings which are revealed in this episode, I still liked seeing them get out there so that everyone knows where everyone else stands, even if it led to a strange and not totally satisfactory situation for Kyousuke, Kirino, and Kuroneko. It was also really cute when Kirino finally admitted that she's wanted Kyousuke to love her all this time and she really was jealous of the other girls in his life. I'm not sure if Kyousuke will connect the dots, but now he knows everything he needs to explain her behaviour towards Manami all this time. 

Once again, poor Kuroneko was the big loser. Although she did manage to maintain her friendship with both Kousaka siblings, she's back to square one in some ways, though her ultimate goal is closer than ever now that she's gotten them to admit their feelings about one another. I'm not sure what she was playing at when she asked Kyousuke to choose between her and Kirino. Doing something like that would just make all three of them miserable. Whatever she thought she was doing, she seems to have decided it was a bad idea and faked her own "death" to get out of it.

I thought it was a nice touch how, in this episode, Kirino and Kuroneko both refer to Kyousuke as "Kyousuke" (and sometimes "aniki" in Kirino's case) and to each other as "Kirino" and "Kuroneko", instead of calling Kyousuke "anta" and each other "that woman" as in previous episodes. It was another sign of how they really are growing closer, and Kuroneko's goal is coming to pass as she continues fulfilling the ceremonies written in the Destiny Records.

The next episode involves Ayase, which ought to be good.

** Thoughts on Episodes 10 and 11 of Series II, written Saturday, June 22nd, 2013:

With Episodes 10 and 11, the series backslides a bit into the mediocrity of the earlier episodes. It sort of seems like the story is limping into an Ayase storyline, though I don't guess there's enough time to finish it up in the last episode, so they're probably planning another OVA or something.

Episode 10 begins with a few miscellaneous scenes showing how Ayase reacted when she heard that Kyousuke had a girlfriend—badly, though she claims that she was just worried about how she would get advice on continuing her lesbian relationship with Kirino if she couldn't ask him. After hearing that Kyousuke and Kuroneko have broken up, she calls him and apologizes, believing it's her fault that they broke up. Kyousuke assures her that isn't the case, and Ayase ropes him into being Kanako's manager at Meru-Fest, though he leaves soon after to get Kirino. (We see that Bridget-chan is terrified of Ayase, following an accidental incident where she witnessed Kanako being "punished".)

Kyousuke borrows a bicycle with naked Meruru on the tires from Mikagami and rides off to Kirino's modeling shoot to pick her up; he's attacked by security personnel until Kirino admits that he's her brother and is allowed to leave with him. At least the last ten minutes of the episode was Kirino feeling awkward around Kyousuke and looking longingly at him; they miss Kanako's concert, but arrive in time to see ClariS. (According to Wikipedia, ClariS has never appeared in public and the true identities of its two members, Clara and Alice, along with their real names, remain shrouded in mystery. Maybe they gave a concert by having a mysterious dark man deliver a computer to the stage connected to a studio in which they were performing, the way L would make announcements to the world police community in Death Note.)

It wasn't that I hated this episode—it did have some pretty cute scenes, and we got to see more of Ayase, and got to see Kirino in a wedding dress, which, combined with Kyousuke's suit for his fake manager job, made it look like they were riding home from their wedding on a bicycle with naked Meruru on the tires—but it felt pretty pointless. I assume the first half was just meant to remind us of the romantic subtext that existed between Kyousuke and Ayase early on, by showing us Ayase's otherwise irrational opposition to Kyousuke having a girlfriend and her own longing looks at him during the concert prep. But I remembered it just fine, and anyway, Episode 11 had enough similar material to remind anyone who'd forgotten.

Episode 11 opens with Kyousuke and Kirino's mother, Yoshino, accusing Kyousuke of doing something erotic with Kirino. As evidence she advances Kirino's sudden switch from calling Kyousuke "anta" or saying "ne" to get his attention to calling him by his first name with no honorific, as well as the print club sticker she found on the refrigerator. (It's not like they're kissing in that picture; it's really not that suggestive, so I don't know why Yoshino takes it that way. At least Ayase had prior evidence to make her take it that way.) Their father doesn't believe this, but he still finds it a good excuse to make Kyousuke move out until Kyousuke can get a top score on his college entrance exams. 

I don't know how Kyousuke is supposed to get any studying done, though, because every girl he knows pays him a visit during this episode. Kirino buys Kyousuke a refrigerator for his new room and gives him an eroge to relieve stress when he takes breaks. She shrugs off his grand declarations that he'll be back home soon by pretending she doesn't care, though pretty much everyone knows what a lie that is now. Then, unexpectedly, Kanako calls, continuing the writers' attempt to rehabilitate Kanako. She ends up coming over for some reason and giving Kyousuke food. Kanako reveals that she doesn't get along with her parents and lives with her sister (Kanata, Saori's old friend and otaku role model, we may assume), but she's learning to cook to try and make peace with them somehow. (Nothing in this episode seems to make a whole lot of sense.) She also reveals that she figured out Kyousuke and Kirino were brother and sister (though she really was too dumb to recognize him when he was pretending to be Kirino's boyfriend; Bridget-chan pointed out that the manager and the boyfriend were the same person) and that Kirino is an otaku, though she then pretends that it's impossible to believe. (At least, that's what Kyousuke thinks; we know she's not very smart, so maybe that's not an act.) He also has to deal with Kanako discovering the eroge under his bed, though he does so in a very uncharacteristic manner; instead of freaking out and losing his mind, he just asserts, in an emotionless voice, that it's not an eroge and that the picture on the back depicts the girl eating a (pixellated) sausage.

Kyousuke spends a night looking at pictures of Ayase on the Internet (he has her down as "My Lovely Angel Ayase-tan" on his cell phone and looks her up under that name on the Internet) and falls asleep.
[continued Sunday, June 23rd]
He's awoken the next morning by Ayase letting herself in. She pulls out a sheathed kitchen knife, and Kyousuke is convinced she's going to kill him, but she tells him it's a housewarming gift. She found out he's living on his own from Manami, but won't tell him how she got the key (probably from Kirino, although Kyousuke is convinced there's a black market that sold it to her). There's a housewarming party planned for Kyousuke, and Ayase invited both Manami and Kirino; when Kyousuke tells her that Kirino doesn't like Manami, Ayase says she wants to change that. (So she didn't know about Kirino and Manami.)

Kuroneko appears at the door in her new uniform, a navy blue sailor fuku. She and Ayase immediately get into an argument about who is better friends with Kirino; Ayase insists that it was wrong of Kuroneko to go out with Kyousuke against Kirino's wishes, but Kuroneko says she wouldn't care even if Kyousuke and Kirino had sex, making her a better friend to Kirino. Kuroneko comes in and she and Ayase fight for a while, with Ayase declaring that she just doesn't like Kuroneko for some reason. (That  reason probably being her own feelings for Kyousuke that have been appearing in recent episodes.) Kuroneko made lunch for Kyousuke, but she is concerned (or pretends to be so, more like) that Kyousuke and Ayase are planning to eat it together in a little love nest.  Ayase leaves and Kyousuke tells Kuroneko that he can't date her again until everything is cleared up with Kirino; Kuroneko says she's okay with that and will wait.

Other than the rehabilitation of Kanako, I didn't mind the majority of this episode, and I did enjoy the first meeting of Ayase and Kuroneko (two of my top three favorite characters), but the initial setup for Kyousuke moving out was totally nonsensical. I think I would've liked it better if Yoshino and Daisuke had just said something like Kyosuke's new-found lovey-dovey relationship with Kirino was interfering with his studies, and made him move out to concentrate on getting a high grade. We still could've had all the fun parts of the scene where Kirino is embarrassed, but without the nonsensical parts. 

I also watched the five minute preview of the final episode, which begins with Saori, Kuroneko, and Manami all in Kyousuke's room planning for the party. Kuroneko is actually being friendly to Manami, which I liked to see; I suppose at this point, Kuroneko doesn't have to worry about Manami being a wrench in her machinations because Kyousuke already said he wouldn't date anyone until Kirino was okay with it. I read ahead a bit in the novels, so I know that Kirino ends up making peace with Manami too, but I'm eager to see it since I think it'll be a really adorable moment for Kirino. (Though her jealousy of Manami was consistently adorable.)

Someone really got to work translating the novels, because they are pretty much all done now. This series covered most of the material in the novels up to the end, but there is a book that includes side stories from various characters' perspectives. I mentioned it above as containing the story from Hinata Gokou's perspective (which ended adorably, by the way, with Hinata achieving her dream of meeting Kirino, both because Kirino was glamorous and beautiful and Hinata admired that, and because Hinata was happy that her lonely older sister Ruri-nee found a real live friend). It also has a story from Kirino's perspective about what happened when she and Kyousuke stayed at the inn with the Gokou family for a night and went into the bath with Kuroneko, Hinata, and Tamaki. (She was already going into siscon mode over Hinata and Tamaki, so imagine what horrors await them in the bath—I'm thinking something like what Sena Kashiwazaki did to Kobato Hasegawa in Episode 10 of Haganai.)

** On Episode 12, July 18th, 2013:

Episode 12 was very bizarre. Ever since Episode 4 or so, Ore Imo has had two personalities: it's usually a very fun series with good, organic, character-based humor that also does well with its emotional undercurrent of rebuilding the relationship between Kyousuke and Kirino (or building up the relationship between Kyousuke and Kuroneko). Then sometimes it becomes demented and tosses in stupid Love Hina-like scenes, or boring contrived drama, plows straight through that, and goes back to normal the next scene or episode. The novels were somewhat better about this, but far from innocent—for example, that terrible scene where Kirino falls on Kyousuke while they're fighting so that his hand is on her breast and her skirt is pushed up was in the novel. I almost bought it in the novel, since they described how it happened in a way that sounded semi-plausible, but it was still a terrible, lazy scene that had no purpose except to move the narrative ahead, in the worst way possible, to the next scene.

Episode 12 pushed both sides of Ore Imo's personality to the absolute maximum. We begin with Kyousuke's housewarming party; Kirino and Manami declare a temporary truce, until such time as their battle may continue, and Kirino tells Ayase she isn't angry with her for arranging for Manami to be there. Kanako shows up in the middle of the party and starts claiming to be Kyousuke's lover; she, Kuroneko, and Manami start an argument about who will be Kyousuke's wife while he's living alone. Kyousuke asks Saori to intercede, but Saori (in her fashionable outfit, without her glasses) decides that she's going to take care of him, using her skills and money. Kirino gets angry and yells at all of them, saying they'll just distract him when he needs to focus. She then turns to the one person she (thinks she) can trust—Ayase, who "reluctantly" agrees to be Kyousuke's wife, "for Kirino's sake".

For the next while, Ayase cooks and cleans for Kyousuke, suffers his sexual harassment, and waves a knife at him when he goes too far. Later, when it rains and she gets wet coming over, she borrows his shower, and not only doesn't lock the door but actually leaves it ajar, tempting Kyousuke to peep. He doesn't get to finish, though, because Hinata is at the door, having been dispatched by Kuroneko to check on him as a neutral third-party. (Hinata is also voiced by Kana Hanazawa, with more of a Nadeko twist, and is also really adorable—I actually find her cuter than Tamaki, especially after that short story from the novels.) 

The episode ends with Kyousuke passing his test and moving out. Ayase comes to help him and to say goodbye. In an adorable and surprising scene, she confesses that she has a thing for him, and has had ever since she first saw him. She knew he was lying the whole time just to get her and Kirino back together, which only made her love him more, and she accuses him of constantly being dishonest about his feelings and says she feels bad for things like putting handcuffs on him. When Ayase confesses her love, Kyousuke grows serious and says he loves someone else (Kuroneko?). Ayase commands him to love her and says she'll kill him if he doesn't, while crying, but Kyousuke stands firm. Ayase then says that every time they interact, it always ends the same way—with her kicking him in the head—and asks for the favor of ending her period as his wife how she wants. Kyousuke stands firm for the biggest kick in the head he's ever felt as Ayase charges at him, but at the last minute she pulls back and kisses him on the cheek.

So this episode was really bizarre. The first part was semi-retarded; the characters seemed like Love Hina-fied substitutions for their usual selves (except Saori and Kanako, who were totally unlike their usual selves). I was glad to see that Kirino, at least, kept her head and screamed at them all for acting like retarded 90s harem show characters. After that it went back to normal and headed into the very sweet conclusion where Ayase confesses her love. 

Although I really like Ayase and found her confession scene very cute, she deserves what she got with regards to Kyousuke; even though she liked him from the beginning and knew none of the things he said were true, she kept going with the pretense that he was a horrible pervert and waited for another girl to confess to him. Maybe she knew Kirino's feelings on the matter of Kyousuke getting a girlfriend, but the fact that she didn't know about Kirino's antipathy towards Manami, while Kuroneko did, suggests that Kirino told Kuroneko a lot more about her and Kyousuke than she told to Ayase. In fact, it seems like Kirino didn't even know that Ayase had a thing for Kyousuke since she asked Ayase to be Kyousuke's wife, citing Ayase's hatred of Kyousuke as the reason she knew she could trust her. In any case, Kyousuke and Kuroneko seemed really happy together, so I can see why he'd want to go back to her once Kirino is okay with it; though he's been attracted to Ayase since meeting her, she's not only a bit young for him, the way she handled things shows that she's immature, despite her seeming maturity. Kuroneko is sweet, obviously loves Kyousuke, and seems easygoing and willing to forgive his faults (which is not something I ever would've expected based on how she usually acts, but that is how she behaved when they were going out). She would even be okay if he had sex with Kirino—women who are okay with you having sex with another woman are uncommon, and that goes double if the other woman is your sister, so he'd be crazy to pass her up, even for a beauty like Ayase. (Also, Kuroneko will never carve his eyeballs out with a kitchen knife.) I did feel a little sorry for Ayase, but she actually took it pretty well, and maybe now she and Kyousuke can become friends and get past the sexual harasser / brutalizer relationship they've had until now. 

** On Episode 13, July 19th, 2013:

This is the last episode of the second series; the conclusion will come later this year in OVA form. It was an unexpected pleasure: presumably to set up the reconciliation of Kirino and Manami, Episode 13 shows us a flashback from Kirino's perspective about how she came to hate Manami and how she and Kyousuke got to the terrible state they were in at the start of the series. 

Kirino tells us how, when she was young, she was a total oniichanko. (Her exact words.) She adored Kyousuke and how he always tried his best and seemed to know and be capable of doing everything, and always helped her out when she was in trouble. After a while, Manami came into the picture, and Kyousuke started to act a little bit more distant towards her; one day he didn't want to take Kirino along to Manami's (after an incident where she invited herself along with him and then got mad when she saw him and Manami sitting close together while Kyousuke showed Manami how to do a homework problem), so he told her she could only come if she could keep up with him, and ran off. Kirino couldn't keep up, got lost, and started crying; when it began to rain, though, Kyousuke came back for her and brought her home. 

After that, Kirino became determined to be as fast as Kyousuke—though she tells us that had absolutely nothing to do with the deterioration of her relationship, at least on her end. She started trying her best, became fast, and joined the track team. She tells Kyousuke proudly about her accomplishments, and while he is far from dismissive, it does seem like he isn't that interested. At this point, Kyousuke is still throwing himself into studies, athletics, and activities; when Kirino comes to tell him about winning the track meet, he is stapling pamphlets for his school festival. He modeled for the art on the cover. He invites Kirino to the festival, but she can't come because she has a track meet.

Over time, as Kyousuke enters middle school, Kirino notices him start to become lazy and worthless. One day, as he is lazing around on the couch reading manga, she confronts him about this, asking why he stopped giving his all. Kyousuke answers that he did used to do that, but he decided that the peaceful life is the best. When Kirino mentions studies, Kyousuke says he's managing to keep up and Manami is helping him. (It was the other way around a few years ago.) Angry, Kirino decides that he isn't her brother anymore. She runs over to Manami's house and demands that Manami give back her beloved oniichan, and Manami says she won't, and tells Kirino that the brother she loved never existed, and it's creepy for a brother and sister to be in love. This is the incident that causes Kirino to hate Manami and to stop acknowledging Kyousuke as her brother.

Some time later, Kirino meets Ayase for the first time at a modeling job. Kirino offers Ayase any help she can give since she's been modeling for a few months already at the time Ayase starts. Ayase tells Kirino that she started modeling because her mother suggested it, thinking it would be a good way for her daughter to learn about the world. (We did hear in the novels that Kirino was Ayase's sempai in modeling, and that Ayase came from a rather well-to-do, conservative family, though her house doesn't look that special when we see it in earlier episodes.) Ayase asks how Kirino started modeling, and Kirino, recalling Kyousuke's modeling for the cover of his school festival program, says she's taking after someone she admired; that person is now gone, she says, but if he ever comes back, she wants to be able to show him that she also managed to become an amazing person.

Some time later, in a bookstore with Ayase, Kirino sees a magazine (Comptiq or something to that effect) advertising "Imouto Maker", an erogame. Struck by the line "Oniichan daisuki" on the cover, she sneaks back later and buys it, and ends up buying a computer so she can play the game, and totally loving it. We also saw her watching a magical girl show at Manami's when she was younger, so these two things combine to make her an otaku. At some point the three otaku at the back of her class were complaining about all the little sister eroge coming out recently, and Ayase, seeing Kirino's angry expression, chased them off and commented on how creepy otaku are. This all led up to the start of the series, and Kirino reflects how even though her brother had become an ordinary person, he still said "Ore ni makaserou!" when she asked for life counseling, just like he used to when they were children. 

Little oniichanko Kirino was just stupidly, ridiculously, absolutely, criminally adorable. Her voice was extremely cute, without the shrillness of present day Kirino, though not as soft and quiet as Azu-nyan. While this story showed once again how Kirino is a passionate, hot-tempered person, it also showed once again that she isn't arbitrary or unreasonable, especially with regards to Manami. Her relationship with Kyousuke deteriorated in large part because of her disappointment with his new personality, but Manami played a part in this, and, I think, earned Kirino's antipathy. Kyousuke's own jealousy, which he admits to at various places, probably didn't help anything.

Some of the commenters were calling for the formation of the "I Hate Manami" Club in response to this episode. I have to say I didn't particularly like her after this episode. I was never a huge Manami fan to begin with, because she's kind of boring and Kyousuke seemed to have zero attraction to her, which made any story involving her kind of boring and awkward as she tries to interest him unsuccessfully. The giddiness Kyousuke felt anticipating his first day as Kuroneko's boyfriend was something Manami never seemed to come close to invoking in him. I did think that Kirino was being a little unreasonable with the extent of her hatred for Manami, but I don't think so anymore.

To be fair, I don't think Manami meant for what she said when Kirino confronted her to sound as bad as it did. When she responded to Kirino's demand for her oniichan back with "No", it sounded more jocular than anything, like Manami was trying to be friendly yet firm. When she told Kirino that Kirino's beloved oniichan never really existed, it seemed like she was just trying to teach Kirino something about perception and help Kirino get over her disappointment at the new, lazy Kyousuke. It was when she said it was creepy for a sister to be in love with her brother that I thought Manami went too far. I don't know what she was playing at; maybe she thought she was giving Kirino more tough love like with her previous statement. But it just sounded insulting, as if she were lording it over Kirino that she's more important to Kyousuke than his sister and that Kirino can never be as good as her because of being related. She also badly miscalculated how shaken up and angry Kirino was at the time, and possibly didn't know how hot-tempered Kirino is, so these lines couldn't have come at a worse time. It's not hard to see why Kirino hates her so much now. 

Not only that, her last line had a terrible effect on Kirino's psyche. Left alone, Kirino probably would have realized what Kyousuke was really like and fallen out of love with him on her own. Instead, Manami froze an image of a different Kyousuke in Kirino's mind, one that she remained in love with even when the real Kyousuke became a loser, and set herself up in Kirino's mind as the agent of Kyousuke's fall to loserdom. Rankled by Manami's words, Kirino stubbornly continued to believe they were wrong—and when she saw that line, "Oniichan daisuki", and played that game, where a brother and sister (who she gives her own name, by the way) fall in love and act lovey-dovey, it was like a confirmation that she was right, and Manami was wrong. So it seems that when she began with the little sister games, she was actually seeing herself in the sister's role; as time went on, she began to see herself in the brother's role (as the player) and came to love little sisters herself. Maybe it's another, very oblique form of the self praise that Kyousuke mentions her doing occasionally?

Now that Kirino has healed her relationship with Kyousuke, received all sorts of help from him, seen that he really can still be her beloved oniichan (she was standing outside the room when he screamed at their father to let her keep her collection), induced a breakup with a girl he liked much more than Manami, and even made him into a siscon, she can make peace with Manami. She won; she is now the most important woman in Kyousuke's life. Furthermore, the second most important is her close friend, Kuroneko, who has repeatedly proven her own devotion to Kirino, even breaking up with Kyousuke for Kirino's sake, and not someone like Manami who will take Kyousuke away and make him into someone else. Kirino has even shown Manami's statement that her beloved oniichan never existed to be partially wrong. Kyousuke may not be as cool as he once was, but he still leaps to her aid and puts everything he has into solving her problems, and he can still achieve good results with concentrated effort, as when he manages to get a high grade on his exam. Maybe Kirino wanted him to do well not just because he could come home if he did, but also to see that he really was as smart and dedicated as she remembered. 

Some of the commenters said that there was some incident that caused Kyousuke's change in personality which was described in the novels, and which Manami helped him through, making him dependent on her. I assume knowledge of this is the last piece that lets Kirino stop hating Manami. As I said, though, I don't think Manami was trying to be malicious (for the most part); it was largely bad timing and incorrect judgment that led to this. Most of the Ore Imo series has been about the rehabilitation of Kirino, from the horrible person she was at the beginning to the adorable and understandable little sister she has become. This was the last act in that rehabilitation. 

I haven't read the final novels, though they are translated. I might read them, or I might wait for the OVAs. But here's my prediction for how Ore Imo will end: everyone will be friends, but no one will hook up. I might be wrong. I don't think the series will go for the full-on incest ending, but maybe Kyousuke will hook up with Kuroneko again (which would be okay), or Ayase (which would be okay), or Manami (which I would be somewhat unhappy about), or Kanako (ugh!), or Saori (?!). But I predict that we'll be left with the current state, to guess that Kirino becomes secure enough to let Kuroneko and Kyousuke date again, and to bring about the happy ending in Kuroneko's Akashic Records. And I'm okay with that. I never expected to see how Ore Imo would end, so I'm just happy to have had it around for so long and to have been able to see the large amount of good material that was still left in the novels after the first OVA series.

** On the Final Ova episodes of Ore Imo, Dec 24th, 2013:

I finally saw the ending of Ore Imo.

It was really weird.

I think I liked the ending I predicted above better.

By the way, I now can't find where I read the bit about Kirino reconciling with Manami and helping out in her family's shop, but if I didn't just hallucinate the whole thing, it's definitely some sort of alternate universe, because that sort of thing would never happen in the main universe after what goes down in the last few episodes. I checked the final novel and it seems to be pretty much the same as the OVA, so I'm not sure what the hell was wrong with me.

Anyway, in Episode 14, Kyousuke receives his final "I hate you!" from Ayase right after she kisses him, and then proceeds to meet Kuroneko and destroy her by telling him he can't go out with her ever again because he's in love with Kirino. I missed the part where he actually decided this, so it was somewhat sudden. Poor Kuroneko is angry and tears apart her Akashic Records and curses him, using her chuunibyou personality to cover up just how devastated she is.

He invites Kirino out on a Christmas date to confess to her (and buy eroge). They meet Sena and her brother in line to buy the eroge; somehow Sena knows Kirino, also something I missed somewhere. Out on the street, Kyousuke starts to say that there's someone he loves, and Kirino is afraid and runs away. Suddenly, Saori, Kaori, and Kuroneko drive up in a Scion and invite Kyousuke in. Kaori and Saori have made up after having a long talk about what happened back in the day and Kaori has become her little sister's slave, a condition that Kyousuke sympathizes with. Kuroneko doesn't talk much but she's somehow not mad anymore (I guess she probably saw this coming).

They catch up to Kirino, and Kyousuke stops her and confesses his love to her. When Kirino asks why he turned down Kuroneko for her when they're siblings and can't do anything or get married, Kuroneko plays a recording of him on big loudspeakers when he told her that he loved Kirino and hence couldn't be with her. The entire street hears him (he lost his mind and made a huge spectacle of himself anyway, though). Kyousuke says he's going to be like those guys in eroge who go through anything to be with their sisters and asks if Kirino will marry him. Kirino says yes.

In Episode 15, they go back to the hotel that Kyousuke booked for their date (to put the stuff in) and discuss what to do now. Kirino says she was going to confess to him, even if she got rejected, but she was suddenly nervous when he started talking and couldn't take it and ran off. They know they can't really get married or anything, so they discuss a little bit what to do. Kirino comes up with a plan and whispers it in his ear so the audience can't hear it; Kyousuke agrees.

Somewhere in there, Kanako also invites Kyousuke to a concert and confesses to him in front of the entire audience; Kyousuke rejects her and says he has a girlfriend he loves and he can't go out with Kanako. Kanako says she's going to become so amazing that he'll regret turning her down.

We also see that Saori and Kuroneko are still hanging out with them; Saori says she thinks their relationship is a little weird, but as long as the four of them can still hang out, she doesn't care. Kuroneko fights with Kirino like always. (Kyousuke actually leaves from here to go to Kanako's concert; he pats Kirino on the head as he leaves, and she complains that he's going to mess up her hair.)

It turns out that the thing Kirino wouldn't let Kyousuke see in the first series just before she went abroad was an iPod loaded up with recordings she made for her future self about her feelings for him when she was younger. They listen to them together now, and Kirino admits that she's been in love with him for a long time and 

In Episode 16, Kyousuke graduates from high school. Sena and Makabe ended up dating, which makes Akagi mad, especially when Makabe calls him Oniisan. Sena heard from Kirino about their relationship and says although she can't imagine ever wanting to date her brother, when Kirino was bragging about it, she seemed so happy that Sena decided to just leave it alone.

Kirino meets Kyousuke at the front gate and playfully yanks off his second button, then tries to steal his tie, almost strangling him. He gives it to her and they start walking home, only to be met by Manami, who says she came to fight with Kirino.

They go into a clearing and Kirino opens by lording it over Manami that she won and Kyousuke is hers. Manami responds by punching her in the stomach. They have a full-on punching, hair-pulling slap fight which ends when Kirino punches Manami in the face and breaks her glasses. From their screaming during the fight, Kyousuke realizes that the person Kirino spoke of with such anger in the recording while admitting she was right is Manami, and it dawns on him that their first battle came long ago and that Kirino's hatred for Manami was not just her usual bitchiness. Kyousuke pulls them apart and Manami says that their relationship is absurd and disgusting, and asks what they think they're going to do when they're thirty, what their parents will think, how they can possibly carry on like this. Kyousuke says he's going to be like the heroes in eroge—even though he doesn't think that the eyes of society are a trivial and worthless thing like those guys do, he still wants to fight for his right to be in love with his sister. Kirino thinks he's cool, until Manami threatens to tell their father and he crumples. Kyousuke says he'll do anything Manami wants, even get down on his knees and beg, for her to not do that. Manami asks what he'd do if she tells anyway, and Kyousuke doesn't have an answer; she then asks what would happen if she said she likes him, and got down on her knees and begged him to go out with her. Kyousuke is surprised, because he (apparently) genuinely never suspected that she liked him. But he says, one last time, that he loves Kirino and he wants to be with her. Manami says this is goodbye and leaves.

Kirino, crying, says she feels so bad that he's always doing such insane things on her behalf; now he's done the most insane thing of all, turning down a whole line of girls who liked him. (I don't think he missed much in most of their cases, though.) He replies that all of them were too good for him and he knows he'll never be this popular again. Kyousuke tells Kirino they should get married.

We next see them in a church, standing at the altar. No one else is there. They pass a moment in remembrance of everything that's happened, and then they kiss. Afterwards, Kirino takes off the ring that Kyousuke gave her during their Christmas date and gives it back to him. We then see what Kirino's suggestion that day was: that they would date until graduation, and then go back to being normal siblings. With their marriage, the spell is broken and they're once again siblings.

In the final scene, Kyousuke and Kirino go to Akihabara to meet up with Saori and welcome a new member to Saori's otaku group. Kirino hopes she's a cute little sister-type with black twin-tails. Kyousuke sneaks up on her and kisses her on the cheek, and Kirino says he can't do stuff like that now that they're siblings again and runs off.

This was a really weird ending. I can't really figure out why they did it, either. It almost reminds me of one of those tortured constructions they use in eroge endings when the whole story comes from so far out of left field that there was basically no way to introduce it into the story without writing two separate games that branch early on. I feel like there should have been a "Far Side of the Moon" style split where we led into this story, and also a "Near Side" where Kyousuke chose Kuroneko. It was also kind of unsatisfying, for reasons I'll go into more below.

The cascade of confessions and rejections was also pretty weird, but to engage with the story on its own level, I don't think Kyousuke was missing much with most of them. Here's the probable course of most of them, even if we factor out Kirino and her jealousy:

Ayase: He forgets their five-minute anniversary one day and Ayase stabs his eyes out with a screwdriver while screaming "ROSES! I WAS EXPECTING ROSES, EVERY DAY AT 2:49!!!"
Kanako: She becomes a black-lunged, yellow-toothed, bloody-gummed tar-smelling old nineteen-year-old who screams at him for cigarettes and liquor. Kirino seduces him one day, after which he pushes Kanako's wheelchair down a staircase.
Manami: He leads a stultifying existence where Manami pretends to be a goody-goody and forces him to engage in a comedy routine with her grandparents every day. In other words, every day is like Episode 6 from the first series (which I skipped one time when I was rewatching the series. It was the second-worst, but only because Episode 8 was so bad. The ending song was pretty good, though).

I think the worst thing about this cascade was that Kuroneko got robbed. The writers knew they couldn't just have her leave town and never be heard from again, because she's so popular. They also couldn't devote the time to have her deal with this onscreen, because they had to fit in the confession cascade, so they just had her "be okay with it, after being mad for about three hours that her first love dumped her for his sister". Kuroneko's sort of a doormat throughout the second series, which just makes her cuter, in my opinion, but I did want her to have a happy ending, and instead she got no ending at all.  

(BTW, if Koyomi Araragi pulled that move—which, by the way, I wouldn't mind—Hitagi would just kill him. But Kuroneko's no Hitagi. She's not even Tsubasa, who was also sort of a doormat but was at least angry about it.)

Don't get me wrong—I like Kirino, and I liked seeing these cute moments from her, like when she steals Kyousuke's button or when they listen to the recordings together. Also, I think the ending leaves open the possibility that Kuroneko could come back in. But I don't want to write fanfics about it, I want it to happen.

Here's an ending that would have satisfied me: Kirino lets Kyousuke listen to the recordings and realizes that now that he loves her (as a sister) and is an otaku along with her, they're pretty much together forever and she doesn't need to feel threatened anymore. She decides that it's not just okay, but wonderful that he's in love with her good friend, since this glues them together even more closely. She blesses their relationship, and it continues. Manami confesses to Kyousuke and Kyousuke says he has someone else he loves; Manami rants that his relationship with Kirino is gross and Kyousuke says it's not Kirino, he's with Kuroneko again. Manami goes and fucks herself. The happy ending in Kuroneko's Akashic Records comes to pass, and the three of them sit at Kuroneko's table and have a fun time together.

Here's another ending that I would have been okay with: After the Christmas date (during which time Kuroneko is most assuredly not okay with what happened), Kyousuke and Kirino come to her together and ask for her blessing. Kuroneko is loath to give it, but says she'll think about it. The confrontation with Manami happens as before on graduation day, and Kyousuke and Kirino go to the church and get married. Then Kirino takes off the ring, and Kuroneko comes in, also wearing a wedding dress. It turns out that they told Kuroneko about their love ending after graduation; Kuroneko was hurt by Kyousuke's manner of rejecting her, but she decided that she would wait for him. Kirino passes the ring to Kuroneko, and makes it clear that she's moved on and is okay with their relationship now, and Kuroneko goes up to the altar, where Kyousuke puts the ring on her and kisses her. The three of them go together to the otaku meeting.

It just galls me, because the main plotline of series two was the love triangle (?) between Kyousuke, Kirino, and Kuroneko. Even though Kyousuke became more and more unhinged as the show went on with regard to being a perverted siscon, it seemed like he really loved Kuroneko, and I felt sure he would go back to her. It just feels like that plotline was never actually resolved. They started a new plotline about Kirino and Manami after going off on a tangent about Ayase and never finished with it. But that was the plotline I cared about; that was the plot that made me keep watching series two. Kuroneko even seems to have more fans than Kirino, so I'm surprised they would cop out like this on her plot. 

I guess I was stupid to be fair to Manami before. She was terrible after all. I never liked her that much from the beginning, although early on I felt like I should. She was just boring at first. Now she's evil. I don't mind them making Manami into a villain, and I thought that Kyousuke tossing her off when she confessed was pretty symbolic of his decision to take up with Kirino, Kuroneko, and Saori and become an otaku instead of leading the kind of boring normal life that Manami convinced him to want. It also made some sense in the context of her relationship with Ayase; Ayase has been pretty fundamentalist the whole series about being normal and not being creepy and otaku, so it makes some sense that Manami would be too. And it also seems apparent that Manami really was trying to steal Kyousuke from Kirino since she liked him too. That's why I included the Manami thing in both of my alternate endings above: because they did need to conclude that thread from Episode 13, but given that it only took up about a third of the final episode, they still could have squeezed in a Kuroneko plot.

Speaking of Ayase, I guess she's gone. Kirino must not have been hanging out with her, because I can't imagine her being okay with Kirino dating Kyousuke. And Kirino is pretty terrible at keeping secrets, so I doubt she kept it hidden. That plot was kind of an anticlimax too, but not like Kuroneko's.

I did really enjoy Ore Imo. What I said about it after the end of the first series is still pretty much the truth. But this ending highlighted a lot of its shortcomings in a way that made me think maybe it doesn't deserve to be in the same category as Monogatari or Clannad when it comes to being a favorite series (i.e. in the top five). Still, I owe it for reinvigorating my interest in anime and making me a siscon. (Is that a good thing?) Even though I paradoxically argued against the incest ending that they did here, because I was so taken in by the Kuroneko story that constituted the majority of series two.

** Some more complaints about the ending, 2014-1-6:

Last night I read a review by someone who basically detested the entire second series and bitched about the ending and how stupid it was. At first I thought this reviewer must be someone who just hates harem and moe stuff, but about halfway through they said they really liked the first series, but hated the second series so much that they recommended just watching the first series and ignoring the sequel if you hadn't seen any of them yet. I thought they were way too hard on it, but I didn't disagree with their central thesis, which was that the second series wasn't very good, that it inched closer and closer to the shark as it went on and finally jumped it in Episode 14, and that the best parts were the parts where Kyousuke and Kuroneko date, but the ending just threw away all that, as well as all the Kuroneko development in earlier stories, like garbage.

It's just a waste, a travesty, that they spent so long building up Kuroneko and then gave her absolutely no ending at all. She didn't even really get over Kyousuke; she was just suddenly fine with it. To be honest, I didn't like Kuroneko when I first started watching the series, since she seemed like kind of a bitch. But I liked her by Episode 7, and I loved her by Episode 9, and the whole OVA and most of Series II was like a thesis on why Kuroneko is awesome and is the best match for Kyousuke. Consider the following:

- Kyousuke becomes friends with Kuroneko before he becomes friends with Kirino. By Episode 4, he can talk somewhat comfortably with her. By Episode 9, he can call her just to chat. He can't have a decent conversation with Kirino until Episode 12.

- Kuroneko is so loyal to Kirino that she hates Manami just by reputation and calls her "Belphegor" (which was awesome, by the way). She also jumps through hoops to date Kyousuke in a way that Kirino will be okay with.

- Her end goal is to make a beautiful friendship between herself, Kyousuke, and Kirino. Kirino's end goal is to date her brother so those other bitches can't have him. Kyousuke's end goal is to not get his ass kicked by his fourteen-year-old sister.

- She's the only character who grows as a person during the series. Kirino, although she does get better, mostly just reverts to her childhood. Kyousuke degenerates as a person by becoming an otaku siscon who loses his mind at the slightest prompting. Kuroneko manages to overcome her pride and aloofness and make friends with Sena, as well as show her honest emotions to Kirino and Kyousuke.

- She was a pretty good person even before the series: she takes good care of her little sisters and supports her parents by doing the housework. Her otaku hobbies were a way to let off stress.

- Kyousuke says in the novels that his ideal girl would have Ayase's looks and Manami's personality. Maybe Kuroneko isn't quite as good looking as Ayase, but she's still a real beauty, as Kyousuke says in the novels. She's much more biddable than Ayase, and she has some of Manami's traits of doing housework and taking care of people, but she's a lot more fun, and is also more tolerant and open-minded, than Manami. She's also Kirino's good friend, unlike Manami, so the amount of friction there should be a lot less.

- Pursuant to above: she has a good sense of humor and fun and a certain spontaneity. Kamineko. Belphegor. "Ahh...*kusu kusu kusu* Oniichan no pantsu!". "True, you just stumbled around like a clumsy oaf doing whatever you wanted, and were no help at all." All of these are great jokes or lines that were spoken or executed by Kuroneko. She's also extremely understanding; there was almost no friction when she was dating Kyousuke, not because she'll put up with anything, but because she was willing to hear him out and discuss things with him instead of leaping to conclusions and slapping him.

There's even more I could say, but I can't think of how to organize it. There are characters who have my undying love, like Karen-chan or Azu-nyan, who despite having my undying love, could not be glorified at such length as I have done above to Kuroneko. 

Kuroneko *earned* that ending, dammit.

What I can't figure out is why it wasn't overwhelmingly obvious to Fushimi that things should end like this. The series didn't really run itself past its expiration date or back itself into a corner. It actually built very skillfully towards a certain kind of ending, one with the basic elements of Kyousuke and Kirino repairing their relationship and Kyousuke and Kuroneko happily dating. 

Then it just threw out everything it had built and did something completely different and nonsensical.

It's like ending Death Note by having Light kill Near and everyone else, then become God, then decide he's bored and one year later the world is just like it was before the series began.

It's like ending Aria by having Akari decide that being an Undine isn't for her and going into the stockbroker business.

It's like ending Haibane Renmei with Kuu coming back and Reki staying.

Strangely enough, it's like ending Yosuga no Sora *without* incest. 

And that's all I'll say. This ending unfortunately highlighted the flaws of Ore Imo more than the triumphs, and I really wish it had been different. But there we go.

By the way, there's an Ore Imo / To Aru Kagaku no Railgun crossover story where Kirino and Mikoto chat, and Kyousuke and Touma hang out. Kyousuke thinks Saten is cute. In this instance, he had good taste.

** <2014-06-16 Mon>

They should have ended the series with Kirino confessing her love to Kuroneko. That would have been awesome.
** <2014-11-14 Fri> About the later novels (Vols. 6, 7, 8, 9)
These novels cover the bulk of Series II. Volume 9 ends with the story where Kirino is in a wedding dress and Kyousuke rides her to the concert on Mikagami’s eroge bike. Volumes 10, 11, and 12 cover the last few episodes of Series II and the OVAs.

Now that I’ve read the novels, I’m truly puzzled by some of the decisions made by the anime producers. Volume 6 has four stories: one that corresponds to Series II, Episode 3, and three that were never or were only partially adapted. Volume 7 covers the fake boyfriend plot with Mikagami. Almost all of these stories contained important, interesting, or fun scenes that were never adapted—except for the one that corresponds to Series II, Episode 3, the story with Ria, which contains nothing interesting except for naked twelve-year-old glomping, which is fine (if you’re a lolicon), but definitely not as interesting or funny as, say, Kirino showing Kuroneko her otaku closet, or seeing Kyousuke and Akagi go to a sex shop in Akihabara, where Akagi buys a magazine with a sex doll that looks like Sena in it while Kyousuke is incredibly uncomfortable, or seeing the rehabilitation of Kanako and her subsequent crush on Kyousuke unfold in a somewhat sensible manner. (It still doesn’t make me like her, but it’s better than how the anime did it.)

The only good part of the Ria story was early on when Kyousuke tries to explain why he’s not a lolicon by telling us his personal ordering on the girls by appearance. He says he prefers someone more mature, like Ayase, and gives the following chart:

Ayase>>>>>>>>>>(Impassable Angel’s wall~) >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Sena ( <3 breasts) >>>>Fate-san>>Bridget>>>>>>>>>>>>>Kanako 

to show why he’s not a lolicon because Kanako is ranked last. (Incidentally, that kind of looks like my character ranking where I added characters I don’t really care about just to demote Kanako.) Obviously, it was impossible to put that in the anime. 

In general, one of the interesting parts of the novels, aside from hearing how Kyousuke was really feeling when he did some of the bizarre things he does, is hearing what he really thinks about the girls. He pretty much always ranks Ayase as Number One, although he likes big boobs, which is why Sena and Fate-san scored where they did in his partial ordering of girl hotness. He definitely does think that Kuroneko is good-looking, and he certainly has feelings for her while they’re going out, but his praise for her is never as unceasing as his praise for Ayase. (Poor Kuroneko seems to think much more highly of him than he does of her.) As for Manami, his statement early on in the anime that it’s as if his favorite grandmother were reincarnated in the body of a high school girl becomes quite clear in the novels; he is not attracted to her in the slightest, and views her only as a companion and source of homespun wisdom. Which I suppose is just. (A few times, Manami tries to convince him that Ayase is the best girl for him, probably as part of their weird little compact. I think he might have mentioned being attracted to Ayase to Manami way back in the second novel. But by now, Kyousuke knows that he can’t be with Ayase, even if he’s attracted to her, because she’s too volatile and holier-than-thou, and Kyousuke wants someone more dere-dere, like Kuroneko or Kirino after the fall.)   

The Mikagami subplot and the Kuroneko dating survived into the anime pretty much unchanged, although in the novels we get to hear about Kyousuke’s dislike for Mikagami, which always seemed more situational than personal in the anime. In the novels, it is personal, but also situational, and Kyousuke begins to like him more after the situational aspect is gone. The main thing missing from the Mikagami subplot was Comiket before they run into Mikagami; the Game Research Club arrives and Kirino, although initially shy, ends up talking to Sena and getting along with her. Maybe that wasn’t that important to the main plot, but I did like it. There was a ton of stuff I liked in these novels that wasn’t in the anime, and at least some of it could have gone in instead of that terrible episode where Kirino is addicted to that game with the heroine who looks and sounds like Ayase, which, while good from the standpoint of Kirino x Ayase yuri (or rather, Ayase x Kirino, since Ayase would probably be the seme), was overall bad. We also could have gotten some of this instead of the Ria episode, since there was really nothing about that episode that logically led into the fake boyfriend story.

The Kuroneko dating plot, which unfolds over Volume 8, is actually shorter, because the anime version incorporates material from a story in Volume 9 called “My Big Sister is a Denpa Maiden and a Holy Angel” that’s written from the perspective of Hinata Gokou. For example, the Kamineko scene from the anime (one of my favorite scenes of Series II), came from this story. Hinata didn’t think Kyousuke was real, since her big sister Ruri had a history of making up friends and entering them in her cell phone, then holding long, one-sided conversations with them as she did strange rituals in her room. However, Hinata is happy when Ruri makes friends with Kirino and Saori and changes her cell phone wallpaper to a picture of them together, from its previous picture of Hinata. Hinata is also surprised and relieved to find that Kyousuke really exists.

I always liked Hinata in the anime, and her story is awesome, possibly one of the best written of all the Ore Imo stories, and certainly one of the funniest. I especially liked one scene where Hinata queries Ruri about her boyfriend; hearing that Kyousuke isn’t very handsome, that “in his current form, he has no combat abilities” and that Ruri can’t confess to him because there’s another woman involved, Hinata thinks that he sure does have a lot of baggage for an imaginary boyfriend.

Volume 9 has miscellaneous stories written from perspectives other than Kyousuke’s, most of them humorous, although the story about Saori’s past is a combination of “Chameleon Daughter”, one of the Volume 9 stories, and another story from Volume 6 where the others go to visit Saori and bring her Gundam models as gifts. (Kuroneko of course gets her Deathscythe, which the translators mistakenly read as “Death-size” and then added a note saying they have no idea what that means.) “Girls’ Talk Late at Night” is from Kirino’s perspective and happens after the Kousaka siblings confront Kuroneko in the hot springs town. They end up staying at the same inn, in the same two rooms, with Kirino, Kuroneko, and Tamaki in one room and Kyousuke, Hinata, and the Gokou parents in the other. Kirino is worried about Kyousuke in this arrangement, but she has the distraction of two little sisters to occupy her. She apparently loses her mind and does something terrible to Tamaki in the baths; afterwards, Ruri tells her that it’s okay with Hinata, but Tamaki is still young. (I assume it wasn’t lesbian rape, otherwise Ruri wouldn’t be saying it was okay with Hinata. But maybe a minor sort of lesbian rape, like the “horsing around in the bath” that goes on between girls in other anime.)

Hinata comes in and says Gokou-otousan was interrogating Kyousuke and Kyousuke said something really cool that amazed her. She says that if Ruri doesn’t marry him, she will, and then Kirino can be her big sister for real. (Hinata idolizes Kirino, and also appreciates her for befriending lonely, deluded Ruri-nee.) Ruri threatens to stop feeding her meals forever, and Kirino says that Hinata is already her wife.

In “My Little Sister is Extremely Cute”, we hear from Akagi Kouhei about how he discovered Sena’s fujoshi hobby. Since Kouhei and Sena already had a good relationship, it wasn’t a big event like with Kyousuke and Kirino. Sena was hiding in the closet watching Kouhei work out so she could use him as a model for yaoi, and at one point, Kouhei admits that he isn’t nice to other girls like he is to Sena and that must be because he’s childish and prefers to play football with the guys. Sena says that might mean he has the capacity to become gay, like she asked him to do for her. 

Later, he and Kyousuke compete over whose little sister is cutest. They duel with pictures—Akagi’s are self-shot, while Kyousuke begins with magazine pictures and gets Akagi into a side trip about Lovely Angel Ayase-tan, then progresses to personal shots, and finally shows Akagi the photo booth picture from their date. Kirino even sends him a selfie of herself with a beautiful smile to answer Akagi’s challenge, but as they’re standing on Akagi’s doorstep, Sena comes outside and finishes the battle by having Kyousuke take a picture of her kissing her brother on the cheek. Kyousuke comes home, defeated, and tells Kirino how he lost, and Kirino says she won’t do that with him. 

Kirino narrates another story about her day out with Sena, and Ayase narrates a story about a disastrous backstage incident with Kanako and Bridget. Kanako asks Ayase to bring back Kyousuke as her manager since he claimed to be her first fan, but Ayase says he was fired for sexually harrassing her. She brings him anyway and notices how Kanako melts over his polite, meaningless words of praise, and thinks how stupid Kanako is. (So it wasn’t just me who noticed that.) The members of ClariS, Clara and Alice, come backstage to tell Kanako that they’re her fans too, but Kanako, not realizing who they are, talks herself up over them, and then Kyousuke ends up with his head up Clara’s skirt as he saves her stage outfit from getting tea spilled on it.

Volume 9 is really good. I wish they’d incorporated a little more of this into the anime, but unlike with the earlier volumes, I can see why they had trouble. Still, I think they could’ve chosen a better story than the wedding dress one to adapt. But I’m glad I decided to read the novels, because it’s making me remember why I ever liked this series.
** <2014-11-15 Sat> About Volumes 9, 10, 11
I liked the way “Chameleon Daughter” is integrated into the plot a lot better in the novels than in the anime. It takes place just after the hot springs trip, with Saori angry because she was left out of everything and felt excluded from her own group. The flashback, which makes up most of the story as it does in the anime (which took most of its framing sequence from Volume 6, Chapter 3), explains why Saori feels the way she does about this group and what went on.

The story about Kirino and Sena on their day out was super funny. Sena tortures Kirino by talking about how her brother is gay and he and Kyousuke are a gay couple. They also argue over which of their brothers is a bigger siscon. The story ends with Sena making a drawing of Kyosuke with “Kirino-kun”, a male version of Kirino who is the dominant one in their gay relationship. 

The wedding dress story is a lot shorter than in the anime, which is all to the good since it went on for way too long. 

Volume 10 covers the subplot with Kyousuke living alone and receiving help from all the girls. This is largely the same as the anime. I looked back and saw I was really hard on the party scene where the girls argue over who should take care of Kyousuke, which I think was fair, mostly. On the other hand, I did feel the rehabilitation of Kanako was much better handled in the novel. But overall, things get pretty out there in Volume 10, I guess because this is where we finally toss together all the characters and shake them up together. These previously isolated little worlds where the characters would interact in neat subsets are now all tossed in together, with sometimes confusing and unbelievable results. 

The first chapter of Volume 10 is actually a story about Mikagami, though. He comes to get back his bicycle, Shooting Star, with naked Meruru on it, but tells Kyousuke to keep it. Akagi also shows up, and Kyousuke, who doesn’t want his mother to hear the siscon Akagi and Mikagami’s interpretation of his and Kirino’s relationship in terms of little sister eroge, decides they should all go out somewhere. They end up at Mikagami’s apartment, where they see that Mikagami has several cases full of his own jewelry and other handicrafts, and a case with a life-size sex doll in it just past the entrance. They also meet Mikagami’s brother, who turns out to be pretty nice even though he’s annoyed with Mikagami. Kyousuke and Akagi think it’s inconsiderate of Mikagami to put a sex doll at the entrance of his brother’s apartment, until they find that Mikagami pays for the apartment and his brother is just a guitar-playing carioca (meaning he seduces women so he can sponge off them for his livelihood). 

Kyousuke comes out of it thinking Mikagami is actually a pretty good guy, which I liked. Mikagami’s kind of mischievous and he definitely has that oblivious otaku thing going, and that, combined with the fact that he’s rich and handsome, makes him kind of hard to like. (For instance, he seemed to enjoy Kyousuke’s consternation at finding his relationship with Kirino was fake just a little too much.) On the other hand, he actually does have an earnest and humble side, and he genuinely tries to befriend Kyousuke and never once looks down on him, so he is really a pretty good guy. Akagi thinks so too, as another man who (despite Sena’s allegations) isn’t gay and had no particular reason to like or dislike Mikagami. 

Mikagami also shows that he’s a pretty good guy later on during an Ayase subplot that wasn’t in the anime. Kyousuke and Akagi have both been visiting a fan blog whose maintainer takes candid photos of Ayase and posts them. As a moving-in present, Mikagami sends Kyousuke a nice cabinet (like the ones in his apartment) and a set of erotic figurines for the eroge “Imouto-wife” that Kirino gave Kyousuke as a moving-in gift along with the mini refrigerator. Kyousuke spends an uncomfortable evening with his father assembling the cabinet and putting the figures in it. Later, Ayase sees them, despite his attempts to cover it up. She goes to look at some of the non-erotic ones as a way to understand Kirino better. The blogger takes a picture of her doing this, and also sees her going to Kyousuke’s apartment and puts up an announcement on her blog that if Ayase doesn’t reflect on her actions, she’ll ruin Ayase. 

Kyousuke doesn’t tell Ayase right away; instead he contacts Mikagami, who notifies the modeling agency. Mikagami also tries to do counter-stalking by dressing up as a girl and stalking Ayase as well, but it backfires. (He just wanted to crossdress.) On the morning of his exam, Kyousuke uncovers the stalker and makes her and Ayase sit down and talk things out. It turns out to be Kakei Sayaka, an elementary school kouhai of Ayase’s who admired her. Ayase clears things up with Sayaka and then confesses to Kyousuke, as in the anime, but we don’t see what happens after the confession.

This plot was pretty ridiculous, so I’m glad it wasn’t animated. Even though the Ayase subplot felt a little rushed and empty in the anime, and even though it meant pretty much all of Mikagami’s parts got cut, still, this subplot was pretty ridiculous. 

But there was one thing that I was sad to see cut: the strange union of Ayase and Kuroneko. The first meeting, where they fight and Kuroneko says she’s a better friend to Kirino because she would even be okay if Kyousuke and Kirino had sex, was in. This established their antipathy. And that, you would think, is the sensible state for them. After all, Ayase hates otaku, and Kuroneko is 100% otaku; Ayase is Kirino’s best non-otaku friend and gets clingy and possessive over Kirino, while Kuroneko is Kirino’s best otaku friend and a major competitor for Kirino’s attention; and both of them are in love with Kyousuke, Ayase covertly and Kuroneko overtly. These two should be like oil and water, Sturm und Drang, darkness and light, angels and demons. But one day, Kyousuke returns to his room to find Ayase stepping on Kuroneko’s stomach while Kuroneko breathes erotically. 

Kuroneko explains in her usual incomprehensible manner that she discovered Ayase was harboring a darkness inside her and that she is the reincarnation of a dark angel, and that what Kyousuke saw was a ceremony to link their souls and bring the darkness of Ayase’s former life to the surface. Ayase pretty much can’t say anything and doesn’t even object when Kyousuke characterizes it as some kind of lesbian S&M ritual. Kirino later (in the Volume 12 preview at the end of Volume 11) comes to Ayase’s house and finds them doing it again, only with Kuroneko stepping on Ayase this time. Her reaction is pretty much like Kyousuke’s.

All this time, I thought that Kuroneko was the only completely straight female character who only liked guys and preferred guys with girls over guys with guys or girls with girls, and it turns out to be untrue. Not that I’m complaining—I really wanted to see something develop between Kirino and Kuroneko, and I’m disappointed at how few Kuroneko x Kirino doujinshi there are. And Ayase was my second-favorite after Kuroneko, and there were always signs that she liked girls. Plus, the total lack of explanation of how they ever came to try this arrangement out is probably the only way this could have possibly worked. So I’m sad they cut that, but I do understand, because it’s not vital and it was pretty weird.
** <2014-11-17 Mon> About Volume 12 and more of Volume 11
The ending still sucks just as much as it did in the anime. If anything, I was struck even more by just how sudden and unnatural its development is. I totally bought that Kirino was an important person to Kyousuke now and that he doted on her and wanted to keep her safe and nurture her friendships and celebrate her victories with her, and I was willing to accept that these newfound brotherly feelings explained why he was willing to keep away from other girls for Kirino’s sake. But I never, ever, up until the very moment Kyousuke idiotically ended his romance with Kuroneko forever, thought that that was enough for the basis of a romantic relationship, even a normal one, let alone a weird one between blood-related siblings.

Volume 12 wasn’t a complete waste, though. The Ayase subplot went on a little more than in the anime via some flashbacks to time they spent together while Kyousuke was living at the apartment, and we also got one more glorious scene from the period when Kyousuke and Kuroneko were going out, with more of Hinata and Tamaki and more Ruri dandere. But the Christmas scene where Kyousuke and Kirino play eroge at the hotel went on for way too long, and the scene where Kyousuke confesses with the aid of Kuroneko, Saori, and Kaori was just as painful and ridiculous as it was in the anime. The novel also never does a full disclosure Kirino story like Episode 13 of Series II, so a lot of things that went on between Kirino and Manami or in Kirino’s mind are only hinted at. All this combines to make the romance even more awkward, pointless, and dissatisfying than it was in the anime.

The novel adds one more to the cascade of confessions that Kyousuke receives. In Volume 11, Manami relates a whole story to Kirino while she’s maintaining a temporary truce about when Kyousuke was in middle school. He was the class rep, and he had a policy of leaving a book out where people could write down requests that he would try to fulfill. Someone wrote that a student named Sakurai had stopped coming to class, so Kyousuke tracked her down and convinced her to come. Sakurai was basically an otaku and hikikomori, who got away with anything because her parents were rich and were never around. Of course, like all otaku in Ore Imo, she was super cute and in love with Kyousuke, but Kyousuke never found this out because she fell off a cliff just as she was going to confess. (It makes sense in context.) Sakurai’s parents blamed him for this and changed her school, and after this, Manami convinced Kyousuke to give up and stop being an amazing person. This spurred Kirino to do what she did, as we saw in the anime. So in some sense, the novel and anime are complementary; the anime never tells us about Sakurai, so we never know why Kyousuke became a lazy-ass, but the novel is vague on what Kirino was really thinking and doing all that time and how she actually first became an otaku, which the anime explains.

Kyousuke and Sakurai meet up again in the present after Kyousuke remembers this and decides to find her. It turns out she and Kirino play the same cell phone social game, so he finds her and she tells him that she was going to confess her love. Kyousuke rejects her. Later, he and Kirino meet her just after they start dating and Kirino shamelessly tells her that they’re dating even though they’re brother and sister; Sakurai is disappointed that she lost to his sister and says she wanted to have a “futon date”, where she and her boyfriend lay around in a small room under the covers and watch anime and play games.
