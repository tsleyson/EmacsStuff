Use TK to build a GUI interface (I can't believe Ken Joy made his ECS
40 students build GUIs with Qt Creator. That seems like borderline
insanity given the failure rates of that class.)

Use matrices to represent the equations (Ruby has a built-in matrix
class.) In matrix form, we can think of what we have to do with the
numbers like this:

We have an A matrix that holds all the death rates, and an x vector
that holds the populations. We have a b vector that holds the birth
rates. To calculate the change in population at time t, we can
calculate the following:

Î”x(t) = x(t) .* (b - Ax(t))

where x(t) is the population at time t, b is the birthrate vector, and
A is the deathrate matrix. .* is the Matlab element-wise
multiplication operator.
