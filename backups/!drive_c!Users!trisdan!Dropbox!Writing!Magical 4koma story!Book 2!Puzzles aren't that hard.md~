Puzzles aren't that hard. By Lily.
==================================
How are you? I'm Lily.

Even though I've never talked to you before, I'm not here today to tell you about myself. I'm pretty boring, to be honest. I have the Gift of Gardening. If you've ever thought about which superpower you'd choose if you could have any you like, you probably didn't choose gardening.

Today I'm going to tell you about something that happened to my friend Nora. She wouldn't tell you herself because she didn't want to sound like she was bragging. But even if she did brag a little, I think that would be all right, because Nora has a gift that's a lot more amazing than my gardening. But she got embarrassed when I told her, and said she didn't like to boast or brag, and wouldn't talk about it anymore. Even though she's really smart—I might even say she's a genius—she's so modest. She's the opposite of someone like Cora, who has a little talent and a big mouth. That's why I love her. Well, one of the reasons. 

Nora and I had known each other for about three weeks when this happened. She'd been helping me in the garden, and had joined my club, the Helping Hands. We'd helped Ms. Rutherford clean the PE shed together; we'd gotten rid of a dog for the student council; and we'd gone on a camping trip with the Geology club. Nothing much had happened since the camping trip, and we'd spent most of our days drinking tea in the clubroom while Cora and Ranta fought over various things.

Nora didn't know I had spent most of the nights of the past three weeks sleeping in a hammock in the garden, strung up between two Artillerinut trees (those are the trees that shot at her just before she and I met. I felt so bad about that!). I would eat dinner in the elementary school dining hall with my friends, and then I would go out and head for the middle school building. On the way, I'd take a detour to the garden and spend the night there. I'd wake up with the rising sun and go over to the middle school dormitory, and slip into my room and change clothes while my roommate was at breakfast. Then I'd go to breakfast, attend morning classes, then slip back into the room and change into my gardening clothes, and go work in the garden through afternoon classes, heading over to the clubroom when the elementary school classes let out.

But last night, I'd stepped through the dewy grass, cool with the air of the setting sun, and lain down on my hammock only to find there was a chilly breeze passing between the two trees, which made it too cold to sleep there. I had thought for a minute about what to do. I decided the best thing was to sneak into the clubroom; no one would be there at this time of night.

The gates of the elementary school area were shut, but all I had to do was climb the fence and I was in. I couldn't directly climb on the tall, smooth black iron poles, but there was a nice growth of ivy wrapped around them that I could use to climb up to the top, as long as I kept my weight spread out enough that I didn't break any of the vines. I clambered over the spiky tops of the poles and came down in the courtyard, glad for my thick boots that absorbed the shock of my hard landing.

The office building looked eerie in the twilight, like a haunted house just before the Witching Hour was to begin. Rays of orange light were bouncing off the windows, like the glow in the eyes of a dying tiger. But even though I felt like I was doing something bad, I knew I had to get in there. Otherwise I might wake up tomorrow with a cold, and then who would look after the garden?

I came around the building to the tall white doors, so happy and inviting by day, so gloomy and forbidding by evening. The lights in the lobby were still on, but it looked like most of the windows were dark. I tried the knob. It was still unlocked, so someone was inside, but I hoped I'd be able to get to the clubroom without being spotted.

My hopes were dashed the moment I opened the door; standing in the lobby, just getting ready to lock up, was one of the elementary school teachers. He wasn't very old; like Miss Hanover, he looked like he'd just gotten out of college. Everything about him gave off an air of precision: his neatly combed hair, his crisp white shirt, his pressed and pleated slacks, and his tie, which somehow seemed to stay perfectly flat against his front, even when his movements should have made it flap. I didn't know his name, but I didn't think he'd be very happy about me being here so late, so I tried to quickly steal inside and hide in a dark corner next to the door.

Unfortunately, I wasn't quick enough, and the teacher saw me. "Oh, hello," he said. "I was just about to lock up. Did you need something?"

Caught, I came forward into the light. I knew my only chance was to lie. I've always been a terrible liar, though, so it was a slim chance. But I tried anyway. "Um, I just forgot something in my clubroom," I said. "I came back to get it."

"Oh, okay. Do you want me to walk up with you? Then I can lock up afterwards. Mrs. Henderson—" She was the secretary who oversaw the front office. "—will have my skin if I forget." He held up a shiny brass key, which must have been the key to the two tall white doors I had just come through.

"Um, that's all right. I-I can get it by myself. Um, just go ahead and lock up. I'll find my own way out."

Anyone with eyes could see I was carrying a blanket and pillow, and anyone with a brain could work out that I didn't need those things to get something I'd forgotten in the clubroom. Also, unless I was a magician (which I wasn't), there was no way I could just find my own way out of a locked building. So it was a pretty weak lie, like most of mine. And this teacher I didn't know was looking at me with suspicion, like he thought I was lying, which I was. I wanted to sink back into the corner and become a potted plant, like the one behind the reception desk, just so I didn't have to see him staring at me.

"You're Lily van Rossum, aren't you?" the teacher asked.

"Y-yes...How did you know?"

"Miss Hanover told me that you're the president of some sort of volunteer club...the Helping Hands?"

I ventured a little bit further out of the corner, a little bit closer to the teacher. "That's right," I said. This seemed like a weird thing to be talking about if he were going to yell at me and put me in detention, so I thought he probably wasn't. "We like using our unique gifts to help people. Of course, we'll help anyone who needs it. We helped Ms. Rutherford clear the old PE sheds, and we helped Mrs. Julian on the Geology Club camping trip, and two of our members, Nora and Cora, helped the student council get rid of a stray dog that was causing trouble."

"Are any of your members good at puzzles?" the teacher asked.

I certainly wasn't, and I couldn't see Cora being any good at them. Nora and Ranta might be okay, but I didn't think either of them were secret masters of puzzles. "I don't think so," I said.

"Well, I guess it doesn't matter that much if they're good or not...Listen, I'm Daniel Wardlaw. I'm the faculty supervisor for the Puzzle Club." He held out his hand. I came forward, completely out of the dark corner, and shook it, finally convinced he wasn't going to yell at me. "We're holding a Puzzle Contest for the elementary school this weekend, but...we're short on people. Only the members of the Puzzle Club have signed up to compete so far. We were really hoping to have a strong challenger, or at least some people good enough to recruit to the club."

"You want me to enter my members?" I asked. "But, Mr. Wardlaw, I've just told you, I don't think any of them are good at puzzles..."

"That's okay. If people from outside the club enter, maybe it'll get more people from outside to enter. At worst, we'll have a few fillers for the early rounds before our people have to face each other. Besides," Mr. Wardlaw added with a smile, "if you do this this for me, I could let you go up to your clubroom and get whatever you forgot, while I lock up and let you find your own way out."

I felt a chill up my spine. He tricked me.

"I'll do it," I agreed.

"Good. By the way, Miss van Rossum, I don't know why you're sleeping in your clubroom, but if it's anything I can help you with, please let me know. Miss Hanover tells me you're a good girl and a good student, so I trust you have your reasons." He went for the door, and flashed me a smile on his way out, his straight, white teeth shining gold in the light of the dying sun. "Well, I'll just lock things up. Good night."

"Ah...Yes, sir."

Ah, he was really handsome when he smiled.

When I got up to the clubroom, I had a little trouble finding somewhere to sleep. I had first bedded down on the window seat. I knew Nora slept there sometimes, and I had liked being able to see the stars and the distant lights of the high school buildings across the campus. But the cold, damp drafts of air coming off the glass had eventually driven me to the sofa in the corner. 

I had meant to wake up early the next day, but the sofa was so comfortable that I overslept; when I woke up, I could already hear teachers talking in the corridors outside the clubroom. I got up and hid my blanket and pillow in one of the cupboards. Now that tests were over and homework was starting to pick up again, it was possible I'd be able to sleep in my room tonight. But if I couldn't, I'd be sure to get in here earlier, so I wouldn't have another close call like yesterday.

I took a hairbrush from my satchel and, looking at my reflection in the big window, did my best to tame my hair. Rather than tie it into a long braid like I usually did, I just tied it back into a ponytail with a rubber band. I put on the spare pair of socks I always carried in my satchel (in case I got my feet wet watering something), then put my overalls and boots back on.

That done, I went out into the corridor. While it was unusual for a student to be in the office building early in the morning, it wasn't unheard of, so when I passed by a pair of older women chatting in the hall, they didn't give me a second look.

Rather than going out by the main doors, which might make Mrs. Henderson suspect something, I went up the hall towards the teachers' lounge, where there was a staircase I could take down to the back exit. I passed out into the courtyard and headed for the dining hall.


When I got inside, I saw that Nora and Ranta were sitting together at a table in the far corner. Nora had her back to me, but Ranta noticed me come in and waved, and Nora turned and waved too. I waved back, smiling as best as I could. I didn't go over to them right away, though; instead, I got in line for some scrambled eggs, pancakes, and fruit salad. I felt myself moving slowly on purpose, trying to put off the time I would have to tell them that we were entering a puzzle contest.  In the past I had always let them choose whether they wanted to help me on a job or not. Now, I couldn't afford to give them that choice, but I also couldn't tell them what was really going on. It was making me nervous.

Finally, though, I couldn't take any more time choosing my breakfast. I then went over to them, hoping they would be willing to help me.

"Good morning, Lily," said Nora as I sat down next to her. A battered book called *The World's Last Night*, by C.S. Lewis, lay on the table in front of her. She must have been reading it when Ranta found her.

"Morning," I said.

"Looks like you left in a hurry," said Ranta. "Were you in the garden?"

"Yes," I lied. "The calamomile is in bloom right now, and I wanted to make sure it didn't cross-pollinate the chamorose, so I was doing some pruning."

Ranta seemed to believe me, but Nora wore a troubled expression. While I ate my breakfast, Nora and Ranta went back to discussing books. Nora and Ranta are very different: Ranta is mature, calm under pressure, and outgoing, while Nora is shy and gets flustered easily. But they both like long, hard, dense books, books whose ideas I couldn't even begin to understand. From what they were saying, I understood that Ranta had let Nora borrow *The World's Last Night*, and that it was full of strange, difficult ideas about religion.

I was just finishing with my pancakes and getting into tea and fruit salad when Nora turned to me, squirming a little, and said, "Um, Lily? I notice you haven't braided your hair."

"Yeah, I didn't really have time," I said. I kept my face on my fruit salad, hoping it wouldn't give me away.

"Well, if it's all right, would you like me to do it for you? Um, I used to braid my sister's hair sometimes, so I'm not bad at it."

Surprised and touched, I smiled. "I'd love that," I said. "But I've got a lot of hair, so don't worry about giving up if you get tired in the middle, okay?"

"I won't," said Nora.

I drank my tea without moving my head too much while Nora braided my hair and continued her conversation with Ranta. Partway through, Cora showed up, carrying her breakfast tray.

It looked like I wasn't the only one who hadn't had time to do her hair properly this morning. Cora's hair was still black from when her brother had dyed it, and she hadn't tied it into her usual twin ponytails. It was hanging loose, so full of knots that it looked like a patch of blackberry bramble which had overgrown a tangle of kudzu, which had then become the nesting site for several families of birds. Her eyes had a heavy, sleepless look to them, which didn't really make sense to me, since she would have had to sleep on her hair to get it that messy.

"Um...Good morning, Cora," said Nora uncertainly as Cora sat down next to Ranta.

"Morning." She shot Nora a venomous scowl, making Nora flinch a little, then forced her face into a smile as she turned to me. "Lily, can I please do your hair next time?"

"Try doing your own hair first," said Ranta.

They fought for about five minutes after that, but I ignored them, as I always did when they started fighting, and focused on my tea and the pleasant feeling of Nora's small, soft hands in my hair.

After Cora and Ranta had finished fighting, I decided I'd better tell them about the job. Hoping they'd all agree to help me, I opened my mouth.

I forgot that I had tea in my mouth.

The tea went down my windpipe, and I coughed for about a minute. Nora patted me on the back to help it go down, and I opened my mouth again.

"Do any of you know Mr. Wardlaw?" I said.

"Wardlaw? Isn't he that nutjob—" Cora began.

"The one who gave the assembly where he tried to teach us calculus?" Ranta said. She nodded. "I know him. Half of my class hates him, and the other half have crushes on him because he's handsome, but none of them understood a single word he said during that assembly."

"I still have nightmares about it sometimes," Nora sighed. "Where I'm being chased by those upside-down triangles and backwards sixes he kept writing on the board."

This didn't look good for me. They already knew him as a lunatic. But I had to ask anyway. "Mr. Wardlaw is the head of the Puzzle Club," I said. "He needs more people to enter the puzzle contest this weekend. He asked if  you could all enter." I looked around at the abject terror on all of their faces, and quickly added, "Just so there's someone from outside the club. I can't enter, since middle schoolers aren't allowed."

"If the puzzles are anything like that assembly, you've got to be way past middle school to solve them," said Ranta. "More like fourth year of college. Not just any college, either. Some math nerd school, like MIT. Sorry, Lily, but I don't think my nerves can take it."

My heart sank. I looked around at Cora and Nora, hoping for a volunteer. They both looked uncertain. I had to do something to get them in. It made me feel bad to take advantage of my friends like this, but I didn't know what else to do; after all, I did owe Mr. Wardlaw one for last night. 

I took a deep breath. "The truth is, I really need your help. I...got in trouble with Mr. Wardlaw last night.  He told me he wouldn't punish me if I could get some more people to enter the contest. I'm sorry, I don't like asking like this...that's why I didn't say anything at first...but I do need your help. I'll owe all of you an ice cream if you'll do it."

The three of them exchanged a look. Nora was the first to speak. "Um, if you really need my help, then of course I'll help you," she said. "After all, it can't be worse than the hornet shed, or the dog, right?" she added, looking around at the others.

"The dog was only bad because you're a flailer," said Cora. "But you're right. If it's to help Lily, I'm in."

"Me too," said Ranta. "You should've told us you needed our help in the first place, Lily. Of course I'll help."

It made me happy that they all agreed to help me, and I was also glad that they hadn't insisted on knowing how I'd gotten in trouble. I did wish I could've told them how nice Mr. Wardlaw actually was, though.

<br />

The weekend came, and with it, the puzzle contest.
