* A Whirlwind of Far too Early, Unfair First Impressions of Shows that I watched the First Episode of At Some Point in Time, begun Friday, September 16th, 2011:

This will be a list of shows of which I've only seen the first episode, or possibly even part of an episode. They are listed in more or less chronological order according to when I watched them. There are various reasons why I only watched a few episodes; mostly it was because the show didn't grab me, but sometimes I was in the middle of a super-heavyweight show (Aria intersects with a lot of the earlier ones, and Bakemonogatari and K-On intersected early looks at Yuru Yuri) and I didn't feel like diverting. Since one episode (or in one case, five) is too few to fairly judge most series, these opinions are tentative and subject to change.

Recently there's been a trend toward posting preliminary impressions in here and expanding into fuller reports after seeing more episodes.

Even more recently, I've been writing about series that I don't have much to say about in here.

*** Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun
Chiyo Sakura screws up her confession to tall and taciturn Nozaki-kun and ends up with his autograph and a job as his manga assistant. It turns out Nozaki is a well-known shoujo manga artist. Chiyo takes the job as his assistant so she can be close to him, and ends up being pretty good at it due to her time in the art club. Nozaki says he's been watching her for a while (because he wanted her talent in art). Chiyo ends up telling Nozaki that there was a guy she liked because he was tall and manly, but he didn't notice her confession, but now they get to spend time together and she's getting to know him better, and Nozaki unwittingly insults himself by asking what's so great about a guy like that.

At the end of Episode 1, Nozaki introduces Chiyo to his other assistant, Mikoshiba, who he describes as an "iyashikei" type. That turns out to be mostly wrong; Mikoshiba is a gaudy playboy with red hair, an earring, and a tendency to spout cheesy "handsome guy" shoujo manga lines like "Let's play, my little lambs". But he immediately gets embarrassed as soon as he hears himself, which Nozaki finds cute and soothing. Mikoshiba makes a big deal about being Chiyo's sempai at manga assistantship and tells her that if she doesn't know how to do something, don't bother asking him, but then he moons around the apartment until Nozaki tells Chiyo that he really wants her to ask him something, and Chiyo fakes ignorance and asks him. Mikoshiba delightedly and somewhat condescendingly explains it to her.

Mikoshiba is actually pretty lousy at drawing, but he's good at doing those extravagant rose and sparkle background effects that are common in shoujo manga. Chiyo and Nozaki notice how the hero becomes really annoying if they let Mikoshiba work on too many of the panels. Chiyo asks how Nozaki and Mikoshiba became friends, since they're so different, and Nozaki says he initially wanted to base a manga character on Mikoshiba, but later they became friends. Chiyo searches an issue for the character based on Mikoshiba, and Nozaki tells her it's the heroine. Chiyo observes that his personality is perfect for a heroine.

Nozaki says he wants to introduce a new character and needs some material. Chiyo introduces him to her friend, Yuzuki Seo, who's selfish, says whatever pops into her mind, and is a bigtime victim of the Dunning-Kruger Effect in that she believes herself to be tactful and considerate. When she meets Nozaki, she asks why he's hanging out with Chiyo and then assumes he must be a lolicon. When another friend comes to show off her bag, Seo says the tacky old guy next door had the same bag. The basketball club invites her to assist because she's so selfish on the court that it reminds everyone of the importance of teamwork, and the teachers are constantly chasing her over some transgression or other. But, as it turns out, she has an amazing soprano voice. Chiyo thinks the character based on Seo is going to be a heroine with an amazing voice, but then she sees that it's the hero, who interrupts the heroine's attempt to give him vital information by asking if this is going to take long, because he has to go to the bathroom. The heroine thinks how she wants to punch him in the face. 

I enjoyed the first two episodes of Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun. It feels a lot like Working!!, but with shoujo manga instead of a family restaurant. Both episodes were full of good jokes and amusing yet interesting characters. Chiyo is super cute. I liked how both guys are parodies of common character types in shoujo—Nozaki is the deadpan, dark-haired, taciturn guy with a secret burning passion, except his secret burning passion is manga. Mikoshiba is the gaudy playboy type, except he seems insecure and can't get out those cheesy lines without noticing immediately how cheesy they are. (Chiyo has a great look of disgust that she shoots him whenever he says one, making Mikoshiba beg her to stop staring and say something to break the tension.) Nozaki is voiced by Yuichi Nakamura, who does a good job in a non-harem hero role. (He also played such a role in Inu x Boku SS; he does have a deep, manly voice that suits him for that sort of shoujo hero role.) Seo is voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro, which just makes her similarities with Kanbaru Suruga even more apparent.

[<2015-03-07 Sat>] The next few episodes introduce more parodies of common shoujo characters—there's the boyish looking girl Kashima, known as the Prince of the school, who seduces all the girls of the theater club with cheesy lines that Mikorin can't get out with a straight face; there's Hori, the theater club president, a responsible and upright fellow who beats Kashima and also does the backgrounds on Nozaki's manga; and Wakamatsu, the bumbling keet-type. Kashima and Hori are sort of like Ayame and Hatori in Fruits Basket, except that Hatori's personality type was more like Nozaki, while Hori is responsible and hardworking, but has no problem getting violent with Kashima. I didn't really like Kashima—most of the jokes involving her are too obvious—but I did like Hori, and I liked how he and Chiyo hit it off after Chiyo spent a day worrying whether he was a girl who was spending late nights alone with Nozaki, while thinking that couldn't be the case, all based on the signs he used to mark which parts of the background she should shade in. (He used a cute kitty on one, which made Chiyo think he was a girl, but then drew a pair of men's briefs, which made her think he couldn't be.) I also liked Wakamatsu, a member of the basketball team who is tormented by Seo during games. He's so stressed out thinking about her that he can't sleep, until he gets a copy of her singing voice from Nozaki (Chiyo brought it over, and Nozaki was only too happy to rid himself of it). It's implied that Seo has a crush on him and bullies him because of that. After a couple sleeper episodes revolving around Kashima, Wakamatsu’s introduction was a nice surprise.

I kind of wish we'd get another episode focusing on Chiyo and Nozaki's relationship, but otherwise I'm pretty satisfied with this series. It's a lot of fun. Apparently I read more shoujo than I realized, since I understood most of the parodies. (I went through a period where I read quite a bit of shoujo manga—mostly CLAMP and Yuu Watase—but I've also read and watched a lot of "covert" shoujo, stuff like Working and Mahoutsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto that, while shounen, spices things up with some shoujo tropes too.)

*** Nagi no Asu kara
This isn’t from the queue; I was so underwhelmed that I didn’t want to continue with any of those, so I set off looking for something else and found this. It’s from PA Works and Mari Okada, the studio and writer that did Hanasaku Iroha, but where Hanasaku Iroha had a soap opera domestic drama kind of feeling to it, Nagi Asu feels more like Ano Hana: somewhat of a blend of Key and Honey and Clover.

The setting is kind of strange: there’s a village on the bottom of the ocean where all the physical laws work exactly like on the surface even though they’re under water, kind of like in Spongebob Squarepants. The village seems to be small and dying out, and when it shuts down its middle school, four students have to attend school on the surface: Hikari, Manaka, Chisaki, and Kaname. Manaka is a crybaby, while Hikari is a hot and passionate young man and Chisaki is soft-spoken and a peacemaker, leading people to say that Hikari is Manaka’s father and Chisaki is her mother (according to Chisaki). Kaname is just a random effeminate guy.

On the first day of school, Manaka gets caught in a fishing net and pulled up by Tsumugu Kihara, a boy at their school. She seems to fall in love with him at first sight, but she also gets a crush on him because he later rescues her from drying out and losing her shiny membrane that lets her live underwater, her ena, when she gets lost in the forest after running from Hikari. Tsumugu also gains her trust because he doesn’t laugh at the ugly burping fish which fused into her knee after she angered the living god of the underwater village by slapping him for saying perverted things. Tsumugu later volunteers to help do a version of a special ceremony that they do underwater to honor the sea god, and build a doll that represents a virgin who was sacrificed in the original version of the ceremony.

I think I can already see where the emotional train wreck is going to come up. Hikari likes Manaka. Manaka likes Tsumugu. Chisaki likes Hikari. Kaname likes Chisaki. Big mess. We also find out that the underwater village is filled with angry old guys who sit around trashing the surface people all day, and they made a law that anyone who dates a surface dweller can never come back. This comes up because Hikari’s older sister Akari is dating a surface dweller; at the end of Episode 2, the old guys find out and drag her up in chains. Since Manaka likes Tsumugu, a surface dweller, drama will ensue.

Finding out this was from the HanaIro team was actually kind of a letdown, because HanaIro started with interesting character development and cute situations, but it degraded into boring situational drama and also failed because its major male characters, Kou and Toru, were so underwritten. (I couldn’t stand Toru. Also, that song he liked that goes “Let’s party” was stupid, no matter what Ohana’s mother thought.) But I’ll watch a little more, because I liked the first two episodes a lot, especially the visuals and the restrained, quiet air around major scenes. Hikari comes off as kind of a jerk, but I think he’s supposed to. Also, Manaka is played by KANA HANAZAWA, and Chisaki is played by Ai Kayano (Menma).

Some results from the Queue.
*** Tantei Opera Milky Holmes
Sort of a weird older magical girl show (except despite its appearance, it’s from 2010) with a detective theme. It’s about a team of four magical girl detectives known as Milky Holmes who are the stars of their school, the Magical Detective Academy Thingy. They’re all themed after classical literary detectives: Sherlock “Sheryl” Sherringford (Sherlock Holmes; a lot of places have her last name as “Shellingford”, but it’s clearly a reference to Sherlock Holmes’s original first name before Conan Doyle wrote the first story); Nero Yuzurizaki (Nero Wolfe, a detective created by author Rex Stout who weighs 300 pounds and solves mysteries from his armchair); Hercule “Elly” Barton (Hercule Poirot; the name “Elly” comes from the Japonized pronunciation “Erukyuru” of “Hercule”) and Cordelia Glauca (Cordelia Gray, a young female detective created by author P.D. James). They battle the Gentleman Thieves, based on famous thieves, headed by Arsene, who, in magical girl tradition, has both a secret child form (in which form she is the student council president, Henriette) and a cleavage form. 

Interestingly, the series starts with the characters losing their special powers (Toys) and so their privileged position at the academy. Arsene humiliates them in front of everyone by exposing their lack of power in front of everyone, but then tells them they have three months to regain their powers. She shoves them in a dusty attic with one bed and then goes off with her thieves to wreak havoc.

I can’t say I have high hopes for this series, but on the other hand, the humor was actually pretty good; one of the thieves, who is in disguise as a teacher, is obsessed with how beautiful he is and constantly takes off his shirt. In one scene, the Milky Holmes girls are wet because they fell in the lake due to Sheryl’s clumsiness. He throws his shirt to them to cover themselves, but they decide to just go change, and his shirt gets chewed up by dogs. The opening scene, where the girls are all sleeping fitfully through their alarm clocks, and the ending scene, where four of them sleep in a single double bed with feet in faces, were both really cute. Unfortunately, the animation is not so good; it looks pretty early 2000s. It’s about at the level of Gakuen Alice. But the character designs for the girls are cute, although the guys are pretty generic and uninteresting.

If I keep watching this, I’d want to really see some character-focused stories, but I don’t know if I would. The girls are cute enough, but their personalities are pretty archetypal—Sheryl is the clumsy, cheerful one; Nero is the tomboyish one; Elly is the shy one; Cordelia is the rich one—and I don’t know if I can expect the show to ever rise beyond that.
*** Love Live!
Honoka discovers that her high school, which was also attended by her mother and grandmother, is closing down due to low enrollment . She wants to do something to save it and hits upon the idea of having an idol group that can attract new students after seeing other schools doing similar things. She convinces her friends to join her, even though the student council president, following the lead of the school’s director, says she won’t approve an Idol Club with that purpose.

It looks like this is going to be similar to Hanayamata, with maybe a little more K-On-ness. It had some cute scenes, but frankly, I was more impressed with Hanayamata after the first few episodes than I was with this; the Hanayamata characters were cuter and more unique. Plus, I just don’t really like idols. This kind of thing is innocuous enough, but living in the US, my mental image has been too tainted by things like the Miley Cyrus disaster to enjoy idols, who are too close to the Japanese version of Miley Cyrus. Also, I don’t really like idol music; it has this clangy jingly repetitive techno dance hall thing going that I don’t dig. The opening and ending are more like regular anime music, so that’s good, but the song that Honoka sees the idols from the other school perform is more idolatrous and thus disfavored. Also, I read a review (which said this was really good and convinced me to watch it in the first place) saying that we end up with nine characters, which to me is just too many. Hanayamata barely got by with five. Negima managed to get along with tons of characters, but it was a hugely long manga series, and only about seven of the thirty-one girls were actually major characters, with the others separated into various tiers of importance (ranging from the “in the thick of things, but not at the forefront” Konoka and Kaede, to the “appears once every two volumes” Evangeline, to the “I forgot they existed” Narutaki twins and Satsuki).

I might give the second episode a chance, but maybe not. I actually enjoyed Milky Holmes more, even though this had better animation and was less cheesy. (I didn’t like the CG dancing sequences, though. It’s way too jarring to switch from 2D to 3D and back like that. They got away with it in K-On because it was so fast you could barely tell, but here they’ll just switch from 2D animation to a 3D dance sequence like the FMVs in old Final Fantasy games.)
*** Jinrui wa Suitaishimashita (Humanity has Declined)
This show was a lot more unique than Love Live or Milky Holmes. It takes place in a world where human civilization has somehow been drastically set back, and the population is so low that the narrator believes humanity will go extinct. Everyone lives in dumpy little farming towns. A new species called Fairies (/yousei/ in Japanese) has arisen; they’re about six inches tall, but they apparently have super technology. The narrator is an unnamed girl who was appointed UN Mediator and Liaison to the Fairies. Several fairies stay at her house, and it’s her job to keep them fed and happy and also to solve various problems in the town. 

Mostly the series gets by on being weird and unique. The art style is interesting, very bright and pastel-colored, and there are cute girls, although only the narrator is really important among them. I think it’s an interesting series, but it’s not really what I’m in the mood for right now; I was hoping for something more character-based and maybe a little ecchi. It was probably the best of the three I’ve tried from the queue, though. Maybe I will keep watching it and see if I can get in the mood for it.
*** Asobi ni Iku yo!
This is not from the queue; I bought the DVD set since it was only $12. It was retitled to “Cat Planet Cuties” for the American release, which is unfortunate. (I don’t think I have to explain why.) 

Cat-eared alien Eris lands on Earth one day after sending the authorities a message that says “asobi ni iku yo” (meaning “I’m coming over”). She ends up living with a normal guy named Kio Kakazu who reminds me a bit of Riki from Little Busters. It turns out that everyone Kio knows is a member of some secret organization with an interest in the aliens. His teacher is part of some weird cult that wants to make sure first contact with aliens goes just as they want; his childhood friend Manami Kinjou is a junior member of the CIA; and his school friend Aoi Futaba, who has a crush on him, is an assassin in powered armor working for the Japanese government. Even his uncle Yuichi, who looks like a 1970s porn star, is involved somehow.

The US government captures Eris (remember, big US military presence in Okinawa, which also explains Manami’s affiliation with the CIA), but Kio and his friends rescue her. This puts Manami and Aoi on the shit list with their employers, but Eris’s people arrive and set up Kio’s house as the embassy for their planet, Catia, which means that as long as Manami and Aoi live there, they’re technically not just in another country, but on another planet, and so cannot be harmed. It turns out the US already had secret dealings with Catia’s enemy, Dogishua, who of course have dog ears, so they work behind the scenes to take out Eris and stop Japan from establishing relations with Catia.

So far this is actually really good. It’s kind of like To-Love-Ru crossed with Read or Die. I like how it doesn’t ignore real-world things like government relations and embassies that would come up if aliens arrived on Earth, despite its otherwise silly premise. Their excuse for getting all these girls and this one guy in a house together was the most clever I’ve seen. It was pretty funny to see them start with a cliched harem premise where this cute alien girl shows up and all the main character’s earthly female acquaintances are shocked, then have them all turn out to be part of secret alien-catching organizations.

The show also has an all-star voice cast. Eris is voiced by Kanae Ito, Manami is voiced by Haruka Tomatsu, and Aoi is voiced by KANA HANAZAWA (I figured at this point I should upcase her name like TV Tropes does with Brian Blessed). Among the other Catians are two voiced by Kikuko Inoue and Aki Toyosaki, and someone (I’ve not yet figured out who) is voiced by Yui Horie. The art and animation aren’t special, but they’re high quality, and the show uses a unique dark shading that makes it look more serious than the bright lighting used by To-Love-Ru or OniAi. The character designs are interesting and distinctive, and the use of gestures and body language is good, especially with Eris, whose facial expressions are quite adorable.

So far, Aoi is my favorite. It’s not just Hanazawa, but also her cute appearance and how cool she looks in her Bubblegum Crisis-like powered armor. I also liked how she chose not to wallow in self-pity when she discussed her past, even though it is pretty pitiable. Eris is also good; she’s a bit like Lala, but not quite as ditzy. Her facial expressions and the way she moves her ears and tail are adorable, and Kanae Ito’s voice really plays up her cute side, despite her sexy body. I don’t like Manami all that much; she’s a tsundere childhood friend, and although she claims to be over her feelings for Kio, I suspect that won’t turn out to be true. But I do like Manami’s friendship with Aoi.

It’s a good show so far; weirdly, the things it’s weakest on are humor and ecchi. It’s had a few ecchi scenes, but they never go nearly as far as To-Love-Ru, and it’s had a few jokes, but they were mostly spice and chuckle-worthy rather than hilarous. Although the various cults are pretty funny. (A later cult is run by a rich girl obsessed with cat ears, who regards Eris as a divine being since she has real cat ears.) I’m up to Episode 6, and although the plot can occasionally be muddled, it’s overall pretty skillful, and everything basically makes sense, and the characters are likable and believable and not annoying or totally cliched.
**** <2014-12-28 Sun>
I’m pretty close to the end of the series. Although it has yet to achieve its full potential, that’s mainly because the plot is too intricate for twelve episodes to really cover everything that’s going on. 

So far, one of my favorite scenes came during the obligatory beach episode. Manami has been hassling Aoi to move ahead with her love, and Aoi starts to get worried that Manami might be right that Eris is going to swoop in and take him. That night, as everyone enjoys barbecued meat and corn, Kio asks Aoi to come talk to him in private. Aoi is elated, thinking Kio is going to confess to her, but he actually asks her to teach him how to fight, since he feels he hasn’t been pulling his weight during the recent incidents.

Poor Aoi is devastated, but hides it until Kio leaves. The next person to find her is Eris, who’s come to offer her some meat. Aoi gets angry and yells at Eris, saying “If you weren’t here—!” and pounding against Eris’s chest. Eris hugs her and says she knows how important Kio is to Aoi. I thought it was nice how sweet Eris was. The scene loses a little power after you know that Catian males are extremely rare, so Catians have polygamy; to Eris, she’s not comforting a rival, but rather a future co-wife. 

I also like how Manami, rather than secretly loving Kio the whole time, was in love with him at one point but thought she had lost her chance and gotten over her feelings. She realizes that she might still be in love with him as she does her best to help Aoi win him over from Eris.

If there’s a weakness, it’s probably the villains, the Dogishuans. (Wikipedia says “Dogisians”.) The Dogishuan agent, Janes, is the one played by Yui Horie. Her dog Assistaroid, Matrey, is based on 1970s cartoon character Muttley. (The names are similar; Matrey has a weird robot version of Muttley’s hoarse laugh.) Otherwise she’s not very well defined as a character, and much about the Dogishuans remains mysterious, including their motives. They’ve been supplying Earth with technology, which they’re not supposed to be doing since they’re under an embargo by an advanced race called the Orzonians that police interplanetary relations, but it’s not clear why or what it buys them. They do have considerable power on Earth; when Antonia (the cat ear cult leader) tries to buy a rocket to complete a plan to foil the Dogishuans’ attempt to make the Catia ship self-destruct, Janes is able to block every government from selling her one, forcing her to buy an old Russian missile with the warhead removed.

I doubt there will be a second season, but I do think the show could have benefited from one.

**** <2015-01-06 Tue>
I finished watching the series. Everything was good except for one episode about the original Assistoroid, Lawry, coming to visit Earth. Her visit makes Eris feel basically white guilt over the way her people treated Assistoroids in the past, and while it was a potentially interesting story, it was not very well executed. 

The final story arc was pretty interesting. Kio, Eris, Aoi, and Manami have to rescue the Catian ship from vaporizing after the Dogishuans seal up the crew and set the ship on a collision course with Earth. If the ship actually hit Earth, it would destroy all life, but it has safety mechanisms to self-destruct first. Captain Qoone is disabled and gives her command bell to Kio, who ends up having to modify his own DNA to become Catian so he can give the ship commands. All three girls also confess their love to Kio by kissing him before they go out to fight Janes and buy Kio some time to get on the ship.

There’s also an OVA, which is all about jokes and fan service, and not only was it funny and sexy, it also proved that Asobi ni Iku yo does know how to produce a good fan service and humor episode, it just chose not too before now, because there was too much story to get through. The OVA concerns the main three girls and Kio, along with Antonia and her maids and Kio’s schoolmate Ichika, who is a secret Catian, having a gaming contest. They play for various prizes, including an embarrassing DVD of Kio that Eris shot when she helped make a movie, and an embarrassing DVD of Aoi and Manami that they shot when they needed a speedboat to infiltrate Antonia’s ship. Meanwhile, the Catian crew tries out some games, but mistakenly plays the strip versions of everything. Even Janes plays a game of chess against Matrey and strips when she loses.

It’s not really what I was looking for, so I didn’t appreciate it as much as I might have, but Asobi ni Iku yo was definitely a cut above the average harem show in its animation, all-star cast (Minako Kotobuki plays Chayka, a Catian bridge officer and Aki Toyosaki plays Melwin, the first officer; if they could have gotten Yoko Hikasa, Satomi Sato, and Ayana Taketatsu to play Catian officers, they could have had Catian Houkago Tea Time), and especially its writing.

*** Ebiten
Kind of like Excel Saga crossed with Haruhi Suzumiya, only not as good as either of them. I watched it because I wanted to see something fun and ecchi after the boring drama of Little Busters: Refrain and the last few episodes of Hanayamata, but it was pretty disappointing. It had a few good jokes, but none were more than chuckle-worthy.

The main characters are all part of the Astronomy Club, except it’s really the Sit Around and Do Crazy Stuff All the Time Club. The only character I really liked was Hakata Kanamori, because she’s sexy and gets naked all the time after the president, Todayama Kyouko, strips her. Also, she’s a fujoshi, and in one scene she gets sexually aroused thinking about how she’ll be gang-raped now that Kyouko dragged her around the school in a sexy Santa outfit.

Every episode contains a parody of some anime. The first episode was Saint Seiya and the second episode was Sailor Moon. Unfortunately, this didn’t do much for me, because I never watched more than a few episodes of Saint Seiya, so most of the jokes were lost on me, and the Sailor Moon parody wasn’t very good because it was mostly just on the level of visual reference and never made any attempt to actually mock the show, other than one scene which was one of its few good jokes, where they made fun of how Tuxedo Mask always appears, throws in a rose, says some crap, and does nothing, and yet his appearance is regarded as a major turning point in the battle. (Another good joke was when the ojousama character, Ooba, plays Athena during the Saint Seiya parody and explains how the script says she’ll die if they don’t find the gold cloth. She “passes out”, then whispers “The script says I’ll die if you don’t find it.” It’s not very funny on paper, but the timing made it funny in the actual show.) Later on they do K-On and Dragon Ball parodies, so I wonder if those would work better for me. But I’m not going to find out, because I don’t feel like watching any more of this. 

They should have just made a show about Kanamori being a sexy and naked otaku. I would have watched that.

*** Yoku Wakaru Gendai Mahou
I haven’t actually watched this yet, so it’s a really unfair first impression. But they combined magical girls with programming, and the episodes have titles like “Hello world” (Episode 1) and “Open Death and Destruction” (like all those programs that have “open” in the name, like “OpenSSL” and “OpenGL”), “Dragon Book” (aka /Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools/, by Aho, Sethi, and Ullman,  which I am actually reading right now), and “TIMTOWTDI” (“There is more than one way to do it”, the Perl motto). So that’s pretty cool. Thus, I think I might watch it.

*** The Queue
No, that’s not a show. This is a list of shows I want to check out right now. I’m sick of committing to a show only to be disappointed, so I’m going to do one or two episodes of a bunch of them and also keep following Unlimited Blade Works.
    
  - Yoku Wakaru Gendai Mahou
  - Tantei Opera Milky Holmes
  - Love Live! School Idol Project
  - Hyouka
  - Humanity has Declined

And here are some that I gave a chance before, but I’m interested in giving a second chance:

  - Hyouka
  - Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai
  - Sunday Without God
  - Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou (read the manga)
  - Puella Magi Madoka Magica (read the manga)
  - Kyoukai no Kanata

*** Hanamaru Kindergarten
Today I watched two shows that starts with /hana/. The first was Hanamaru Kindergarten. The second was Hanayamata, which gets its own file since I expect to be watching it for a while. 

Hanamaru Kindergarten is about a lazy guy named Tsuchida on his first day as the only male kindergarten teacher in the neighborhood. He stops and talks to one of his students, Anzu, when he sees her on the side of the road by herself, leading Anzu to think that he's trying to pick her up. (She's like five years old, so all her knowledge of pickups is based on TV.) Anzu later makes trouble at the opening ceremony when she says out loud that Tsuchida hit on her. To the show's credit, it doesn't seem like anyone really believes that, but Tsuchida is thrown off enough to start jabbering and announce in front of all the students and teachers and parents that he likes big boobs, causing the parents' doubts about him (spurred by their general doubts about male kindergarten teachers) to increase. The children, on the other hand, find him highly amusing.

Anzu befriends two other girls, Hiiragi and Koume, and ends up climbing a tree to go after Koume's ribbon. She almost falls on her head, but she's caught by Tsuchida as her mother and the hot female teacher Yamamoto look on. It turns out Anzu's mother is Tsuchida's sempai from high school, who dropped out to marry their art teacher and have a child.

Hearing her mother's story about marrying her father while he was her art teacher, Anzu decides she's going to be Tsuchida's bride. Her mother encourages this, telling Tsuchida it's a mere ten years between them. (It's totally not ten years, let alone “a mere” ten years. Tsuchida is at least twenty-two since he graduated from college, and Anzu is about five since she's in kindergarten, so it's more like seventeen years.) Tsuchida, showing that he is totally not like Aoki from Kodomo no Jikan, is not happy about the fact that her mother is encouraging her.

It was cute and fun enough, but I decided to switch over to Hanayamata. I appreciated that there is no sexual element to Anzu's precociousness, that we can clearly see that her mother contributed to her being like that, and that Tsuchida is definitely not interested. (He'd have to be pretty desperate; the girls in this show are sort of potato-shaped and look like a cross between a baby and Hello Kitty. Which fits their age range. They are certainly not lolis at all. On the other hand, nothing wrong at all with that Yamamoto, and the other female teachers are also quite good-looking.) The animation looked outdated in a weird way---it reminded me of Card Captor Sakura: an older show with incredible animation for its time that still looks good today. Except the show is from 2010, so it shouldn't look like that. It's made by Gainax, which makes that extra weird. (Also, it's extra weird that Gainax made a show like this. I grew up with the image of Gainax as the makers of Eva, FLCL, and Mahoromatic, and Hanamaru Kindergarten is definitely not in the same genre as those.)

Moved into own file.

*** Hyouka
Houtarou Oreki's older sister convinces him to join her old high school club, the Classics Club, which is in danger of closing down. Houtarou is incredibly lazy and doesn't want to do anything ever, but he goes to join and finds that a rich, pretty girl named Chitanda Eru has joined. Chitanda doesn't let him leave, but instead makes him solve the mystery of how they were locked into the room when no one except Chitanda and the teachers have a key. Houtarou's friend Satoshi and his childhood nemesis except she probably has a crush on him also join and together they solve totally inconsequential mysteries like the mystery of the library book that gets checked out every week by a different girl even though it's really boring and even though the loan period is two weeks so it doesn't need to be checked out every week.

I like the art, the atmosphere, and Chitanda, but the story kind of fails to grab me. So far the stories have all been totally inconsequential like I mentioned. Chitanda is a pretty good character, though. She has an obsessive curiosity that leads her to take interest in these trivial things, and it turns out that Oreki is pretty good at figuring them out. It reminds me a bit of Bungaku Shoujo, as far as the setting and atmosphere, except so far without Bungaku Shoujo's sense of high melodrama or moe interludes. Things like Maki painting Touko naked, for example, don't happen in Hyouka, and it also loses the hyper-realistic melodrama that occurs in Famished Spirit (the whole weird modern day Wuthering Heights thing) or Corrupted Angel (the whole weird modern day Phantom of the Opera thing) or the entire backstory. On the other hand, even though it's more realistic than Bungaku Shoujo, it can be kind of difficult to slog through the stories because they are *soooo* inconsequential. I like Oreki a bit more than Konoha; Oreki has kind of a cool delinquent Sherlock Holmes air, where Konoha had sort of a fragile feeling, like Shinji Ikari without the Oedipus complex. But I like Touko a bit more than Chitanda, although I do think Chitanda is a good character. 

Chitanda and Oreki have an interesting dynamic. With most pairings like this, you have one detective character who has the drive and ability to solve mysteries, and another who would rather stay out of danger but puts themselves in harm's way out of concern for the detective. (E.g. Holmes and Watson, or in anime, we have Touko and Konoha, Haruhi and Kyon, Victorica and Kujo from Gosick.) On the other hand, in Hyouka, it's Chitanda who has the drive to solve mysteries, and Oreki who has the ability (Chitanda is far from stupid, but her mind just doesn't work like Oreki's.) Oreki's delivery when he solves a mystery is a lot like the narrator of Zaregoto, too.

So the series definitely has its good points, but the plots are just so dense and simultaneously boring that I'm having a hard time getting into it. Maybe it's better in anime form (I read the manga; I think this problem would be even worse if I were reading the original novels.)
*** Imasugu Oniichan ni Imouto da tte Iitai!
A gender-bending imouto love comedy! (That's the marketing blurb for the US release that I kind of want to happen and kind of not. No, forget it, it would be better if there was a US release.)

Rikuto is kind of a mama's boy, even though his mother has been dead for a while. When his father tells him he's getting remarried, Rikuto is initially opposed, but lightens up after he meets the new wife, Tsunoda Ryouko, and her son, Ayumu. The four of them start living together in Rikuto's small apartment, until construction on their new condo is done. Ayumu and Rikuto have to share a room and slowly adjust to being around each other. Rikuto wants to have a more distant relationship, like roommates, but Ayumu wants to be more like family and asks for permission to call Rikuto "Oniichan".

Meanwhile, Rikuto has been trying to chase down a girl he met when he went to the scoreboards for his high school entrance exam. He tells his friend Nanase Matsuri that he might have fallen in love with that girl at first sight. When he sees her again, she runs away, though. Rikuto hears from Ryouko that Ayumu is going to be attending his school dressed as a girl; on the first day of class, he discovers Ayumu is the girl from the exam scoring, and is sorely disappointed.

After many flirty events with Ayumu, Rikuto starts to worry that he might be gay for his little brother. Meanwhile, Ayumu really wants to tell him that she's actually a girl who disguised herself as a boy so it wouldn't be weird living in the same room with him. (That's where the title comes from; it means "I really want to tell Oniichan that I'm his little sister right now!") In the most recent chapter, Rikuto finds out by reading her diary accidentally. (He did see her naked before, and also saw her bra and how realistic her breasts were, but he deluded himself that it was some sort of makeup.) He decides they must have disguised Ayumu so she wouldn't feel weird living in the same room with him and figures he'll just keep playing dumb until they move into the bigger house. I think there has to be another reason, though. 

I like this series. The art is really cute and the characters are kind of unique, especially Matsuri. I like how the relationship between Rikuto and Ayumu is slowly building up, and how Rikuto and Ayumu constantly have different ideas about the direction they want to take it. (Rikuto at first just wants to be friends, while Ayumu wants to be siblings; later, Ayumu wants to have an oniichan, but it seems like Rikuto has romantic feelings for her.) Ayumu is a really great little sister character too, even though she's not blood-related and spends their first few weeks together as a little brother. She's a classic kind of little sister: she's not bitchy, she's not trying to sex up her brother, and she's neither a martial arts freak hero of justice nor is she an immortal phoenix yukata-loving nudist. She's just a cute, earnest girl who likes the idea of a cool oniichan to share a home and school life with, yet she avoids being boring or standard because of the weird situation and how her reaction to it is totally consistent with her personality. 

The scans are trickling out really slowly, so I wish there would be a US release. (At least the translation is decent, though. The translation of Ikoku Meiro no Croisée just keeps getting worse.)

*** Minami-ke
It reminds me a bit of Yotsuba&, and also a bit of Strawberry Marshmallow, although not as funny. The titular Minami family is made up of high school student Haruka, middle school student Kana, and elementary school student Chiaki. Haruka is hardworking, spacey, and skilled (also apparently she used to be a delinquent known as "Banchou", except many of the stories of her destruction were wrongly remembered; e.g. rather than breaking all the windows, she actually washed them all). Kana's silly and a little selfish, and Chiaki is smart, skilled, deadpan, and arrogant, going around calling everyone idiots. They have a useless uncle (cousin) Takeru who's supposed to be looking after them, but only comes by when he gets dumped, and a horde of friends whose names I can never remember, other than Fujioka, who likes Kana but is constantly the victim of her bizarre misapprehensions; Makoto, a boy in Chiaki's class who wants to come over but is never invited, causing Kana to dress him up as a girl and bring him over as one of her friends;  and Touma, a boyish girl whose last name is also Minami. 

It's not bad, but I'm wondering if the anime was way better or something, based on the amount of love it gets online. The art is kind of weird; it's really basic, but the characters are drawn quite realistically. Many of the stories don't really work for me, and I'm not sure whether to blame the translators or the original author. Some of them are pretty big homeruns, though, like when Haruka says Fujioka somehow reminds her of their father and Chiaki goes and sits on his lap. (It's not creepy; they're only like three years apart in age.) 
*** Oomuro-ke
Obviously a takeoff of Minami-ke, since it stars the members of the Oomuro family, who are the serious and skillful high school student Nadeshiko, silly and selfish middle school student Sakurako, and smart, deadpan youngest sister Hanako. It's a spinoff of Yuru Yuri, and while it's fun and I like it, I prefer both Yuru Yuri and Reset. As in Minami-ke, each girl has a horde of friends that I can never remember, but handily, Sakurako's friends are just the Yuru Yuri main cast, so I already know them. 

Probably my favorite story so far was when Sakurako went to win some animal pajamas for Hanako, but when she goes to give them, Hanako yells at her because her homework is going badly and she thinks Sakurako is just coming to bug her. (It comes after the Yuru Yuri story where Kyouko takes Sakurako to win them.) Nadeshiko resolves the misunderstanding.

*** Kyoukai no Kanata
An extremely unoriginal concept, an extremely skillful execution. The series is yet another "Spirit monsters that personify humans' negative emotions" deal, but it actually hid that from me for the first half of Episode 1 by doing a really interesting /in medias res/ setup instead of yet another "boy stumbles on spirit monster and is saved by cute girl with superpowers" setup.

Akihito Kanbara sees a girl on the roof of his school, looking as if she's about to jump off. He goes up and tells her a girl who looks that good in glasses shouldn't die, and in return, she stabs him with a magic sword made of her own blood. It turns out that Akihito is the spawn of a /youmu/ or "Dreamshade" and a human, which makes him immortal. The girl, Mirai Kuriyama, is a Spirit Hunter tasked with hunting the Dreamshades. She starts stalking Akihito and stabbing him every day, even though he can't die. (It still hurts, though, so he tries to avoid her.)

Akihito's friend and fellow literature club member Mitsuki comes from a shrine family of Spirit Hunters, and warns him not to get too involved with Mirai, but Mirai is such a lame-ass that Akihito can't help it and feels sorry for her. (She has a few good moves, but she's a total /dojikko/ and it's hard to see her battling with a monster like the one we see run through one scene being chased by an acquaintance of Akihito's who is also a Spirit Hunter.) Akihito discovers that Mirai's whole family has the blood sword ability, which creeped out the other Spirit Hunters, leading them to be ostracized. She's the last of her family and, as it turns out, she's scared to hunt /youmu/. Since there's one living in her house, she can't go home. Akihito goes with her to kill it, and the episode ends.

Even though the concept is really unoriginal, the characters are all really likable, the dialogue is clever and fun without being wacky, and the animation is amazing. It's by KyoAni, so that's to be expected. I appreciate that the writers came up with a situation where the main character is already part of the invisible spirit monster world so we can get on with the story instead of having three episodes of info dumps to get us up to speed. And Mirai's constant clumsiness and bad attitude all click together once we find out that she's afraid to hunt Dreamshades and can't go home because of it. The show is in a similar mold to Fate/Stay Night; I don't see it being as good in the end, but it's definitely better than Gatekeepers 21 or Shakugan no Shana.
*** Ikoku Meiro no Croisée
In late-19th Century Paris, Claude and his grandfather Oscar own an iron-crafting shop called Enseigne du Roy which is in a district called Galerie du Roy that's in danger of going away due to changes wreaked by the Industrial Revolution. Oscar is something of a globetrotter, and after a trip to Japan, returns with a bunch of lacquerware and a girl, Yune. Claude is puzzled by Yune, her culture, and what the heck he's supposed to do with her, and as the shop is in a bad place, he's not very happy with her being there. But he warms up to her and teaches her about French culture and language while trying to find something for her to do in the shop.

It's basically slice-of-life, except the lives are in 19th Century Paris. It's super-adorable. Yune, of course, is criminally adorable, but I like Claude too. I also liked how the manga-ka, Takada Hinata, delved a little into the cultural differences and how a 19th Century Frenchman would react to them, instead of just brushing them off. (Takada Hinata has got to be a woman. For one thing, Francophilia is rampant among shoujo artists; even though this was in a shounen magazine, Kirara Max [alongside Is the Order a Rabbit? and K-On], it has a nice shoujo feeling to it. Plus, no man could draw something as adorable as Yune's first appearance, in full color.) Chapter 2 hints that Oscar is not nearly as serious as his grandson, and that he's a much better Frenchman, if you know what I mean; given that, and the thinness of Yune's reason for coming to France, I half-suspect that we'll discover she's Oscar's natural daughter (and thus Claude's aunt). (Although Oscar does say in Chapter 1 that he met her father, so maybe not.)
*** Kill Me Baby!
A moe yon-koma with yuri undertones where the twin-tailed tsundere spends most of her time wreaking horrible violence on the tennen boke. Sonya is a blonde girl with twin-tails who's also one of those highly-trained child assassins commonly seen in anime and manga. Her classmate, Oribe Yasuna, is constantly trying to make friends with her, but Sonya is so keyed up that she uses choke-holds and arm bars on Yasuna whenever she approaches. Despite the horrible pain and multiple broken bones, Yasuna keeps trying to understand Sonya and become better friends with her, finding that despite her combat abilities, Sonya is afraid of ghosts (because choke holds wouldn't work on them) and cockroaches. A third girl, Goshiki Agiri, who is a ninja, also joins them. (Her ninjutsu is pretty lame, though.) 

Even though it's got black humor and isn't as gentle as I usually like my moe yon-koma, it was damn funny.

*** Cyclops Shoujo Saipu
A yon-koma about an obessive oniichanko who's really tall and has hair covering one eye. Her name is Saito Fuuka, so her friends call her Saipu, which is reverse-rendaku'd from Saifu (the first characters of her last and first names), and I guess is short for Saipuropusu, which is a warping of Saikuropusu, which is the Japanese pronunciation of Cyclops. It seems like the author had a clever idea for a series about a really tall girl with hair covering one eye whose nickname is Cyclops, but then had a really hard time finding a way to make that into a nickname for some reason, since he could have just stopped with the punning and used the word "Cyclops" on its own. And that was about the last idea the author had.

Combining elements of OniAi, OniZenzen, OreImo, Kiss x Sis, and Bakemonogatari into an extremely unoriginal ecchi yon-koma, Cyclops Shoujo Saipu was the first time I was ever not entranced into giving something a good review because it had little sisters. (Actually, I didn't like OniZenzen. And OniAi only squeaked by because of Ana and Gin-gin. So I guess this isn't the first time.) It's not even that funny. The jokes are stale. Fuuka is kind of cute, I guess, but she's a pretty boring character, lacking the style of an Akiko, the audacity of an Ako, Riko, or Nao, the interesting history of a Kirino, or the pure spunk of a Karen-chan. (Don't even get me started with Tsukihi-chan, the number one greatest little sister character in the history of the world.) She also doesn't have loli power like Mikan Yuuki, nor the precocious maturity and grace that make Mikan Yuuki, Ui Hirasawa, and Mashiro-Iro Symphony's Sakuno Uryuu cute; she doesn't play particularly well off Hikaru, the brother character, like Mikan Yuuki, Ui Hirasawa, or Ore Imo's Hinata Gokou do off their older siblings, and she doesn't even have an outrageous high concept design like the Sister Princess sisters. She didn't even go Sora Kasugano's route and take me in by being a feisty grey-haired tsundere who gives head. (Quickest route to my heart, right there.) In other words, Fuuka is utterly lacking in the qualities both of an interesting character and an interesting little sister character. She's like the anti-Tsukihi-chan. Just throw Tsukihi-chan and Koyomi in a room, and something interesting happens. Throw Fuuka and Hikaru in a room, and you might as well be looking at an empty room. 

That's really the main reason why this story fails, but it doesn't even get off any good jokes, settling for recycled material and aimless eroticism. Fuuka literally has no life outside of her oniichan, who's isn't even that interesting himself, although I give him credit for genuinely not being interested in her at all. (It would be fine if he were interested, as long as he meant it, like Haruka Kasugano or Kyousuke Kousaka. But disinterest is better than the most common half-assed interest.) 

I can't figure out why I keep reading it. I think it's sort of a Funyun series—it doesn't really taste good, but what little taste it has is so inoffensive that it somehow tricks you into continuing. 

By the way, I tried to squeeze in references to every little sister character I could think of above.

*** Reset!
A companion work to Yuru Yuri, Reset! takes place in the same school (Nanamori Middle School) and sometimes crosses over. Unfortunately, it's on hiatus. I actually liked Reset! better than Yuru Yuri, and that is no insult at all to Yuru Yuri, which I loved.

Hiro Takaoka has no friends and doesn't do anything. One day, she picks up a drawing dropped by second-year sempai Toshinou Kyoko (why does that name sound so familiar?) and gets scouted by a classmate, Aoi Isurugi, to draw art for a game Aoi wants to make. Hiro can't draw at all; she returns the drawing to Kyoko and tries to get Kyoko to team up with Aoi instead, but Kyoko doesn't really listen. Hiro feels worse and worse as her friendship with Aoi deepens and she still doesn't come clean about her lack of drawing ability. 

In Chapter 2, Hiro and Aoi recruit Kudryavka, a weird girl who writes poetry and publishes it in an anthology around the school, to write the scenario for the game. Aoi loved her poetry and felt she could write a beautful scenario. Kudryavka seems to have no idea whatsoever what's going on, though she is with it enough to insist that her name is Kudryavka, "Kud" for short, when Hiro asks what her real name is. (Later, her skirt blows up, and Hiro sees that her panties have the name "Gondagawa Kumako" written on them.) Aoi also has someone in mind for music, although we never get to see this person.

In Chapter 3, we see that Hiro failed in a pretty big way when she was supposed to play the piano for a school event in elementary school, and that made her risk-averse. Hiro is going to finally tell Aoi she can't draw, despite her attempts to learn. She happens to talk with Chinatsu, who claims to be a great artist and says she'll show Hiro some of her work (ugh...just remembering it makes me ill). When Hiro goes to confess to Aoi, Aoi gives her a quill pen and ink and a beret, and Hiro decides she can't do it; she is filled with a new desire to try her best, and decides to go for it. Chapter 3 ends with her seeing Chinatsu's weird goth impressionist kindergartener work and saying "What is this?", then repeating it, just because you gotta. That's the only correct response to Chinatsu's "art".

I loved this series. The characters were super-adorable, especially Hiro. I liked how it had the same fun and yuri feeling as Yuru Yuri, as well as the cameos, but with an actual story. (We see Sakurako, Chitose, Akari, Himawari, and Ayano in the background, and Kyouko, Yui, and Chinatsu interact with the main characters). There were lots of references to Key/Visual Arts, which makes me think the game they make was going to be a weepy visual novel like Key's.  (Kudryavka's penname is, of course, a reference to Kudryavka Noumi from Little Busters, and each cover copies a famous shot from a Key game—Chapter 1 shows Hiro and Aoi in the same pose as Komari and Rin in a Little Busters! picture; Chapter 2, as I discovered after much effort, shows Kudryavka in the same pose as Kudryavka Noumi in a Kud Wafter advertisement; and Chapter 3 shows Hiro and Aoi in the same poses as Ayu and Nayuki in a famous Kanon picture.) It took me about fifteen chapters to really get to like the Yuru Yuri characters and figure out what they're all about, but within just three, I already liked Hiro a lot and was intrigued with Aoi and Kudryavka. (The latter is inherently puzzling, but I felt like there was more to Aoi than there seemed.) I really hope Namori continues this. I know she's busy with Oomuro-ke and Yuru Yuri (which is still going), and Reset! is probably a lot of work since the chapters are long and the art very detailed and dynamic, but I love it, and I hope she'll continue.

*** Shinigami Alice
This and Mugen no Minamo ni are both dark yuri series—although they're yuri, they have dark and abstractly poetic feelings to them, rather than the romantic feel of a Mari Mite or the fun feeling of a Yuru Yuri or Honey Crush. 

Masaki one day sees a beautiful girl in a sailor suit and a big hat kill someone with a giant pair of scissors. The girl goes to kill her too, but Masaki is struck by her beauty and falls in love. The girl with the scissors is thrown off guard and leaves her alone.

Masaki starts putting herself in danger so she can see that girl again, and succeeds. The girl is called Hinageshi. She's an assassin for a mysterious dark organization. Masaki confesses her love, and Hinageshi is mysteriously pulled in and can't escape, despite the fact that her former comrades are now coming to kill her.

Shinigami Alice is a limited-run series. The author wrote that he/she wanted to make something with the same feeling as Noir, which I think was achieved here, although it's a little more fantasy-based. Everything is very dark and mysterious, and we never really find out anything about Hinageshi or the people she works for. But it manages to be interesting all the same. Compared with Mugen no Minami ni, it's more consistent, but not quite as creative or bizarrely moving. The art is very good—Hinageshi is a dark, beautiful, and doll-like assassin even down to her choice of weapon, but also has a certain maturity about her. The ending is very ambiguous and anticlimactic, reinforcing the dark feeling. Yuri Batman?
*** Mugen no Minamo ni
Another dark yuri series, although this one is deceptively light at first. Whereas Shingami Alice is dark, dark, dark, Mugen no Minamo ni has a kind of emotionally dead air to it, punctuated by bursts of feeling. Where Shinigami Alice had a similar feeling to Noir, Mugen no Minamo ni reminds me of a yuri Death Note. (Rem and Misa were sort of yuri, though.)

Kagiri is an immortal. She lives with Minamo, a girl whose body ages faster than her mind; although she now looks about eighteen, she's only nine on the inside. Since Minamo will die twice as early, Kagiri (called "Key-chan" by Minamo, since /kagi/ means "key") works as a hired killer  and trades her victims'  lives with a Time Merchant to extend Minamo's life. Kagiri tries to hide this part of her life from Minamo, while also coping with Minamo's immaturity and warped sense of time, and trying to build a happy life for her in spite of it all. Kagiri also seems to be tormented by her desire for Minamo, who looks like a hot eighteen-year-old babe, but is mentally only nine years old and thus could be traumatized by sex.

The premise is so strange that it took me several chapters to really figure out what was going on, but once I did, I liked it. The writing is also pretty complex, eschewing info dumps and long explanations in exchange for dropped hints, facial expressions, and body language. Although I liked them both, I think this is just a bit better than Shinigami Alice. The art is more moe-looking, though, which sometimes gives it kind of a Higurashi feeling. 
*** Cassiopeia Dolce
Anna Molmoque comes to her new job at a doll shop and finds that she's a lesbian, as is everyone else there. Elsa, the artisan, is sort of a tennen boke lesbian, in that she doesn't seem to realize she's a lesbian. Olga, who seems to handle the business side, is an aggressive lesbian. There's also a living doll, Bernadette, who knows that Anna is holding back her lesbian urges for Elsa and encourages her not to.

It's a pretty cute series. The art is very puni-moe. One of the many Yuri Hime S series that I read off the cover of Yuru Yuri (and Honey Crush). Unfortunately, I think it died when Yuri Hime S did.
*** UQ Holder
How did I not know about this? Ken Akamatsu's newest work, UQ Holder takes place in the same world as Negima. It's totally continuing the shounen battle train that he got on with Negima, so much so that during the entire (70 page) first chapter, only one cute girl appears, and no one's clothes get blasted off!

UQ Holder takes place (apparently) in the same Negima timeline where Asuna was asleep for 130 years, about 70 years after Negima ended. All the Mahora girls are dead or gone, and so is Negi himself (he died in this timeline, despite everyone's belief that he would be immortal). Negi left behind children, who left behind a son, Touta Konoe, whose last name suggests he is also related somehow to the Konoe family, but it can't be that Negi married Konoka, since then his last name would be Springfield. (Which is too bad, I would've liked to have a grandson of Konoka as our hero.) Even though it seemed like Konoka was heading for the yuri ending with Setsuna, I seem to remember that both of them married men in the main timeline of Negima's ending, so it could be that Konoka had a son, who married Negi's daughter, giving birth to Touta and making both of them his grandparents. It would be kind of disappointing if he were just the son of some distant cousin of Konoka's. 

Anyway, Touta lives in a small town where Negi and his parents are buried. His parents died two years before, leaving him in the care of Yukihime, a mysterious woman who teaches Touta and his friends how to fight, and has made them a deal: if they beat her, they can go the capital and ride the space elevator to the magic world. It turns out that Yukihime is Evangeline AK McDowell, aka Eva-chan, aka my favorite Negima character, so yay! We have Eva-chan, my favorite (although in her Yukihime form she's mature and sexy; she even acts more mature than before, possibly since she's now being treated as an adult and even has a child to take care of), and a relative of Konoka, my third-favorite, and grandson of Negi, my fifth-favorite, as main characters. We need relatives of Yue and Nodoka to round out the top five. 

Touta defeats a bounty hunter who's after the bounty on Eva-chan's head, but only after being cut up and drinking Yukihime's blood to become immortal. Yukihime judges him ready to leave, and tells him the truth about who she is and how she saved him from the car wreck that killed his parents. The chapter ends with the two of them going off to the capital, which looks a lot like Megalomesembria, although still kind of Tokyo-ish. 

Possibly my favorite part of the chapter was the prologue, where Eva talks about how things went for her after the Negima series ended. She begins talking about immortality, and says first you part from people you like, and we see her leaving behind the Mahora girls on the beach with ChachaZero. Then she talks about parting from things you like, and we see her leaving behind a presumably broken ChachaZero. The first few pages are in color and show Eva going through a processsion of losses as she lives through the ages. I liked the tone a lot; it felt like we had Eva on a bar stool giving us the straight talk on what it's like to be immortal. Her attitude seems to be: it can be hard and sad, but in the end, what're you gonna do?

This series is out in English, so that's the last of it I'll be reading until I can afford the official release. But I liked it. I think it'll be good for Akamatsu to have an adventure series that's completely unencumbered by any love comedy roots. We know he can write romance pretty well, so although Touta is young (fourteen), if Akamatsu does do love stories in UQ Holder, they can be genuine ones, and not have to occupy themselves with obsessive also-rans like Ayaka Yukihiro or anarchic schemers like Kazumi Asakura, Kitsune, or Sakurako Shiina. (I liked Kazumi despite that; I didn't really need the rest of them. Especially Ayaka, she was almost Mary Sue-like in the later Negima volumes.)

*** Ro-Kyu-Bu!
Somehow I'd been led to believe this series was basically Kodomo no Jikan with basketball, which is 100% not true. It's actually pretty run-of-the-mill. It has cute sixth-grade girls and they dress up as maids and in swimsuit aprons (like hadaka apron but with a swimsuit underneath), but it's more like they just heard somewhere that older boys are into that, without really knowing any better.

Also, the main character, Subaru, is a high school first-year, so he's only like four years older than the girls. He's a basketball ace who is forced to quit when the captain of his school's team is accused of being a pedophile (which I thought was impossible if you were under eighteen, although I guess maybe the captain was a third-year and was eighteen. Koyomi Araragi only got away with it because the girl was a ghost). His aunt, Mihoshi, teaches at a local elementary school and asks him to coach her girls' basketball team. Subaru doesn't want to at first, with the wounds of what harm little girls can do to a man still salting, but he is thoroughly impressed with Tomoka, the club's ace, and ends up helping them. 

Ro-Kyu-Bu is okay, but it's not great. Its main selling point is its five cute girls—Tomoka, the serious one; Maho, the crazy one; Saki, the smart one; Airi, the busty and tall and bashful one; and Hinata, the small and cute one. They're all very cute, but I pretty much described their entire personalities in those few words. (Tomoka is a little deeper than that, but just a little.) The other big selling point, in the anime, is its voice cast. In particular, Tomoka is voiced by Kana Hanazawa, Maho is voiced by Yuka Iguchi, and Saki is voiced by Yoko Hikasa. 

This is based on a novel. How would this story even work in a novel? If you can't see the cuteness of the girls and hear their voices that you loved from Monogatari and K-On and Haganai and Kobato (among others), what's the point? Even Henneko and MM weren't as apparently ill-suited to pure print.
*** Banana no Nana
Sort of a weird moe parody of Rave Master. (It feels closest to Rave Master, but of course there are parallels to Dragon Ball and One Piece and that whole shounen adventure genre.) Nana and Ringo live in a weirdly simplistic fantasy world where everyone has special powers and has to fulfill some crazy requirement to keep them. Nana's powers are all banana-based, and she has to eat a whole banana, skin and all, every time she uses them. Ringo has super leg powers and has to wear a short skirt to keep them. The first villain, Haruko Mizukami, has water powers and has to stay in the bath most of the time (even when she goes out).

The twist is that all the characters are moe girls and the world is full of moe and otaku stuff, instead of the cartoony things that Rave Master and Dragon Ball and One Piece use. There's a country of maids, a country of otaku, etc. Nana is the idiot hero, like Goku and Luffy and what's his face from Rave Master. (She reminds me most of Luffy, because of her hunger for adventure and her weird power.) Ringo is the sensible character, similar to Buruma in Dragon Ball. She and Nana are childhood friends and always promised to go on adventure together. As of the most recent chapter I've read, it seems that a ninja maid is going to join them, and Nana talked about finding more party members, so the group is going to expand. 

I guess this is actually closest to Bobobo-bo-bobobo in tone, since it's so weird and feels like a parody. It has the same illogical world as those other works, where there are modern amenities despite the lack of any infrastructure or civilization capable of producing them. Of course, unlike all those other works, it's full of fan service. Nana wears a school swimsuit in the first chapter; in Chapter 2, Ringo forces a whole banana down Nana's throat in a scene where the banana looks like something else vaguely banana-shaped which is sometimes forced down girls' throats in less savory manga; and we see Ringo's panties (through her black tights, nice) like, every two panels. At first I didn't think I would want to read any more, but inexplicably I started to enjoy it. (No, it's not explicable by the fan service. Otherwise I'd still be reading Eiken.) 

[August 30th, 2014] I finished the series, and geez did the ending suck. I doubt the author planned this ending, though; it seems more like the series was suddenly canceled and the author had to wrap it all up quickly. It seems weird that this series would be canceled since One Piece/Rave Master/Fairy Tail are popular, and moe with fan service is popular, so One Piece/Rave Master/Fairy Tail as moe with fan service should have been popular among someone, probably moe fans, since they tend to like anything that has moe. And Japan has entire manga magazines devoted to moe, so we know there are enough moe fans in Japan to keep a series afloat. 

Anyway, Nana and Ringo defeat the evil mob that employs Hoshi Budou, the ninja maid, using the power of friendship. Budou joins them and the group heads off for Oz. They meet a fire user in a big cave, and later meet a magazine writer and his cute assistant who write a magazine all about adventurers and have done a story featuring Ringo. Ringo is jealous because Budou and Nana are too close. A fortune teller prophesies that the two of them will end up separated, which comes true when they're attacked by Yae Shinichi, a member of the Einherjar, a group that kills off anyone who gets near to Oz. He claims that he killed off Ringo's father. Like Ringo, he is a Limit Breaker, but he can control his power, and he and Ringo fight when she gets angry that he claims her father is dead. Yae punches Ringo, causing her to fly off into the distance. He says she's going to die, either when she hits the ground or falls in the ocean, or else she's going to break through the atmosphere and go into space.

Two years later, we see that Nana has been looking for Ringo. Budou has mysteriously disappeared despite all the trouble that Nana went through to recruit her for their team. Nana randomly runs into Yae again, but then Ringo's father randomly shows up and using his Limit Breaker powers, kicks Nana up to the moon. On the moon, Nana finds Ringo, who tells her that the moon is Oz and that Ringo wished to God to see Nana again. However, wishes to God have a Risk, and this one's is to kill Nana. If Ringo doesn't kill Nana, God will crash the moon into the planet. Ringo says the planet used to have two continents and two moons, but a thousand years ago, a hero reached Oz and made a wish, but didn't fulfill the Risk, causing God to smash the second moon into the planet and destroy half of it. 

Ringo and Nana fight, but Ringo just takes Nana's first blow and lays dying, a banana through her chest. Nana wishes to God for Ringo to live, even though she knows the Risk. She confesses her love to Ringo, and they have lesbian sex using a banana with some spit on it as a dildo. After their lesbian sex, Nana decides that now that they've reached Oz, they should go even further and explore space. She knocks the moon off its orbit and they fly off, also preventing God from slamming the moon into the planet. We see a girl reading the story to some kids a thousand years later. The kids ask what happened after that, and the girl says since the moon was traveling at relativistic speeds, Nana and Ringo are probably still out there somewhere. In the final panel, we see them stepping off on a new planet.

This has the feeling of an ending that was planned out, but went way faster than it should have and became ridiculous as a result. For one thing, the first few chapters emphasized very strongly that there was only one continent on the planet. The fortune teller also predicted that Nana and Ringo would be separated, and everything was moving at a reasonable pace until the last chapter. I imagine the series was supposed to go on for a while, and Nana would have found Ringo in some other way, and some time after they would have met Ringo's father, who would have given them the secret. Everything was set up for a longer series, like the existence of more members of the Einherjar and the introduction of various characters in the last few chapters. As it is, it reminded me of Mahoromatic's space bounty hunter ending, but with graphic lesbian sex, so I guess that makes it slightly better.

It's kind of disappointing, because it was a good series. It almost made me want to take a second look at One Piece, and maybe a first look at Fairy Tail (even though I despised Rave Master), until I remembered that neither of those have moe.

*** Fate/Zero
The prequel to Fate/Stay Night, which I have to say I had mixed feelings about when I watched it again recently. But when I looked over what I wrote again, it seemed like a great many of my complaints were either plot holes that probably weren't in the original material, or problems with the animation. The second most definitely will not be an issue with Fate/Zero, and the first likely won't be either, since Fate/Zero is two seasons (40 episodes in all) and comes from an easier-to-adapt light novel rather than a nightmarish-to-adapt visual novel.

Fate/Zero takes place during the Fourth Holy Grail War, when Kiritsugu Emiya joined the fight on behalf of the non-combative Einzbern family to try and make his ideals a reality. Episode 1 is a one-hour setup that covers pretty much what it took the first three episodes of the Stay Night anime to get through. It introduces all of our Masters, and by the end, each has summoned a Servant and is preparing for battle.

The first episode opens with the birth of Illya, Kiritsugu's daughter with Irisviel (pronounced like English /iris/ plus -viel) von Einzbern, his wife. Three years later, we see Kirei Kotomine recruited to the war by the appearance of command seals on his hand. His father and Tokiomi Tosaka, the weirdly Gary Oldman-like father of Rin and Sakura, explain to him about the war and tell him his job is just to support Tokiomi and make sure he wins, since according to Tokiomi, the Tosaka and Matou only want to summon the "source". 

Meanwhile, Tokiomi's brother (?) Kariya comes home to the Tosaka mansion and meets Rin's mother and Rin herself, who imperiously begs for presents. Kariya asks where Sakura is, only to be told that she was given away to Zouken Matou to raise as a Matou. Kariya has a problem with this; we find out that he himself was also given to the Matou and that he ran away from them, presumably because they're abusive and evil. However, he goes back and begs Zouken to let Sakura go, saying he'll come back in her place. Zouken shows Kariya that he already threw her into the pit of worms, which is sort of like Scrooge McDuck's money pit except grosser, and the worms crawled all over her body and sucked on her and traumatized her. The worms are apparently some kind of magical amplifier where you trade having worms crawl in all your orifices for increased magical power. Zouken fears death and wants to wish for immortality (so much for only wanting the "source"); he plans to use Sakura to breed more mages that can win the Holy Grail for him, to achieve that end. Kariya makes a deal; he'll submit to Zouken's evil and participate in the Fourth War as a Master, and if he wins, Zouken has to let Sakura go. Zouken doesn't think much of Kariya's chances, but since it's a win-win for him, he agrees and starts pumping Kariya full of worms. 

As the beginning of the war draws near, we see the Masters gathering information about each other. Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald, scion of the Archibald family of London, is chosen as a Master. Kayneth teaches a magic class in London; when one of his students, Waver Velvet, writes a paper questioning the established wisdom that long magical lineage and intense training from childhood is the only way to ensure magical ability, Kayneth mocks Waver in front of the whole lecture hall. Waver runs off in a huff and happens to intercept a package from Macedonia addressed to Kayneth. He runs off to his study and reads up, finding out about the Holy Grail War and deciding to prove his worth by becoming a Master and fighting. Waver goes to Japan and makes the preparations to summon a Servant.

Kiritsugu knows about Tokiomi and Kayneth, and Kariya's addition comes as no surprise to him, but he is astounded when he finds out about Kirei. Kirei, for his part, is just as astounded when he hears about Kiritsugu from Tokiomi. Tokiomi is none too pleased either; he complains that Kiritsugu cheats by using sniper rifles, poison, and bombs to kill mages instead of fighting like a man. But Kirei seems to find Kiritsugu's motives much more puzzling; he concludes that no one would undertake the kind of bloody and dangerous work that Kiritsugu did just for money. For his part, Kiritsugu is completely puzzled by Kirei and his apparent lack of ambition. We also see here that Kirei has already summoned his Servant, Assassin, aka Hassan i-Sabbah of the original Assassins of Arabia. 

Everyone else prepares to summon a Servant. One of the Einzbern family members returns from Cornwall with Avalon, King Arthur's scabbard, for Kiritsugu to use in his summoning. The relic is so powerful that Kiritsugu can use it to summon King Arthur, even though their personalities are likely to be incompatible since Kiritsugu fights without chivalry. Kiritsugu expresses some doubt that his partnership with King Arthur can work, but Iri says once they get to know each other, King Arthur will come to believe in Kiritsugu's ideals just as she has, and Kiritsugu gets an idea. (Which is to have Iri act as his Servant's Master while he says hidden, since it's likely their personalities will match better.) 

Before going in to summon his Servant, Kariya, who now has white hair and is subject to random worms crawling through his face underneath his skin, stops to talk to Sakura, now purple-haired. (She originally had the same light brown hair as Rin and Tokiomi, as did Kariya himself.)  He tells her that he won't be able to talk to her as much for a while, but soon they'll schedule a meeting with her mother and sister. Sakura says Zouken told her those people don't exist as her mother and sister, so Kariya says they'll meet Aoi-san and Rin-chan. He goes into the former worm room, where Zouken has him add to his summoning verse to summon his Servant as Berserker, since he abandoned his training and consequently is a weaker mage than the other Masters. As we'll learn later, he summons Lancelot as a Berserker. (In the legends, Lancelot went into a berserk rage and killed Gawain, who begged Arthur on his deathbed to make amends with Lancelot for the good of the kingdom. And Kariya is a young, handsome, and chivalrous man doing his best to save a lady, even if she's just his five-year-old niece.) 

Waver Velvet has brainwashed an old couple to think he's their grandson and is staying at their house. He uses chicken sacrifice along with a scrap of cloth from Macedonia in his ceremony, and as we'll find out later, summons Rider, whose true identity is Alexander the Great! (Makes sense, Alexander was big on cavalry.) We also see Tokiomi summon Archer, aka Gilgamesh, with Kirei at his side.

Finally, Kiritsugu and Iri use Avalon and summon Saber, aka King Arthur. They are shocked that King Arthur is female, and Saber says her famous line, "I ask of you, are you my Master?"

The Fate series always has humorous names for its non-Japanese characters (Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald? Is he half-Jewish and half stiff upper lip? And Waver Velvet? Granted, everything sounds funny when your surname is Velvet, so Mr. and Mrs. Velvet did just as well to double down and name their son "Waver". "Jack Velvet" is just as funny.) Otherwise, this episode was really cool and full of all the great dark stuff from the first series, with new great animation by a studio called ufotable (they're doing another take on Stay Night this fall, though no one knows quite which story they're covering). The characters are all really interesting so far too. Kiritsugu is very dark and conflicted; it seems like he's having doubts about his ideals (that he later passes on to Shirou), both whether they can be realized and whether he, with his past, is capable of doing so even if it is possible. Kariya was the most flat-out likable so far, and I expect he'll have an interesting arc. We already know he fails if we watched Stay Night, which will give his arc a tragic inevitability, but it'll be interesting to see how his participation sheds light on the morality of other characters.

Kariya is also interesting because of what he shows us about Tokiomi. Tokiomi sort of seems hard, cold, and ruthless; the first thing we ever see him do is plot to cheat his way into winning. On the other hand, through Kariya, we also see evidence that he might be incredibly naive. Tokiomi's daughter, Rin, was always a softie in the end, despite her attempts to seem brutal and ruthless; but Rin seemed to have a good sense for people that let her see who was trustworthy and who wasn't, as when she turned down Shinji's alliance because Shiro was more trustworthy, or when she realized that Illya was no longer a threat after Berserker's death. (Though she too was taken in by Kirei.) Tokiomi doesn't seem to have this. He thinks that the Matou's goals are aligned with his, apparently having been taken in by Zouken; he even gives them his daughter, which initially seems ruthless, but might also have come in part from his mistaken belief that she would be raised well. Kariya, who knows Zouken's true colors, is horrified when he hears that Sakura was given to him and runs off to save her. Tokiomi also complains about Kiritsugu's lack of honor, and he seems to trust Kirei, but Kirei seems to be plotting to kill him and steal Gilgamesh.

I expect Kayneth to take on the role of straight villain / mid boss (and we can assume he summons Lancer, the only class not yet summoned). More interesting is his former student, Waver. Waver is a bit like Rin was at the beginning of Stay Night: being a Master is a matter of pride for him, an affirmation of talent and worth. But the Holy Grail War has a significant moral element to it. Some Masters and Servants do whatever it takes to win without regard to ethics—Shinji Matou, Soichirou Kuzuki and Caster, and Kirei Kotomine. They steal souls from the innocent, kill anyone they want, and do it all for their own desires. Others try to wage the war ethically—Shirou, of course, and also Rin, in the end. It seems like Kiritsugu intends to use whatever underhanded tactics he has to in order to kill the other Masters, but to do so in order to achieve some greater goal; Kariya might be the same. What kind of Master will Waver be? Will his pride and desire for recognition be enough to drive him to the lengths the other Masters are willing to go to in order to win? Kayneth may be a jerk, but nothing he did to Waver is worth death, and Waver has no grudge at all against the others. (Kiritsugu, I'm sure, wouldn't hesitate to kill Kayneth, because he thinks he has the moral high ground.)

I have high hopes for this series after the first episode. I think the story will be great, but I'm also looking forward to seeing how the new animation does in combat. The Stay Night fight scenes were mostly pretty lame, especially the final battle, but the non-combat animation by ufotable is far superior to Deen's Stay Night, so hopefully that will also carry through to battles. Also, we still have King Arthur, Alexander the Great, Gilgamesh, Lancelot, et al. fighting each other!

(I wish they would adapt Apocrypha since it has Shakespeare. And Frankenstein's Monster (vers. moe), and Jack the Ripper (vers. moe). But especially Shakespeare.)

[July 20th] I'm going to make a separate file for the rest of Fate/Zero; this is just a correction. According to the Type Moon wiki, Kariya actually is a Matou who happened to be born with magic, unlike his brother who is Shinji's father. Aoi, Rin and Sakura's mother and Tokiomi's wife, was his girlfriend, but various things happened and she ended up married to Tokiomi, which Kariya did not begrudge her. So he's not actually related to Sakura, and he /is/ actually related to Zouken, but he knows what a bastard Zouken is, and he cares about Sakura because he cares about her mother (and it also seemed like he preferred Sakura to Rin among Aoi's children, probably because she's so sweet and Rin is kind of a brat, as we see when she dresses down Kirei and orders him to keep her father safe. Maybe Rin is more Tokiomi's child, and Sakura is more Aoi's child, causing Kariya to prefer Sakura. But I'm sure he wouldn't wish Zouken on Rin either, since he knew what a bastard Zouken was).

*** One Week Friends
Basically has the same plot as the Chihiro story in Ef, but way better executed. Fujimiya Kaori loses her memories of anyone close to her every week (very selectively, unlike the total wipeout that Chihiro was subject to), so she isolates herself in class by acting angry and cold. One day she drops her façade a bit around Hase Yuki, who becomes intrigued and starts trying to be friends with her. He succeeds, and suggests that she keep a diary to remind herself of what happened, like Chihiro.

The synopsis sounds pretty stupid, but I really just hurried through it so I could get to talking about how ridiculously adorable and heartwarming this series is so far. (I've seen the first two episodes.) So far, they've done an incredible job of building a rapport between Kaori and Yuki and showing how sweet and cute their relationship is. Not only is the chemistry between the characters better than in Ef (and it wasn't even that bad in Ef), the story also avoids the two major mistakes of Ef: snail-speed pacing and over-the-top angst. Yuki finds out about Kaori's amnesia within the first episode, and suggests the diary to her in the second episode. The angst part is very minor and handled well; when Yuki is about to angst, his friend Shogo suggests that he do something instead, which he does.

Yuki feels a bit like the viewpoint men in shoujo manga; he's a good guy, very social, kind of laid back, earnest and a little effeminate. He makes a good match for Kaori, also very earnest, but very reserved, though also bright and enthusiastic. The art is amazing, too. It's very bright and pastel, with a permanent shine around the edges, a technique most anime reserve for flashbacks, giving the scenes a happy and timeless air. Kaori is adorable, with her droopy eyes and sweet, slow smile. 

My feeling is we're heading away from romance for a while, probably to come back to it in the later episodes. For now, Yuki and Kaori are just friends, although Yuki realizes when they hang out on Sunday how much like a date it is. But it's so relaxed and sweet, unlike Golden Time (which was good, but definitely not relaxed), that I think we'll stay away from the angst that can often make romances tedious.
** Sunday, June 1st, 2014:
*** Golden Time
Tada Banri has amnesia. He goes to college with no memories of his life before his high school graduation and, by chance, meets Yanagisawa Mitsuo, a handsome classmate. Mitsuo is being stalked by his childhood friend, Kaga Kouko, who insists that they're lovers and will be married; Mitsuo changed his college choice just to get away from her, but she found out and followed him. Mitsuo spends the first few weeks of class running away from her, using Banri to fend her off. Banri starts talking to her and begins to develop feelings for her himself; they end up going out by Episode 7, but Banri also meets Rinda, a girl from his past who also loves him, although he'd forgotten her until they met again at college. 

So far the show is a pretty good romance, but it's not quite as good as I expected from Toradora writer Yuyuko Takemiya. The characterizations vacillate a lot, which makes some characters (Kouko, Oka Chinami) feel deeper, and others (Banri) feel inconsistent. Banri seems quite even and mild-mannered in the first few episodes, but later starts to seem almost crazy. He's also very different in the (somewhat clumsy) flashback to his past where we find out what happened between him and Rinda. Kouko is the start of the cast, I think; she's very 90s (in a good way, and like the show in general), and is sexy, confident, and strong, but also has a vulnerable side and a peppy side. She's voiced by Yui Horie, who is brilliant as usual. But even Kouko isn't quite as fun or likeable as the Toradora cast. That's why I ultimately started watching—
*** Is the Order a Rabbit?
Another insanely cute moe yon-koma show, the best I've seen in a while. The girls are all named after teas or coffees, and the show has a central European coffee house theme to it (although one of the girls, Chiya, runs a Japanese tea house). The backdrops remind me of Sugar: A Little Snow Fairy, which is all to the good.

The characters are somewhat archetypey, and Lize the soldier girl feels downright Love Hina-y, but they also feel like they have more to them than the Lucky Star girls or even the GA girls. Cocoa, the main heroine, is the ditz and somewhat like Yui Hirasawa, in that she's an idiot-savant. (She's really good at math and physics, but awful at liberal arts. She's apparently a good reader, though, since she's read Dostoevsky's /Crime and Punishment/. She's also good at latté art.) Chino, the straight girl, is small, cute, quiet, and deadpan, but we see that she's really a little girl inside after all. Lize the soldier girl was a bit hard to take at first, though once I got over the high concept design it became clear that she's just the "Oneesan" character. (She resembles Azu-nyan with the body of Mio.) 

I liked all three of them, but I really liked the last two characters, Chiya and Sharo. Chiya and Cocoa go to the same school and turn out to be the only two people on the planet who understand one another's thought processes. Chiya tends to jump to conclusions in her mind, and she likes coming up with absurdly poetic names for the sweets she makes at her sweet shop. She and Sharo are childhood friends and she seems to like torturing Sharo. Sharo is an honor student who everyone sees as a refined and elegant upper class girl, but she's actually poor and lives in a shack next door to Chiya. She goes to great pains to retain her image, though. She has a crush on Lize and tends to be a frantic flailer. Chiya tormenting Sharo was adorable, and it was super cute in Episode 4 when Sharo tutored Chino at the library. Chino and Cocoa were super cute too; Cocoa is determined to be Chino's big sister, despite Chino's reluctance. Lize isn't bad either, but so far she hasn't had any super cute scenes yet (maybe the way she and Sharo met counts, when she rescued Sharo from one of the feral rabbits that randomly roams the town. No, it isn't like the Monty Python rabbit; Sharo is lapinophobic. And that was more of an adorable Sharo scene). 

So far I don't like it quite as much as K-On, but it has a lot of things to recommend it. The European architecture is gorgeous, and the writers are more clever than the K-On writers when it comes to jokes. The world has a fantasy feeling to it that I dig. In a lot of ways it reminds me of my own attempt at moe yon-koma, /Strawberry Sunflower/.

*** Yuri Mekuru Hibi
I downloaded Yuru Yuri, which was printed in a magazine called Yuri Hime, and found a bunch more yuri series by looking at the front covers of the magazine included with the chapters. This was one of them.

It's pretty damn funny, which I didn't really expect. It's about two yuri high school girls, normal girl Sayuri and upper-class beauty Yoriko. Yoriko is actually a total weirdo, though, and a pretty big Cloud Cuckoolander. The art isn't laid out in four panels, but the story is written like a yon-koma. 

The series draws on most of the stereotypes of yuri, like the huge exclusive girls' school and romantic sempai / kouhai relationships that Mari Mite began. A lot of the humor comes from Yoriko subverting all the tropes about purity, grace, and decorum by doing or suggesting gross, creepy, and bizarre things with apparent innocence. She was a really fun character, almost like Azumanga Daioh's Osaka as a yuri sempai. I liked Yoriko's sister Yoshina-chan, too; she was adorable. She parodies the insanely obsequious underclassmen from shows like Strawberry Panic and Otoboku, and greets Sayuri by throwing herself to the ground and kowtowing. She also says she's going to commit seppuku because she drops the mini mont blanc that Sayuri tries to feed her. [She actually gets down on all fours to lick it up off the ground—same difference.]
** Monday, February 17th, 2014:

Today, I saw Kana Hanazawa in three different roles: Monogatari's Sengoku Nadeko, Kami Nomi's Shiomiya Shiori, and Kobato's Hanato Kobato. She seems to be everywhere. And that is absolutely okay with me.

Kobato: I remembered that Kana Hanazawa plays the super adorable lead role of this CLAMP series, so I decided to give it a chance. I certainly didn't hate the manga, though the story took a little too long to get going and there was always something missing on the adorability front. I think it's that Ioryogi doesn't quite hold up his end as the foil. Fujimoto and Sayaka don't quite make up for it either. Think about how important Tomoyo and Touya are to Sakura's adorableness, or Nobue is to Ana's and Matsuri's. Kobato doesn't have anyone like that; Ioryogi doesn't get to Touya's level.

But the whole premise works much better as an anime, because we have color, movement, music, and Hanazawa. Also, the first episode skims over everything from the first volume and ends with Kobato receiving the magic bottle, which I was really hoping for, because the biggest weakness of the manga was how long it takes for the story to get going. In the process, a lot of the CLAMP universe stuff goes, but I think it's an acceptable loss, much more so than losing the multiverse stuff from the anime versions of Tsubasa and xxxHolic. 

In this anime version, Kobato goes from being super adorable to being mega adorable. She's just too cute with light and sound and music and Hanazawa, especially Hanazawa. In the very first scene I almost expected Ioryogi to be voiced by Shinichiro Miki (because I had just finished watching Hitagi End Part 6, which is mostly Shinichiro Miki as Kaiki and Kana Hanazawa as Nadeko talking about Nadeko's dream to be a manga artist). I loved the last scene of Episode 1 where she comforts a crying baby by singing. I liked how long they resisted adding the backup music and just stuck with her pure voice. Kana Hanazawa really has a nice voice. No man could invent a character this adorable. Only a woman could do it. I love it when female authors create adorable characters. By the way, Kana Hanazawa voiced both Kobatos: this one and the one in Haganai, Kobato Hasegawa. (Because Hasegawa Kobato was a ripoff of Kuroneko.) So who wins in an adorability contest? It's tough but I have to say Hanato beats Hasegawa. Hasegawa has better foils than Hanato, though. But in a one-on-one adorable-off, I think Hanato has to win.

The Portrait of M and N: This is a manga by Gakuen Alice's Tachibana Higuchi that I read some of a little while ago. Unlike Gakuen Alice, it's a more traditional shoujo story that deals with high school romance, except it has the weird spin that the main heroine, despite her proper upbringing and mature beauty, is a frantic flailer who flails frantically over the fact that she's a masochist who goes into an erotic frenzy whenever she gets hurt and tries to enslave herself to the nearest boy, begging him to hit her. She's sort of like the female version of MM's Sado Taro, except the injuries she sustains are pretty awful; I winced at many of them. 

Mitsuru Abe, our masochistic heroine, had trouble at her middle school because of this, so she enrolled in a high school far away. On the first day she encounters Natsuhiko, a boy who discovers her secret and starts trying to help her hide it. It turns out that Natsuhiko is a narcissist; when he sees himself in the mirror, he goes into a frenzy of self adoration. He wears glasses he doesn't need so he can't see well enough to see his own reflection. So he and Mitsuru end up having to help each other, and of course they fall in love as they do.

The series works because the heroes are actually very nice and likable people; Mitsuru even has a rather moe personality. She's kind of fragile and a bit of an airhead, and a frantic flailer as I mentioned, and she likes making sweets. Her character design is a little weird in the early chapters (she has a tiny head—I think because Higuchi was trying to emphasize her mature looks by not making her head too big, and went overboard) but it evens out later on. Natsuhiko is actually a nice guy and keeps going out of his way to help Mitsuru even though he thinks he'd rather not get involved with her too much. Both of them have not very nice pasts that led to their weirdnesses—Mitsuru's demanding mother used to hit her when she erred in her rich girl training, which Mitsuru interpreted as her mother's way of showing love, and began to associate love with pain. Natsuhiko was ill as a child, and trapped inside, he started talking to his own reflection just from boredom. (His parents are very nice and supportive, but they're thrilled to see that he has a friend when he brings over Mitsuru.) But there's no angst or torment; they still grew up to be good people, and it's easy to sympathize with them, despite how bizarre their plights are.

Reading The Portait of M and N reinforces my belief that Tachibana Higuchi is a skilled character writer with a good grasp on humor. I found out about it because I ended up on a big list of female comics authors on Wikipedia, happened to click on Higuchi's name, and saw it in her list of works along with Gakuen Alice. I'd like to read more, but it's not being published in the US anymore (it was a Tokyopop book) and the illegal scanlation I was reading has run out.

** Tuesday, January 15th, 2014:

The first ones for this year. Nothing very notable here, unfortunately. Sunday Without God probably could've gone here too, except that the first episode was pretty interesting so I wanted to write more about it. I kind of got bored with Nyaruko, so I went on a quest for something else; I think I've settled on Kami Nomi: Goddesses at this point, but thanks to everyone else for playing!

GJ-bu: A moe yon-koma series, except it was actually a novel, not a yon-koma. The titular GJ-bu (stands for "Good Job-bu") features Mao, the short and fiery president voiced by Chuu2's Maaya Uchida; her sister Megumi, a gentle, tea-loving girl; Shion, a super genius who plays chess against the world grand-master; and Kirara, a blonde cavewoman who loves meat. The main character is named Kyoya; he's voiced by Hiro Shimono and is rather generic. 

I kind of feel bad being so underwhelmed by this series, because I used to love stuff like this so much (K-On, Lucky Star, Ichiroh, GA). I even went back and read Suzunari again and found that it was better than I gave it credit for. (Sunshine Sketch, sadly, wasn't. The anime's ending songs are so good, too.) It wasn't all bad; there was a somewhat funny joke where Megumi "punished" Kyoya for breaking her favorite teacup by making him say her name a hundred times. ("Say my name." Heisenberg!) Then everyone else wants the same treatment, probably because it took place with Kyoya sitting on a chair and facing her and it was sort of like one of those soulful "Oh, John..."/"Oh, Mary..." romance things. Kirara doesn't get it when he calls her Kirara-san and says "Not three. One hundred!" Sadly, it was pretty generic, though. I think before I finished this series, I would a) Watch K-On again; b) Watch Lucky Star again; c) Watch the anime of GA (cute and charming, even if not as funny as the first two); d) Watch Aria again; e) Watch the rest of Yuru Yuri (decent humor and yuri); f) Download fansubs of Kin-iro Mosaic (super-cute character designs, even if a lot of the jokes fall flat when you don't speak Japanese). I just feel bad being too mean to it, because I felt like they had good intentions, but weren't able to deliver on the necessary content. Maybe it gets better. Content like this is actually pretty hard to write, so maybe there was a learning curve. 

Inu x Boku SS: Actually, I feel bad being mean to all the series in here, because they all seemed like they had good intentions. No one was just blatantly and lazily stealing things without regard for copyright law. (Only once has that ever worked out—Haganai, please stand up. I felt like Ore Imo's first series was about 20% ahead of Haganai's, but Haganai Series II blew Ore Imo II out of the water in almost every way, other than Hanazawa exposure.) 

Anyway, Inu x Boku is sort of like the otaku version of Inu Yasha. Ririchiyo, the main character, is a girl from a rich family who's been allowed to live on her own in an apartment building for the super rich. Everyone in the mansion gets a personal member of the 'Secret Service' to look after them. On the day she moves in, a handsome butler named Soushi appears and starts talking about how much he's wanted to meet her and how his whole life is devoted to serving her and he loves her and blah blah blah. Ririchiyo is socially inept and has a tendency to get bitchy with people just to cover her discomfort; she tries to fire Soushi, but he hands her a katana and says if she does not require his service, he'll just die. 

Soushi waits on Ririchiyo hand and foot, fulfilling her every whim, though she quickly learns that he'll really do anything she asks, and makes sure to order him to look after himself too. Soushi introduces her to the other members of the Secret Service on her floor: Karuta, a weirdo with orange hair and a soft voice, and Nobara, a voluptuous blonde lesbian. (She freaks out over how cute and sexy Ririchiyo is when the first meet, and says "Let's be good friends! In a sexual way, of course!")

It turns out that everyone in the mansion is an ayakashi, a monster of some kind. Soushi is a dog demon whose true form is astonishingly like Inu Yasha. We don't see what Ririchiyo really looks like, but her eyes glow, and her friend from down the hall is some kind of scroll monster. Karuta is a big skeleton, and Nobara is a yuki-onna. 

The show had a few good jokes (Nobara's and Karuta's introductions; Karuta sticks a Bugler corn chip on Ririchiyo's finger and runs off) and the art and production values are pretty nice. It also had an all-star cast; Yuichi Nakamura voices Soushi, Kana Hanazawa voices Karuta (speaking of Hanazawa exposure), and Yoko Hikasa voices Nobara. (She does have a deep, mature, sexy voice. That's what made Mio sing so well, and it squared with Mio's large size, even if it didn't square with Mio's personality. She was good as Izumi Takanashi in Working too.) Rina Hidaka voices Ririchiyo; I can't find any character I know of that she's played except for Last Order from To Aru Majutsu no Index, but she was pretty good as Ririchiyo. (At first I thought it was Kana Hanazawa playing Ririchiyo, with her Kuroneko voice. She uses her Nadeko voice for Karuta.) In fact, I thought at first that this would be the successor to Nyaruko. But after the big reveal at the end, I was a little disappointed. I'm kind of sick of supernatural creature shows, especially since none of them are as good as Monogatari. And it seems pretty obvious that we're heading for Ririchiyo and Soushi hooking up. Plus, the good jokes weren't as good as I wanted them to be. Still, I do feel bad bagging on this show. I think mindset (the importance of when and how, again) is a big part of it, and at another time I might enjoy both this and GJ-bu a lot. That's really why I made this file: so that I never forget a series that had potential, and so I stay away from shows that proved within the first few episodes that they're not worth the time.

C Control: I watched this on Pivot, also known as UHN (Urban Hipster Network). They did a good job managing the commercial breaks (I also have DVR now so I can just fast-forward them). I don't like dubs, though, and they haven't gotten any better since I stopped watching them. The show wasn't very good, either. I missed the first episode so I didn't have the slightest idea what was going on, but basically it was sort of like X combined with Shakugan no Shana combined with Yugioh with a weird financial theme. The main character is involved in some kind of weird shady underground where people go to an alternate dimension called the "Financial District" and fight using magical helper spirits. The fights are called "Deals" and apparently have something to do with how money changes hands in the real world. The main character's father was involved in the Financial District himself and went bankrupt, killing himself as a result. In the episode I saw, the main character defeats one of his college professors, a happily married man with three children. (One yet unborn.) The main character discovers that his teacher somehow put the children's existences down as collateral, so now that he's bust, his children have been erased from existence and no one remembers them, including his wife.

The art style was kind of interesting; it reminded me of a grittier Noein, or maybe Eureka 7 with darker colors. I wasn't that big on the material, though. I hate finance; I find it boring and disgusting. I'm also not that into action shows anymore; even Fate Stay Night and To Aru Kagaku no Railgun only held me in with the comedy subplots, moe characters like Rin and Saten, and (in FSN's case) the over-the-top nature of the fights. (The final battle of FSN was such a DBZ fight, with Saber yelling "EKUSU....KYARIBAAAAAAAAA!!!!" and Gilgamesh countering with "ENUMA...ELISH!!!!" until Saber somehow gains the power to stamp out his Enuma Elish and defeat him.) For those reasons, plus the dub, I didn't really get into C Control. Still, it was worth writing about.

Haiyore! Nyaruko-san!: Mahiro Yasaka is saved from monster attack one day by a mysterious silver-haired girl who tells him that she's Nyarlathotep from the Cthulhu mythos. She says the Elder Things are actually aliens and that she's part of the space enforcement agency that protects underdeveloped planets from space criminals.

Nyaruko (as she takes to calling herself in order to fit in in Japan) explains that space beings love Earth because they're all otaku and only Earth produces anime and manga. She says she took the assignment so she could come buy all she wants and smuggle it through the export quota. She also says when she looked at Mahiro's file and saw who she would be protecting, she decided that he was just her type. Nyaruko moves into Mahiro's house and enrolls in his school so she can protect him from the Elder Things that are trying to kidnap him for a slave ring. She has a shield that brings them into an alternate dimension so she can take apart the monsters using her "Space CQC", a combination of nutshots and whacking stuff with a crowbar (so it's like krav maga).

Nyaruko is a lot like To-Love-Ru, although it dispenses with the consistency of world that would allow serious plots like To-Love-Ru and Love Hina have; it has more of a crazy gag feeling to it, with lots of parodies and absurdities. (In one scene Nyaruko decides she's too lazy to fight with a monster, so she pulls out a pokeball and unleashes a space monster which looks quite menacing, but is actually a weakling who has 99 losses and one draw.) I was kind of skeptical during the initial explanatory scene of the show since it was sort of lame, but the show doesn't bother pretending that it's original, and hurries through the boring setup to quickly reach its main strengths, fast-paced jokes and fan service. I kind of wish it would've done more with its bizarre concept of incarnating the Great Elder Things as moe girls, but it was fun enough in the first episode. The art and animation are really nice too; I have a weird thing about grey-haired girls, and Nyaruko is, to use her own phrase, "totally within my strike zone" in that respect. Her big green eyes and petite loli body help too. The fight scenes are amazing; it's kind of a waste that this show gets awesome fighting animation while Fate/Stay Night has such disappointing fight scenes. Also, the ending song was super adorable.

Shinryaku! Ika Musume: Ika Musume ("Squid Girl") lives at the bottom of an increasingly garbage-filled ocean and is tired of humans treating her home as a dump. She decides to invade the surface and subjugate humanity, starting with the first building she comes across, a beachside cafe owned by the Aizawa siblings. However, she is completely ignored when she declares her dominion of the cafe, and no one believes she's anything but a weird girl with dreadlocks until she proves to Aizawa Eiko, the middle sibling, that those are actually her powerful tentacles by punching a hole in the wall. Eiko makes her work as a waitress to pay off the debt for breaking the wall.

The youngest Aizawa sibling, Takeru, happens to meet Ika Musume on the beach and wants to play with her. Ika Musume makes him her subordinate and tries to use the new force to take over the cafe. She decides that Takeru is no good, so Takeru makes a hat like hers out of paper and attaches some blue streamers to it to serve as tentacles, which completely fools her. When the wind blows the hat off, Ika Musume is convinced that her squid compatriot died and gives it a burial at sea.

Ika Musume sneezes and gets squid ink all over the oldest Aizawa sibling, Chizuru, who seems kind and gentle compared with Eiko. Chizuru goes to take a shower and wash the ink off. Meanwhile, the restaurant empties out, so Ika Musume decides to try and subjugate them. (Especially after discovering that people eat squid.) She grabs Eiko and Takeru in her tentacles (Takeru thinks it's fun being lifted into the air by her tentacles) and says she's going to eat them before she gets eaten, but Chizuru comes back and turns out to be a master of martial arts, easily subduing Ika Musume. She then has Ika Musume vomit some ink on a plate of pasta and eats it, deciding that it's good. Squid ink pasta becomes their new specialty, but no one knows that they have Ika Musume in the back vomiting on all the plates, and when she gets all dried up and tries to stop, Chizuru comes back and threatens her.

This was a pretty good absurdist comedy. It reminded me a bit of Pani Poni Dash or Digi Charat. (Even the character designs and opening animation are sort of 90s looking.) It was especially Digi Charat-like because of the animal theme and the untranslatable use of language—Ika Musume uses de geso which apparently means "squid tentacles" instead of the copula da or desu. (It resembles de aru, the formal copula.) This was translated as squid puns, like "No squidding way!" or "You're out of your squidding mind!" In some ways the translation makes it funnier, because the word "squid" just sounds funny. The episodes are split into three segments, all with titles that end in nai ka (because Ika Musume emphasizes that combination in speech as na ika, since ika means "squid"). Ika Musume is voiced by Hisako Kanemoto; I had only seen her in Kokoro Connect, but she's cute here. Apparently an obsessive stalker of Ika Musume who appears later is voiced by Kanae Ito, who sings the ending song as well.

C^3: Cube x Curse x Curious (or something like that): Quite generic. The main character's father sends him a crate containing a naked girl (or maybe the crate is the naked girl, I forget) named Fear who is the human incarnation of some cursed tool. The series doesn't waste time on unnecessary niceties like story setup; instead we get a nonsensical five-second explanation of the premise, followed by a breast-size insulting fight between the main character's busty childhood friend and the more modest Fear, then Fear tries to clean the house and messes everything up. Very generic and forgettable. Fear's appearance was cute enough (as was the childhood friend's), and she was voiced by Eri Kitamura (Karen-chan!), but her personality was pretty lame: a childish tsundere who doesn't know how this world works.

Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko: I was expecting something of roughly the same quality and type as C^3, and the first scene, where main character Yuto Yokodera is doing squats with the track team so he can look into the swimming pool and see the girls in bathing suits, didn't inspire much confidence. It turned out to be better than I thought, though. Yuto's track captain, a frightening yet attractive girl known as the Steel King (yes, king, not queen), believes that he's a devoted member of the track team and announces that she's making him the captain when she graduates. Yuto, it turns out, wants to be able to openly be a pervert, but he has a social façade that prevents him from doing so. He hears from a friend that a local god, the Stony Cat, will take away something you don't need and give it to someone who needs it, in exchange for an offering. (The friend got rid of his own perversion like this.)

Yuto brings his blow-up doll, Barbara (which actually does look like one of those hideous $10 blow-up dolls they sell in sex shops) to the top of a hill where the Stony Cat is. He offers Barbara in exchange for his facade, but in the middle is interrupted by Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi. Tsukiko is a first-year from Yuto's high school who is worried that she childishly shows her emotion too often and has come to ask the Stony Cat to take away that part of her. Yuto argues that girls are cutest when they're a bit childish, but Tsukiko disagrees with him. The belt Yuto used to bind Barbara to himself on his bicycle, and one of Tsukiko's nikuman, both disappear mysteriously, and Yuto wakes up the next morning to find that he speaks every perverted or socially unacceptable thought that enters his mind, earning him the nickname "Hentai Ouji" (Prince Pervert). He meets Tsukiko and discovers that she has lost the ability to show emotion on her face; as her voice was pretty flat to begin with, this leaves her pretty much at the Rei Ayanami / Yuki Nagato level. They both decide that they aren't happy and want to get back the things they've lost by finding the people who received them and persuading those people to give them back.

Yuto discovers that Azuki Azusa, a rich first-year girl, received his social façade after he sees her politely decline a boy who asks her out, when just yesterday she screamed at another boy, calling him worthless. With Tsukiko's help, he decides to get close to Azusa and get back his social facade. They discover that despite her apparent wealth, Azusa works several part-time jobs, including a waitress job at a cafe and a traffic signaler at a construction site, and sleeps on the roof of the school during the day because she often doesn't get enough sleep. Yoto invites Azusa on a date, to show her, as he puts it, things that commoners enjoy; Tsukiko ends up crashing the date, and all three of them hang out together at an arcade. Azusa and Tsukiko get along well, and Azusa begins to hate Yoto less, but due to a misunderstanding, Azusa gets angry at them. While in the restroom recovering from a tsundere attack, Yoto's track captain, who turns out to be Tsukiko's sister Tsukushi Tsutsukakushi, appears and tries to kill him for not training on Sunday. Yoto grabs Tsukiko and runs away, but Tsukiko persuades him that there's no need to run from her sister. They go back and find that in the meantime, Azusa returned and happened to run into some enemies from her middle school, who mock her for being friendless and hanging out alone in an arcade. Believing the whole thing was set up by Yoto and Tsukiko to humiliate her, Azusa gets angry and storms off.

I was expecting this show to be pretty dumb, but it turned out to be surprisingly good. The art, animation, and music are all high-quality, which is nice. I liked the characters, too. The fansub site where I got Episode 1 (before discovering the series was on Crunchyroll) featured lots of posts claiming that Azuki Azusa was the best girl, and even had a mock post for April Fool's Day explaining that their group was breaking up because someone dared to suggest that Azuki Azusa was not the best girl and Tsutsukakushi Tsukiko was the best girl. Actually, my favorite was Tsukiko, so I'm part of the rebel faction. Azusa is cute, and I normally like expressive, hot-tempered tsundere types (like Kirino), especially when they're haughty and yet have to suffer various blows to their perceived coolness (like Kami Nomi's Haqua). But I couldn't resist the adorableness of Tsukiko's expressionless face and soft, flat voice. I also liked her down-to-earth, girl-next-door appearance as compared with the over-the-top Azusa. It probably didn't hurt that both of them had names which evoked mega-level characters: (Nakano) Azusa and Tsuki(hi|ko). I actually didn't mind Yoto either; he was an idiot, as he should be, and his voice was sort of nasal and dopey, as it should be; I thought it was funny how he calls Azusa "Azuki Azusa" all the time, even in cases where Japanese would let you leave out a term of address, and I also found it humorous how he's just stumbling around without a clue. Despite his perversion, though, he's actually not clueless when it comes to girls; he sucks up to Tsukiko by bringing her to an animal-themed cafe to plan his conquest of Azusa, which she seems to enjoy (as hard as it is to tell), and he correctly deduces that Azusa is lacking in fun and social interaction, and brings her out on the date to liven up her life.

Henneko is actually based on a light novel series, which seems to usually end well (unless the novel is written in the third-person; even then it can turn out well, like Spice and Wolf, or badly, like Kokoro Connect). Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai was also based on a light novel (which surprisingly did not have either Kumin or Dekomori in it—what can you even do without those two?) and also turned out well. Henneko was a cute, fun series that wasn't totally stupid and showed signs of having actual character development in the future.

** Saturday, March 30th, 2013:

Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai: If I hadn't read the Ore Imo novels recently, I probably never would have watched this show, because that was where I learned what a chuunibyou is. A chuunibyou is someone obsessed with darkness, dark magic, dark powers, black, demons, and witchcraft, similar to an American goth. Ore Imo's Kuroneko was constantly described as a chuunibyou by Kirino (as well as Iori Fate Setsuna, who also described herself this way). The word comes from the word for second-year middle schooler, I guess because it's pretty common for kids to go through their 'dark' stage at this time. Yugioh is a total chuunibyou show in my opinion; X is another, more mature one. From what I hear, Darker than Black defines chuunibyou anime (makes sense, based on the title). 

Yuuta Togashi (who is totally voiced by Jun Fukuyama; since I've been watching MM recently it was an immediate connection) is just entering high school; he was ostracized at his middle school because he was a chuunibyou and introduced himself on the first day by showing the bandage on his arm and claiming it was there to seal his Dragon of Darkness Flame and he was the Master of the Dark Flame (which he totally stole from Yu Yu Hakusho's Hiei). He chose a high school far away so he could start over and act normal, and the show opens with him throwing out his black coat, all his silver chains and black leather clothes, and his sword that he saved up all his money to buy. While doing this, he notices a girl wearing a black dress with ruffles and an eyepatch climb down a rope past his floor from the apartment above. The next day at school, the same girl comes up to him in class and starts babbling a lot of chuunibyou mumbo-jumbo about her Tyrant's Eye throbbing in his direction, then complains that her eye really does hurt, forcing Yuuta to bring her to the nurse's office for eye drops. She starts calling him Dark Flame Master, throwing him off, and insisting that he unite with her. It turns out that she saw him saying his old catch phrase from middle school when he thought he was alone; Yuuta said it one last time and then 'sealed' it from ever being spoken again, but this girl, Rikka Takanashi, happened to hear him and now afflicts him with her chuunibyou-ness. Yuuta tries to go out with the normal kids, but when Rikka loses her wallet and can't get home, his teacher makes him take her since they live close together. It turns out that she's the little sister of the office lady in the apartment above them, though Rikka claims that her sister works for some evil organization that tries to thwart her at every turn. Rikka ends up eating dinner with Yuuta's family (consisting of himself, his mother, and two younger sisters, the middle school-age Kuzuha and the elementary school-age Yumeha) and Yuuta helps her move in, since her sister works late and isn't around. After Rikka insists that his chuunibyou things are cool and aren't garbage, he brings them back inside, though he says it would be a waste to throw them out and he's going to sell them.

I read on the fansub page where I downloaded this that it's a KyoAni work, and it looks it; in particular, the art style reminds me of K-On. In fact, it almost looks like they stole the appearance of the school from K-On, and the character designs look similarly Hayao Miyazaki-ish; Rikka's mannerisms and expressions also remind me a bit of Yui in the anime. Since the art style was among the best points of the many good points of the K-On anime (even if you hate the story, you've gotta admit that that art style was amazing), I wasn't bothered by this, but it was noteworthy how close the two are.

I liked the story and characters so far; Yuuta was a decent example of the put-upon hero of light novel-derived anime (which I'm pretty sure this is) and his sisters and Rikka were all cute. My favorite scenes were in the nurse's office, when Rikka says she's going to prove that her Tyrant's Eye exists and it turns out that she's wearing an eyepatch over a gold contact lens over a perfectly working eye (she's going to ruin her vision like that), and on the train platform when she uses her roller shoes to "take a hit from an enemy" with a cool pose. I'm not sure where the story is going to go, and that worries me a little; all the good light novel-derived anime I can think of (Haruhi, Bakemonogatari, Ore Imo, Haganai) had either established a strong concept by the end of the first episode, or begun a plotline. This show's failure to do either of those isn't necessarily a danger sign, but it does remind me of Denpa Onna, which failed for me partially because of a weak concept and plot, depending on its heroine to magically create stories for it. There are characters besides Rikka, and since Rikka goes to school and everything, unlike Erio, we could actually have connections among them all that could make this at least more interesting than Denpa Onna even without a strong direction, so I'll wait for more. In the meantime, the first episode was a lot of fun and the art was a joy to look at, just as it was when K-On used it before.

[More, July 19th, 2013] I watched Episode 2 of this series, where Rikka's sister Touka is introduced, and wasn't very impressed. I later watched Episodes 3-5 and liked them a lot. It is a very K-On-like series, in that it's mostly pointless and a lot of the jokes shouldn't really be funny but become funny due to the overwhelming cuteness of the characters. In addition to Touka, Episode 2 introduces Kumin Tsuyuri, a second-year who comes to Rikka and Yuuta to see if the stray cat they found is hers. (It isn't.) In Episode 3, Rikka takes a turn for the Haruhi, trying out all the clubs and deciding she doesn't like any of them, then deciding to form her own club. She impresses Yuuta, merges with Kumin's napping club, and calls her friend Sanae Dekomori from the middle school. Shinka Nibutani, a popular girl who Yuuta has had a crush on since the beginning of the series, also joins, though Yuuta can't figure out why. In Episode 4, Nibutani asks to come over, and Yuuta discovers that she's trying to find the Mabinogion, Dekomori's binder, which is actually a printed copy of the blog Nibutani kept back when she herself was a chuunibyou and went under the name "Mori Summer". (Her first name, Shinka, is written with the kanji for "forest", which can also be read as "mori", and the kanji for "summer".) She deleted the blog and is now determined to destroy Dekomori's printed copy, which Dekomori forgot at Yuuta's house. She succeeds, but, as Rikka puts it, Dekomori possesses infinite copies of the Mabinogion, forcing Nibutani to stick around and try to destroy the rest of them as opportunities arise. 

I ended up liking the characters a lot, and several of the jokes were very good. It has that same unassuming feeling as K-On, where you don't expect any kind of cleverness in the humor, and yet it pops up every so often to show that the writers just like low-key, somewhat mellow humor and really aren't lazy hacks. Rikka's persona breaks somewhat in Episode 5, where she's maneuvered by their deceptively friendly homeroom teacher into fighting to pass her math exam in order to keep her club; she talks a little bit like a normal person in this episode, and Yuuta seems to like it. So did I. Dekomori was sort of annoying, especially when she turned out to be some kind of genius, but on the other hand she was a dumbass who hit herself in the face with the balls tied to her twin tails (which she calls "Mjollnir Hammers" and swings around like a pair of bolas), which offset that somewhat. She and Nibutani fight over Nibutani's claim to being Mori Summer, who Dekomori idolizes. Nibutani was sort of a bitch (she had the temerity to call Yuuta a loser when he tried to console her by talking about his own chuunibyou past), but she suffers enough to make it work. Aside from Rikka, Kumin was probably my favorite; in one scene she avoids all of Dekomori's attacks in her sleep, while napping in the center of the magic circle (made of Christmas lights) that Dekomori and Rikka set up on the floor. There's a recurring joke where two characters begin an awesome, earth-shattering battle with giant magical weapons and big explosions, similar to the battles in X, only for us to see that they're really doing something ridiculous, like rolling around on the floor with mops. The animation for these fake battles is surprisingly good and definitely puts X's battles to shame.

Unfortunately, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai ended up on The Anime Network under the terrible title Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions. That title bears no resemblance to the original other than containing the words "love" (koi) and "chuunibyou". It isn't clever. It isn't funny. It doesn't avoid the weird word "chuunibyou", and it doesn't fit the show in the slightest, sounding more like the title of something along the lines of Yume Miru Kusuri or Welcome to the NHK, but with chuunibyou. I don't see what's so bad about the literal translation "Even Chuunibyou Want to Fall in Love" (or "Even though I'm a Chuunibyou, I Still Want to Fall in Love"), which resembles the original and fits the show. It may not be clever or funny and it still doesn't avoid the word "chuunibyou", but it's not clever or funny on account of the original creators, so the translators can't be blamed for that. I detect some of those idiots from ADV at work here. I'd have to say this is even worse than "Heaven's Lost Property", which at least was merely overly literal.

Anyway, I am thinking of getting the rest of the series on fansub to avoid Anime Network. If a DVD set comes out I would buy it.

[12/3/2014] Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai and its sequel are now on Crunchyroll, so yay! I watched most of the rest of the series on fansubs, and it turned out that my fears about it turning into another Denpa Onna were unfounded. Chuu2 had something else up its sleeve after all: a love story.

It turns out that Rikka and Touka’s father died a few years ago, and Rikka adopted her chuunibyou personality as a way of dealing with the loss. Touka was hoping that Yuuta would help Rikka snap out of it, but Yuuta, upon discovering that Rikka wasn’t just being ridiculous and had real, serious reasons for being that way, starts to sympathize with her, causing Touka to get angry and consider him a threat. However, he does discuss things with Rikka a little and move her in a different direction.

Nibutani realizes that Rikka is falling in love with Yuuta, so she starts doing things to get them together as everyone works on the school festival together. The show moves in a romantic direction and does a pretty good job of it, from what I remember, although for some reason it’s all a bit blurry.

I’m considering rewatching the first series on fansubs and then watching the second series on Crunchyroll, because it was actually pretty good. I somehow forgot them in between the time I wrote my second set of thoughts above and a little while ago.

** Wednesday, February 27th, 2013:

Little Busters!: I decided to take a break on Sakurasou no Petto na Kanojo, which has yet to really blow me away, and try this. It comes with the hype of the century behind it, because it's based on a visual novel by Key, makers of Clannad, which I would unhesitatingly place as one of my top five favorite anime ever, and Kanon, which would probably make it into my top twenty (and Air, which I try to forget about, mostly). Much of the staff also worked on Angel Beats, which was also a high-caliber series. 

The main character is Riki Naoe, a mild and somewhat effeminate student who hangs out with his four childhood friends in a group known as the Little Busters. The four friends are Kengo, vice-captain of the kendo team; Masato, a muscle-head who resembles Domon Kasshu from G Gundam; Kyousuke, who is handsome and popular, despite his dorky love for manga and cheesy grand pronouncements; and Rin, Kyousuke's little sister and sort of a tomboy. Ever since childhood, the five of them have been running around and getting into trouble. Kyousuke, who is a year older than the others and in his third year of high school, returns from a job hunt and decides, reflecting upon the future, that he'd like to do something which he can only do in high school, as sort of a final memory with his friends. He decides to form a baseball team. For some reason he wants girls to join, so he asks Rin to hunt some down for him while he feeds her lines through a Bluetooth headset; however, all he accomplishes is getting Rin beat up by the captain of the girls' softball team. The first episode ends with Naoe going up to the roof and finding a cute girl huddled in a pile of candy under the water tank, claiming that it rained candy on her.

Unlike Clannad, the first episode of Little Busters didn't blow me away, but it definitely showed the seed of becoming another excellent Key work. The characters reminded me of Clannad's more than Angel Beats's; in the interplay between the five Little Busters, you could see that Rin played the role of Kyou and Masato the role of Sunohara, while Kengo took the part of Tomoya as the sarcastic commentator and Kyosuke took the role of Tomoya as the instigator, though his personality was more similar to Yusuke Yoshino and Akio Furukawa. (It even sounds like he's voiced by Hikaru Midorikawa, who voiced Yoshino.) Interestingly, the only one without an obvious Clannad analogue was Naoe—he's actually more like the effeminate, gentle heroes of Yosuga no Sora and Mashiro-Iro Symphony than the sarcastic and socially skilled Yuuichi and Tomoya. (Maybe Naoe is Nagisa?) It seems like future episodes have the Little Busters recruit a bunch of cute, quirky girls to their team; I'm wondering if it's Naoe who accomplishes this, or if the other boys have something to do with it (it's probably not Rin, based on how badly she messed up in the first episode). 

The animation was as good as always, though it too didn't blow me away quite like Clannad. It seems like Itaru Hinoue and Na-Ga both worked on the character designs, which you can sort of see because some of the characters—Kyousuke, Kengo, Masato, and Rin—look like total Na-Ga designs with their spiky hair and narrow eyes, while others—Naoe, Kudryavka (who appears later), and most of the other unrevealed characters from the credits, look like total Hinoue designs with their round faces and huge eyes. (Not to mention all the crazy outfits that the other girls wear.) This somewhat leaves a feeling that you can see the seams in the show, but it does make the designs a bit more varied, which could end up adding some visual interest (I can't say for sure because almost all the characters who appear in the first episode—with the exceptions of Naoe, the softball team captain, and the girl Naoe finds on the roof, none of whom appear for very long—look like Na-Ga designs). 

I have high hopes for Little Busters, and so far it has shown the signs of living up to them; in both its comedy scenes and its dramatic scenes it looks like it will give us an experience on the level of Clannad without just rehashing Clannad—familiar enough to evoke its predecessor, but different enough to stand out. I like the decision to include important male characters from the get-go; even though I can't get through my day without my moe girls, I do appreciate it when shows have interesting male characters, in the plural, with traps not counting as male. In some weird cases, like Working!!, I even end up liking the male characters more than the female characters.

Kiss x Sis: I've read about twenty chapters of this manga by Mahoromatic's Bow Ditama, and I don't think I'll read any more, so it seemed like a good time to write about it. I downloaded it because I knew from the title that it was about sisters, my thing, but it turned out that they weren't little sisters, but rather older sisters (twins), and they're stepsisters, not real sisters. I guess I just got too spoiled by Bakemonogatari and forgot that most writers don't have the guts to make the main character's full-blood genuine bona-fide little sisters be in love with him.

But Kiss x Sis makes up for its lack of blood with tons and tons of sex. The main character, Keita Suminoe, is pursued romantically by his two older stepsisters Ako and Riko. They became family over ten years ago when Keita's father married Ako and Riko's mother, and ever since then, Ako and Riko have been head-over-heels in love with Keita, egged on by both parents. Since they're stepsisters, they actually can be in a relationship with and get married to Keita, so the main problem is that there are two of them, and there can be only one. Most chapters involve one or the other of the two sisters manipulating the situation so that Keita comes to the edge of having sex with her; at first Keita tries to tell himself he only sees them as sisters, though he admits that that facade has been crumbling recently, and after a few incidents that count as one step away from sex under almost any definition, he starts to fall. 

The art is very cute, and that makes the erotic scenes quite nice, but they get old after about ten chapters (sooner if you're not inclined that way), and there's really nothing else to this series. Around Chapter 15, new characters are introduced, but nothing really changes except that it gets closer to tired hentai plotlines. The characters have rather blurry, indistinct personalities. Keita is painfully generic, not even at the level of To-Love-Ru's Rito. Ako is supposed to be the motherly, housewifey one and Riko is supposed to be the wild, perverted one, but they never distinguish themselves from each other to a great extent. Riko's sex scenes tend to be a little more fetishy, but that and their appearances are the only way to tell them apart. (It took me about four chapters to get straight which was which, and it's not that they look overwhelmingly similar.) Because Ako and Riko are so flat, their erotic scenes get stale quickly because I don't feel a connection with them that makes me want to see them in an erotic scene. 

The author has some weird urine fetish; twice now he's had creepy urination scenes that were supposed to be erotic somehow, but I'm not into that. He also threw in an awful chapter where an evil gym teacher catches Keita, Ako, and Riko doing something sexual in the gym shed and blackmails them so he can do netorare, feeling up Ako and Riko right in front of Keita. Keita records his threats so they can be played for the police and they escape, then go home and have sex. Now Keita's homeroom teacher is trying to break up Keita, Ako, and Riko because she's a virgin so she has some weird prudishness about the whole thing. 

Ako and Riko are cute enough in appearance, and if they had interesting personalities or if the story were interesting, I wouldn't mind that they're older sisters and not little sisters. But nothing about this series was interesting except the sex scenes (that didn't involve urine). That makes it basically a hentai manga, except I've actually read hentai manga—and sister-based hentai manga, at that--with more interesting characters. For some reason Ayana Taketatsu plays Ako in the anime, which I thought was a little weird because she usually doesn't play that kind of character. Maybe having a good actress can make a boring character more interesting.

[Update, 6/19/2013: I watched about ten minutes of the first anime episode on Fakku the other day. It was about as good as the manga (i.e. not), but Ako did become much cuter when voiced by Ayana Taketatsu. She played the part a little more sweetly than Mio Isurugi or Kirino, although not quite as sweet as Azu-nyan. Riko's voice actress wasn't bad either, although I think someone whose voice was a little more husky would have fit better. But that was about the only good thing about it, and also the tentacle rape scene that they added at the beginning for no reason.]

** Thursday, January 17th, 2013:

My first unfair first impressions of the new year. After finishing with Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari, I couldn't find anything that looked interesting in Crunchyroll, so I was watching Mashiro-iro Symphony again, but the stupid app won't let me watch Episode 6 of that, so instead I watched:

Upotte!: One of those weird moe anthropomorphism series like Afuganisu-tan or Bincho-tan or that other one where the girls all represent soft drinks (Aki-kan?), but here the girls are all assault rifles. Mixes moe, weaponry, and weird gun-related metaphors for sexual things in an unappetizing stew that I can't figure out why they spent so much money getting nice animation and music for. The character designs are pretty cute, but the characters themselves are pretty much harem show stereotypes with random traits that somehow relate to the gun they represent thrown in. The nominal main character is a new teacher at the weird gun girls' school, who sees the main heroine FNC's (from the makers of the FN-P90) underwear, which is a thong, because the gun has a skeleton stock. FNC somehow becomes sexually attracted to him and there's all sorts of weird, awkward scenes where she's about to "blow her hammer" or something, which I guess is the gun equivalent of having an orgasm, and fantasizes about being gripped and fired by the teacher's big hands. You wouldn't think I would find stuff like that objectionable after how much I loved Nisemonogatari's tooth-brushing episode, but I guess it all depends on the writer and the situation; when it's an adorable character like Karen-chan instead of a personality-less moe anthropomorphization of an assault rifle, and I have trust that the writers weren't just making a cheap grab for more viewers, the light I view it in is totally different. 

The whole rifle thing was really weird and didn't add any interest for me, since I'm not a gun otaku; some of the scenes also looked disturbingly close to Gunslinger Girl, in which the girls were assuredly not moe girls having a fun time with their friends in middle school, so that all made the show pretty hard to enjoy. The "jokes" were all pretty standard-issue; when FNC gets mad at the main character (whose name never seems to be mentioned during the first episode) for mentioning her thong, instead of punching him, she shoots him with an assault rifle and he goes to the hospital with bandages around random places. I expect the show goes on to do all the boring standard-issue plotlines like the cultural festival, the sports festival, the Christmas episode, and the beach episode, but I won't be around to see them, because I did not enjoy the first episode at all. I kept checking how much time was left to see if it was almost over; the first time only fifteen minutes had passed, so I started to get bored about halfway through.

Medaka Box: Speaking of Nisemonogatari, Medaka Box! This show is based on a manga written by Nisio Isin; the anime is produced by Gainax. You'd think that a collaboration between Gainax, one of the best animation studios around and producer of Eva, FLCL, and Mahoromatic, and Nisio Isin, the genius writer who created Karen and Tsukihi, could not possibly fail.

Well, I wouldn't say Medaka Box failed with its first episode; it was certainly better than Upotte. But it wasn't as good as I had hoped, given that we are talking about the man who created the peerless Monogatari series and the quite good Zaregoto series. The main character is Medaka Kurokami, a large-breasted and superhumanly energetic high school girl who just got elected Student Council President with 98% of the vote despite being a first-year. As a fulfillment of a campaign promise, she installs a suggestion box into which students can put request cards; any request will be fulfilled by Medaka personally. Her childhood friend Zenkichi gets dragged into her first request, to clear some third-year thugs out of the kendo building, as he seemingly always gets dragged into everything she does. Medaka beats up the thugs with her superpowers and then makes a grandiose speech about how the thugs clearly were once good boys and had lost their way, and forces them to do hard kendo training. The original requester, Hyuuga, is a foul-tempered kendo master who came to the school specifically because its kendo club had been suspended and he could do as he pleased; he isn't happy with Medaka's solution and goes and beats up all the reformed thugs, as well as kidnapping Zenkichi. Zenkichi agrees with Hyuuga that the thugs are just a bunch of thugs, but he says the both of them are wrong and Medaka is right, as she always is, and punches out Hyuuga before Hyuuga can use his kendo mastery. Medaka discovers from Zenkichi's friend Shiranui that Hyuuga made the request, and goes to straighten him out after Shiranui submits a request to improve Hyuuga's terrible personality. The episode ends with Hyuuga becoming a kendo tutor for the thugs and Zenkichi agreeing to join Medaka's student council, which he had been avoiding.

I feel like Medaka Box touched on a lot of the themes that Nisio Isin frequently uses—the perfect super genius who is capable of anything, how the existence of this person affects those around her, how the super genius views herself as not that extraordinary—but didn't back them up with the same kind of clever writing that we usually see. Maybe it will happen if I give it a chance. Apparently it shapes up into a fighting series as it moves on, though. Since it was a manga, everything is exaggerated: the characters' appearances--Medaka has massive breasts that she exposes the tops of in every outfit she wears, and during an early scene she randomly strips to her underwear while alone with Zenkichi; the school, which is one of those massive city-like schools with top-level facilities; the problems, like having a psychotic rogue kendo master as a student; and the power of the student council. Recently I've been more partial to shows that hold back on this sort of exaggeration, but I did once enjoy such things, so it's not impossible I could come back around.

As for the characters, one episode is just too little to tell, so they could turn out to be interesting. Medaka reminds me of Haruhi Suzumiya's energy, crossed with Tsubasa Hanekawa's perfection and belief that everyone can achieve her level with hard work, crossed with Karen Araragi's passion for justice and do-gooding. Shockingly, she is voiced by Aki Toyosaki; I did not hear even the slightest hint of Yui Hirasawa or Jun Nagase in her voice while I was watching. Zenkichi feels more like Ore Imo's Kyousuke than Monogatari's Koyomi or Zaregoto's Ii-chan; he is somewhat jealous of Medaka's perfection and how everything comes easily to her, but at the same time believes that she is always right and always does what's best. The only other character so far is Zenkichi's friend Shiranui, a small and cute blue-haired girl voiced by Emiri Katou (Mayoi-chan!) who seems to be the comic relief character.

I'm not a huge fan of the art style, which looks too Fist of the North Star-ish for my tastes, but I guess that style is fitting for the fighting series that this later becomes. I wasn't very encouraged that the first episode is already using overly dramatic still shots to express action, during Medaka's fight with the kendo thugs. I wish they could have stolen Upotte's character designer and animation budget.

Hen-Zemi: A manga authored by Tagro, who I knew only as the guy who did the omake in Genshiken where he described how he was the real-life inspiration for Madarame. If Madarame drew a manga, though, I'm not sure it would be quite this perverted (after all, he couldn't even stand the S&M DVDs he bought to hide the cosplay pictures of Saki). Nanako Matsutaka is a college student who joins an "abnormal/perverted physiology seminar" because the boy she has a crush on, Komugi, is taking it. But she isn't perverted enough for the professor's taste, and is given makeup assignments when he complains that her work is too much like a women's magazine. Komugi, on the other hand, is the star pupil because of his fetishes and lack of morals. He's a liar, a cheat, and a panty thief; in the first chapter, he tricks Nanako into taking off her panties and giving them to him, saying that it's for a seminar project on the habits of panty thieves, when it's actually part of his personal rampage to steal twenty pairs of panties a day.

There are some other characters too, but I've only read four chapters so I can't say much about them. Nanako is cute and is a long-suffering normal girl type of character, somewhat like Ichiroh's Nanako. In the anime version she is voiced by Kana Hanazawa, which is another bonus point even when I can't hear it. The art style is pretty cute too. But it can get sort of disgusting, like in the second chapter when Komugi suggests that Nanako work at a feces farm to make money—he claims the people eat the feces and demand special diets so the feces will be to their taste. That sort of thing doesn't really tweak my sense of humor. I might read a few more chapters, but if they don't reclaim the promise of the first one, I'll probably quit.

Saki Achiga-hen Episode of Side A: The title is really hard to remember and nonsensical.

I did actually watch the show, and it wasn't bad. I picked this at random from Crunchyroll because the art looked cute and the next episode of Bakemonogatari hadn't been opened yet. The animation is quite good and the character designs are very moe moe. The show begins with small town sixth graders Shizuno and Ako meeting and befriending Nodoka, a transfer student who likes dressing in frills and pink. While talking, they somehow discover that Nodoka has an interest in mahjong, so they take her to Achiga, the town's one and only fancy girls' school. The school used to have an amazing mahjong club that beat the local champions, but the club atrophied and now the room is used by Akado, one of the former members and now a college student, to teach children to play. Nodoka also meets Kuro, a middle schooler and the best player among the children, and the four of them form a strong friendship among themselves and with Akado. Akado ends up getting recruited to play mahjong professionally, and the informal classes break up. Nodoka and Shizuno both go to Achiga for middle school, while Ako goes to another school and plans to attend the high school whose mahjong team is the local champion. Nodoka ends up moving away because of her mother's work, and Shizuno moves on towards high school at Achiga alone.

One day, Shizu sees Nodoka on TV, playing mahjong for her high school and doing very well at it. This reinvigorates Shizu, and she goes to the old clubroom, where she meets Kuro, who has been cleaning the room this whole time, hoping someone would return. Shizu manages to convince Ako to go to Achiga for high school and form a club with her so they can go to the nationals and play against Nodoka.

It probably sounds like I watched several episodes, but this was actually all in the first episode. The intricate setup and good pacing was a definite point in Saki Achiga-hen's favor. The characters were all cute, and we came to know them in a natural way through the narrative of the episode. In particular, Shizu is majorly hyper; we know this because she's always climbing, running, yelling, circling, pacing, and twitching, not because the voiceover narration told us. Kuro is totally played by Kana Hanazawa (always a good thing). The show reminded me a bit of K-On crossed with Hikaru no Go. It's always a good thing to remind me of K-On, and what I read of Hikaru no Go was pretty good, so that's all a compliment to Saki Achiga-hen. I hope it can maintain a nice pace and interesting writing for a while longer; if so, I will probably watch some more of it.

** Thursday, September 27th, 2012:

Another visit to my mother's means more unfair first impressions, this time of--

Papa no Iukoto o Kikinasai!: The title literally means "Listen to what Papa is telling you!" but is translated on Crunchyroll as "Listen to me, Girls, I'm your Father!". The show is sort of a weird cross of slice of life, harem, and loli (when I say "loli" I mean shows like Rizelmine and Kodomo no Jikan whose only reason to exist is loli). The main character is Yuuta Segawa, a freshman in college who was raised by his sister, Yuri, after their parents died when he was young. Yuri is now married to Shingo Takanashi and has a daughter, Hina, with him; she also acts as mother to his daughters from previous marriages, Sora and Miu. Yuri asks Yuuta to watch the children for her and Shingo while they go on a business trip / honeymoon. On the way, though, the plane crashes and both of them go missing. The Takanashi relatives want to split up the three girls, but the girls can't bear it, so Yuuta offers to let them live with him in his tiny one-room apartment.

I watched about six episodes of the series, and so far, it's all been about Yuuta and the girls getting used to their new way of life. The transition is particularly difficult for Sora, who has had a crush on Yuuta ever since she first met him, when Yuri introduced him to Shingo and the girls. There's an unnecessary amount of Yuuta stumbling in on Sora naked and getting slapped. Sora is fourteen, so her nudity is no more disturbing than the Eva girls, although nowadays I usually like the girls used for fanservice to be at least sixteen, and prefer no nudity for loli characters (even if they're really seven hundred years old). Guess I'm just getting old. [Monday, December 10th, 2012: I was totally lying to myself here. I'm fine with naked lolis; it was just these lolis and this situation I wasn't that thrilled with. Bakemonogatari made me realize this was so.] Miu, who is ten, tends to wear outfits that show a lot of skin when she's at home. Hina is only three, so she gets left out of the fanservice. If Yuuta were actually interested, it might be disturbing, but he only seems to think of the girls as his beloved nieces. His weird, fat, bespectacled club leader seems to be a lolicon, however. Yuuta decides early on that he must never meet the girls, but he eventually speaks on the phone with both Miu and Hina. Yuuta's friend Nimura has met the girls and helps Yuuta by covering for him in various ways; at this point, Yuuta's prospective girlfriend, club sempai Raika Oda, hasn't met them and doesn't know anything about them. 

I went back and forth on this show. The loli aspect probably didn't bother me as much as it should have (Sora's strong resemblance to Haruhi Suzumiya probably helps make her look older; it's hard to think of Haruhi as a loli). There were some truly adorable moments, such as Yuuta and Sora's first meeting and several of Hina's scenes, as well as the scene in Episode 3 when the girls try to cook for Yuuta and screw it up. I also liked Raika, who speaks in monotone and ruins all of the club leader's schemes by saying all her lines with no emotion at all. But there was too much of Yuuta seeing Sora naked and getting slapped. I guess Sora was supposed to be tsundere, but she wasn't a very good one. She felt much like a ripoff of Naru. Miu, who always tried to embarrass Sora by hinting about her crush, was too much like a ripoff of Kitsune. Hina, though, was cute, and her inclusion made the series feel sort of like Bunny Drop with lolis. 

Masshiro-iro Symphony: A Kanon ripoff, I avoided watching this forever because I thought it was going to be like Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi. Turns out I was missing out; Masshiro-iro Symphony, at least in the three episodes that I watched, was one of the only Kanon ripoffs I've seen that could turn out to be as good as Yosuga no Sora. It might even be better.

Shingo Uryu, his sister Sakuno, and his friend Hayata are all students at the failing Kagamidai School, which is attempting to merge its students with nearby Yuihime Girl's Academy, nicknamed Yuijo. The problem is that Kagamidai is coed, while Yuijo is for girls only. Shingo, Sakuno, and Hayata are all members of a test class of students from both schools that is being used to try out the idea of the merger. In the best opening scene I've seen since Yosuga no Sora, Sakuno gets lost in the picturesque old district of town while coming back from grocery shopping. She calls Shingo to come find her, but her cell phone runs out of batteries and it starts to rain. A girl named Sena Airi comes along, shares her umbrella with Sakuno, and calls Shingo on her cell phone. She's also lost, so Shingo guides them to a nearby park and meets up with them. Sena is very polite and well-spoken, and of course beautiful; she and Sakuno become friends and plan to meet up again. Later, on the first day of class, Shingo and Sakuno discover that Sena is the daughter of Yuijo's director, and is completely opposed to the merger. At the very least, Sena says, she won't stand for having boys in the school. Shingo and Sakuno are shocked that she's so different from when they met her.

Many of the girls agree with Sena, but not all. In particular, Sana and Angela, nicknamed Ange, who's a maid for some reason, welcome the Kagamidai students, including the boys. A third-year, Miu, who is well-respected by everyone and is like an older sister to Sana, also welcomes Shingo. Still, Shingo is depressed, until Sakuno tells him that he's good with girls and that he should just be himself. During a cooking class that forms part of the school's "feminine studies" curriculum, Shingo distinguishes himself as a good cook, and the other boys, following his lead, make themselves useful to the girls and win some respect. They also show their worth by eating all the food, since everyone made way too much by mistake and eating all of it is required to get a grade. He gets himself chosen as class representative alongside Sena and does his best to charm her, although she resists strongly. With help from Miu, Sana, and Sakuno, Shingo gets Sena to walk home with the group; on the way, she tells Sakuno that she somehow feels even more uncomfortable around Shingo than around other boys. Shingo starts to break Sena's armour when he volunteers to take on a huge stack of student representative work so she can keep an engagement, in return for help studying for midterms. While grocery shopping with Sakuno, Sana, and Ange, Shingo happens to see Sena bargain shopping and talking to herself; when she notices him, she freezes and seems ready to freak out. That's where Episode 3 ends.

Unlike Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate, there was only the standard amount of hyper-realism in Masshiro-iro Symphony, similar to the amount in Kanon or Yosuga no Sora. The animation and art were really beautiful, especially the design of the old part of town, which looks like a Taisho-era Japanese village, with stone walls and roads and old wooden houses. I loved the nighttime scenery, and the first scene definitely qualified as one of the subtle, compelling opening scenes that I described in my thoughts on Yosuga no Sora, that compelled me to keep watching that show. Sakuno is adorable, a mellow, devoted little sister, and so far my favorite character. I love her soft, inexpressive voice and her believable relationship with her brother. Sena is hard to like in these early episodes, but her first scene gives you enough to keep watching, wondering when we're going to see that side of her again. I also like that she dislikes Shingo for a substantive reason—she doesn't want the merger to go through and especially doesn't want boys in the school—rather than a stupid reason like that he saw her panties (although the show threw in a bunch of unnecessary scenes of Shingo seeing Sena's panties to hammer it in—an unfortunate, and rare, misstep). The other characters haven't been developed much yet, but Miu seems pretty cute too—she has a cute voice, and she runs a club devoted to nursing injured wild animals back to health and releasing them. 

I liked Masshiro-iro Symphony much more than I expected to, and will probably watch more. It's really confusing to have Sena and Sana in the same show, though.

** Wednesday, September 19th, 2012:

Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate: Like Kokoro Connect, I ended up watching this because I downloaded the ending theme, "Kaze no Naka no Primrose", and really liked it. I also loved the title of the show (it translates to Love, Elections, and Chocolate; I just like the rhythm and the sound of the words, in either language but especially in Japanese). Unfortunately, it's on The Anime Network. Yes, that stupid 24-hour anime channel that ADV set up before they died and took their brand of hipster doofus anime marketing, where every show was made to look like Excel Saga II, with them. The TV channel is gone, but it still has a website where it streams certain titles (mostly from Sentai Filmworks, who bought ADV), and as if I needed another reason to hate them, it's not free. It has a class system divided into three levels: scum, member, and subscriber. Scum only get to watch one episode of Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate; only subscribers get to watch the rest of them. A lot of the shows on The Anime Network are also on Crunchyroll, but not this one.

Anyway, I watched the first episode. I had read that Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate was based on a visual novel, but even if I hadn't, I would've known early on. It starts with a weirdly dark opening scene where a girl spies on some sort of shady deal going down between two entities that she calls "General Affairs" and "Security". It turns out these are two divisions of the political machine of the gigantic school that the characters attend. This girl ends up getting run over by the people she was spying on, and her camera's memory card is crushed. The next scene shows a tsundere childhood friend going and doing vaguely sexual things to wake up her childhood friend, Yuki Ojima. The tsundere childhood friend is Chisato Sumiyoshi. She slaps him when she sees his morning erection. Where have we seen this before? [Sunday, January 6th, 2013: This joke is so old it was actually in Eva, during the "perfect world" of Episode 26.]

Chisato and Yuki are members of the Shokken, a club that researches food (sort of like a food criticism club), along with the friendly Mifuyu Kiba, the quiet and odd Michiru Morishita, yaoi boy Oboro Yumeshima, and some other girls who all look young and are hyper and hyper-realistic. One of them is some sort of candy mad scientist. The others reminded me of Chikaru's random, crazy cute girl followers from Strawberry Panic, in looks and personality (or lack thereof, beyond being hyper). When Satsuki Shinonome, the treasurer of the student council, announces her candidacy for president, she promises to shut down any clubs that don't add anything to the school, including the Shokken. The members try to find another candidate to support, but the only one available is some weirdo in a henohenomoheji mask that everyone somehow thinks is his real face. Chisato refuses to support him because he's going around handing out coupons to win votes, which she finds immoral. The club members, at the suggestion of their drunk teacher Hazuki Shinonome (the older sister of their main enemy), decide to form a campaign and put forward their own candidate for president. They know it's a long shot, but figure it's better than bowing down quietly. Everyone chooses Yuki as the candidate. 

I wasn't that impressed with the initial setup, and I didn't like some of the weird things they threw in, like the mask guy, or another guy with a propeller on his head. Specifically, it was annoying that Yuki points them out, but no one else can see them. I would've rather they just left it as a cartoonish weirdness that no one notices if they had to have it. Once the story began, though, it seemed like it might go somewhere. The giant political machine of the school was totally hyper-realistic, but if they can build a good story around it, I'll ignore that, just like I did for Mari Mite. The first episode implies that some of the students are on scholarships and have to work in a factory to earn their tuition, which I thought was sort of weird and dark—a backwards division into unequal classes, just like the one that The Anime Network has. I have no problem with Crunchyroll's division into first-class and coach, but limiting most of a series to subscribers when there's no DVD set is just too much. It wouldn't even bother me if it were meant as a preview of the DVD set, but there isn't one at this time. I will avoid this site in the future. The show itself is in limbo. I wasn't blown away, but I was willing to give it at least a few more chances.

** Friday, August 3rd, 2012:

Kokoro Connect: I downloaded the opening to this show, "Paradigm" by Eufonius, and it was too adorable! Based on the title, I suspected the show would also be really cute and decided to look for it. I found it on Crunchyroll, and it's not exactly what I expected (I expected maybe something along the lines of K-On, or possibly a Kanon ripoff), but it seems to be pretty good anyway.

The show follows a group of five students who attend an elite school where everyone has to be in a club. All of the main characters wanted to be in clubs that were defunct or nonexistent, except for one character who just couldn't decide on a club, and another who got in a fight with the president of the club she joined. Since they couldn't be in any other club, they formed the "Student Cultural Studies Club", which is basically just an excuse for them to sit around and have fun. (Like the SOS Brigade, Rinjinbu, Light Music Club, et al.) One day two of the members report that they switched bodies the previous night, and soon all five members have switched bodies with another member. Some sort of supernatural entity calling itself Heartseed takes over the body of their teacher and explains that it's causing the body switches and that they'll happen at random until it gets tired of watching them and leaves.

Body switching isn't exactly original, and the first episode did a lot of having the characters explain each other's personalities out loud so the audience would find out what they're like, which was sort of annoying. On the other hand, the animation is really good and the character designs are very nice. There are actually male characters—in fact, two of the five are men: pro-wrestling fan Taichi Yaegashi, who's described as a tennen and seems to have a thing about helping and protecting others, and the wannabe playboy Yoshifumi Aoki, who has an obsessive crush on Yui Kiriyama, one of the female members who is feminine and secretly scared of men, but also practices karate. The other two female members are Himeko Inaba, a forbidding and bad-tempered girl who joined the computer club, but fought with the president and left, and Iori Nagase, a cute and playful girl who loves touching and hugging others. Iori is referred to as the president in the first episode, so maybe she's the one who brought them all together. She couldn't decide which club to join so she just let her homeroom teacher pick one at random, but it hasn't been explained why she left that club and joined up with the rest of the cast.

The show does some of the usual things that happen in body switching situations—all sorts of hijinks that happen when people have switched bodies, and a certain amount of awkwardness over going to the bathroom or the boys' desire to explore female bodies while they've got one. It also does some surprisingly sensitive things, such as when Himeko expresses her worries that their lives could all be destroyed by this, or the scene where Iori (in Aoki's body) muses on how an identity is constructed and whether they'll lose theirs from repeatedly switching into other people's bodies. It seems that the majority of the show is going to be about the club members finding things out about each other and helping each other; by Episode 3, the boys discover that Yui is afraid of men, and when Taichi switches bodies with her, he helps her to get over it by kicking his own body in the groin to show her how much it hurts. (It makes sense in context—sort of.)

So far, my favorite character is Iori—since she's voiced by Aki Toyosaki I was expecting her to be more of a ditz, but she actually reminds me a lot of Hanasaku Iroha's Ohana, with just a pinch of her seiyuu-mate, K-On's Yui. She eats chips with sugar tongs, for some reason. She's a fun, lively character, and Episode 3, where she wasn't around much, felt a little less fun (though there was still a lot going on with the Yui subplot). I'm looking forward to finding out what her deal is. She seems to like Taichi, but she is now pursued romantically by the class representative, Fujiyama, who seems to be a lesbian rapist. In Episode 1 Fujiyama found Taichi in Iori's body fondling Iori's breasts and went into lesbian rape mode; Iori in Taichi's body came to interrupt everything, and in Episode 3, Himeko sets up Taichi as Fujiyama's romantic rival. I loved the end of Episode 2, when Fujiyama comes in to ask for volunteers for something and Iori dives behind her desk to hide. I also like Himeko, and Taichi could be a really good character as long as the show remembers not to let him win too easily. He's sort of a Key hero with the cluelessness of the hero from a 90's harem show.

During the first three episodes, Kokoro Connect has been pretty good. It has some flaws, but as long as it plays to its strengths, it can probably overcome those. One of its strengths is moe, by the way. Iori, as well as that opening, is too cute! Yui and Himeko are pretty cute too, and Taichi even has a cute little sister. But another one of its strengths is that it does well on both the light side—the humor and fun interactions—as well as the dark side of drama. The art and atmosphere set up both sides perfectly, and while Yui's story in Episode 3 felt really quick and somewhat lacking in impact, I also really appreciated how naturally the characters behaved; nobody yelled or cried or screamed, and when they said things, they sounded honest and not at all over-the-top. 

[On Episodes 4-6, written Sunday, November 4th, 2012] It stayed pretty cute, but some of the problems got out of hand. The most glaring example was Iori's back story, which was a huge disappointment. During Episode 4, she and Taichi begin to think about going out. At the end of Episode 4, Heartseed takes control of Iori's body and makes her jump off a bridge. As she lays in the hospital, he appears in their teacher's body to tell them that they can choose who will die with Iori's body, and he will make the switch. Taichi volunteers, but Iori herself says that it's only right that she die with her own body. After emotional farewells with everyone, the group tells Heartseed that Iori has chosen to die with her own body. Heartseed then reveals that Iori will be fine. Rather than being angry, everyone is relieved. 

That wasn't so bad. Actually, it was pretty good. Iori's farewell scenes with everyone were quite touching. I won't say that it went to hell in Episode 6, but the weaknesses I mentioned above became harder to ignore and took away my will to watch the show. It was mainly a particular scene, where Iori makes Taichi hear her secret before she'll agree to go out with him. She tells him about her numerous stepfathers and how she learned from one of them that if she changed her personality to fit the expectations of others, it would be easier for her to get by in life. So her big, dark secret is that she claims to have no personality of her own and live her whole life behind a mask. We're just told this; we don't see any evidence of it or any way that it could possibly affect Taichi's desire to go out with her. When Taichi doesn't see the problem and responds to her protest of "But I don't have my own personality and live my life behind a mask" with a laugh, I was laughing alongside him. There were other big moments that really should have been handled with more impact, but were instead anemically narrated by the characters, but this was the most major misstep.

Heartseed changes his game after making Iori jump off the bridge, and makes everyone fall prey at random to the uncontrollable urge to fulfill their hidden desires. We first see this when Himeko suddenly starts stripping and sits on Taichi's lap when the two of them are alone in the clubroom. The body switching story was the "hit random" chapter, and this is the "kizu random" chapter. It seems like the story will be easier to advance like this, so it might end up getting better, but I just didn't feel like watching the show anymore. The habit of having the characters explain things to us instead of actually showing it to us made everything feel very dead. I ended up going over to Papa Kiki and then to Mashiro-Iro Symphony because I didn't feel like watching anymore of Kokoro Connect. But that opening is still absurdly adorable.

Myself; Yourself: After I came up with the parody of mediocre Kanon ripoffs Beikon Iro no Kiseki, I decided that I wanted to watch a mediocre Kanon ripoff. Myself; Yourself had a good opening and a semicolon, so I watched it. (The semicolon is the most unappreciated punctuation.)

The main character, Sana, is moving back to his old hometown after leaving behind his childhood friends Aoi, Shuri and Shusuke, and Nanaka. Aoi has developed huge breasts and Shuri and Shusuke are the same as ever, but Sana ends up getting slapped by Nanaka because he doesn't recognize her. For some reason, she is pissed at him and won't even speak to him. By the end of the second episode, Nanaka has overheard Sana playing the song she wrote for his farewell party and performed on her violin when he thought he was alone in the music room, and has started to lighten up a little. Nanaka was the one that Sana had a crush on as a kid, and he came back into town hoping they could get together, but the writers, showing their basic competence, did not make that happen. 

Myself; Yourself is no Kanon and it's no Haganai, but it's also no Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi. The dialogue and interactions did not have that forced, fake feel to them that those of Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi and Akane Iro ni Somaru Saka did. Shuri and Shusuke aren't the most interesting characters, but they're not terrible; they're just standard issue crazy background characters. I was glad that Shusuke wasn't the requisite perverted friend character since that's usually what any male friend of the lead is in a show like this. I liked seeing actual conflict in the story and was somewhat interested to find out why Nanaka was so pissed at Sana. The brightest spot was Aoi, though. They threw a bunch of different character types together in her—the clumsy ditz, the book lover, the sweet, domestic-minded girl—and it all worked out to make her pretty fun to watch. I loved the scene in the bookstore where Sana goes to pick up a book that Aoi loved, and Aoi can't stop herself from telling him all about it, but courteously tells him to cover his ears to avoid spoilers. She then tells him everything that happens, getting very animated, but all Sana can hear is a high-pitched buzzing (her voice is very high-pitched). She's also very cute in appearance: short and a meganekko, but with a substantial bust. Nanaka looks a bit more generic and bishoujo game-y, but still isn't bad, and I also thought Asami Hoshino, who helps out Sana with his student council duties, was pretty cute. (Shusuke nominates Sana for class representative because the teacher is going to pick him if he doesn't find someone; Shuri seconds the nomination, thinking that since Nanaka is the female representative, they might be able to reestablish their relationship.)

Myself; Yourself was decent in the first two episodes and I've got no objection to watching a few more. 

** Tuesday, June 21st, 2012:

Doujin Work: Highly reminiscent of Comic Party, this show follows Najimi Osana (her name in Japanese order is the terrible pun Osana Najimi, i.e. osananajimi, "childhood friend"), who decides to become a doujinshi author to make money. Her friend Tsuyuri introduces her to the craft, and her creepy childhood friend Justice runs around making a lot of noise with his little girl friend Sora (no explanation of her presence is offered in the first two episodes; she seems to have a crush on Justice). The first two episodes weren't bad, but I could see this going south very fast, given how many truly great and quite good shows have pulled off this concept with more flair and skill. (Genshiken and Lucky Star, as well as the aforementioned Comic Party, which had one quite good manga adaptation and was otherwise pretty mediocre. Doujin Work could actually surpass Comic Party.) The show has a very nineties feel to it; the situation comedy, hyper-realistic characters, and the character types used remind me a lot of an older show. (It also reminds me a lot of Ichiroh, but again, not as much flair.) The art isn't bad looking, though, and some of the jokes have been pretty funny. I especially liked Episode 1, when Najimi notices Tsuyuri yawning and asks, trying to embarrass her, if she was up late doing something dirty. Tsuyuri, who of course was working on a doujin, says it is pretty dirty and asks if Najimi wants to do it with her. (After Najimi asks whether she has a partner or does it by herself.) Najimi freaks out, and it just gets worse when Tsuyuri offers to pay her. Also, each episode is only fifteen minutes long including opening and ending sequences, so just when it feels like it might be getting stale, it's over. It's sort of like that episode of Seinfeld where George starts leaving the room right after telling a funny joke, trying to exit on a high note.

I wouldn't say I have super high hopes for Doujin Work in the future, but if it manages to stay reasonably entertaining for its whole run, I'll be pretty satisfied. Also, since the episodes are only fifteen minutes, I was able to watch one and then watch an episode of Sankarea in the same night, which was pretty nice.

More, Thursday August 16th, 2012: Doujin Work has stayed pretty much the same. It has its bright spots and its incredibly bland spots. It defines the phrase "there's not much depth" in a way that people who level that accusation at K-On and Lucky Star couldn't even begin to imagine.

Since Disc 1, we've been introduced to Hoshi-kun, the one idiot who bought Najimi's book in Episode 4 (because he has a crush on her, not because it's any good) and Kaneru Nido, a twenty-four-year-old OL who loves to draw doujinshi, but is terrible at it. She becomes Najimi's "rival" since Najimi is petty and declares it to be so. I like Tsuyuri, who has become the show's deadpan snark-master and troublemaker, and Kaneru, who, unlike Najimi, draws doujinshi because she loves it and works hard to improve. Kaneru is also sort of a ditz and believes that Hoshi-kun and Justice are in a yaoi relationship, and she likes to play with Sora. In fact, it occurred to me as I was watching Episode 9 (several minutes ago) that the show would be better if Kaneru were the main character and Najimi were the haughty, annoying rival character like Kozue Takanashi in Ichiroh. Kaneru's ditziness, earnestness, and slightly boyish voice are all cute, and she actually loves doujinshi, whereas Najimi only draws them because she's an idiot and thinks there's money in it somehow. Kaneru should have been the main character!

The show's humor is about on the level of Sunshine Sketch; it's mostly pretty unoriginal, borrowing liberally from other shows about doujinshi writers, but it's easy to watch and not offensively bad (mostly because of Tsuyuri). I have three episodes left to watch and I expect to watch them, gain some little enjoyment from them, and then forget this series exists. Though if the author wants to relaunch with Kaneru as the hero, I could give that a try.

On the last few episodes, Sunday,  August 19th, 2012: They switched from being merely forgettable to actually bad. I guess they wanted to do some kind of conclusion so they made Hoshi-kun's brother suddenly appear, be the editor of a major manga series, and need a guest artist to replace the major series since he screwed up and destroyed the manuscript for the major series. Hoshi-kun of course submits Najimi for consideration. Najimi suddenly starts selling books because her awfulness has become legendary on the Internet. Najimi is going to go pro, but chokes at the last minute because her contract won't allow her to make doujinshi anymore. The final joke of the series, which was actually decent, has Hoshi-kun's brother reading a pretty decent-looking shoujo manga with a hero who resembles Justice, which turns out to be drawn by Sora; Sora presumably goes pro due to being much better than Najimi. Kaneru goes out of character and becomes jealous of Najimi (Najimi is supposed to be the petty one, dammit!), whining that it's not fair. Though since her voice sounds pretty mature, her whines actually sound kind of cute, not annoying like they would if she had a higher voice. Anyway, this series really cannot do drama. It wasn't good at all. By the way, this is no longer an unfair first impression, but I didn't have enough to say to fill a new file so I just put it all in here.

[Sunday, January 6th, 2013: Real-life doujinshi author Gust, who draws rather terrible doujinshi in which all the girls have the same weird-looking, giant-breasted bodies and are constantly winking for no reason, reminds me of Najimi in the lack of depth, style, and quality of his art. The stories are all terrible too; they usually just begin with all the girls in some white space with no background, surrounded by faceless men that they are eager to be gang-banged by. He did a Negima doujin where he seemed to have picked the girls at random. He did a K-On doujin where he didn't even bother to draw panels; I guess it's really more of an illustration book with word balloons. He did a Bakemonogatari book where he unexpectedly showed good taste by choosing to draw Karen and Tsukihi, but I haven't looked at it because his art is generally so bad that I don't want to see my dear Fire Sisters depicted thusly.]

** Thursday, June 14th, 2012:

Gunslinger Girl: I actually read the first volume of the manga a long time ago (when it was published by ADV manga), and watched the anime series when it was on the Independent Film Channel, but I had mostly forgotten about it until a few weeks ago when I decided to buy an omnibus volume of the manga under re-release. I remember liking this series before, but it was truly amazing this time. The series is primarily what I'd call a deconstruction of the "small children with guns" concept; the girls are all abused or orphaned children who have been remade into cyborgs (oftentimes after their bodies were destroyed in some accident) and used by the Italian government as counterterror and intelligence agents, along with their handlers, who are all ex-military or police. 

The story explores every angle of the scenario; the dehumanization of the girls is well shown by the side effects of the drug that is used on them to facilitate the transition. The drug not only erases their memories (fully or partially), but also makes them experience intense feelings towards their handlers. Some of the girls are in love with their handlers; one, in an early story, realizes that her feelings will never be reciprocated and kills her handler before committing suicide. The girls are made to forget anything that might be inconvenient for the agency. They are also trained like SWAT team members to use various weapons and hand-to-hand combat techniques; the series showcases some truly awesome fight scenes, but also does a good job making the use of child soldiers disturbing and creepy. But even through all the creepiness, the girls are pretty cute, too. The handlers and staff have various reactions to this, all realistic and believable. 

During Volumes 2 and 3, some more formidable opponents for the cyborgs start to appear and everything seems to develop towards some kind of story arc or ongoing plot.  Gunslinger Girl can be a pretty heavy read, but it's among the better science fiction manga (as opposed to the more common space fantasy) that I've read. The art builds atmosphere well and depicts the Italian setting with great detail. 

** Sunday, June 3rd, 2012:

Another two fansubs to go over, both attempts to find something else to watch after losing interest in Acchi Kocchi and Mayo Chiki. I'm much more hopeful about these two.

Sakamichi no Apollon: I downloaded this just because I liked the opening song (sung by Yuki, who did the openings for Honey and Clover. It's always a good thing to remind me of Honey and Clover, the best shoujo anime I've ever watched). It turned out to be amazing so far. Kaoru Nishimi is a smart but scrawny high school student with a bad attitude; he gets physically ill with disgust because of his classmates' behaviour. His father, a sailor, is usually gone on a job, so Kaoru ends up going to live with his uncle and his uncle's bitchy wife in Kyushu. He loves to play the piano, and his uncle has a piano, but his uncle's wife won't let him play it, complaining about the noise.

On his first day of school Kaoru meets Sentaro Kawabuchi, a thuggish sort of guy who Kaoru's seatmate warns him about. They meet when Kaoru is trying to reach the roof, a place where he can calm down and relieve his illness. Some seniors have the key to the roof and won't give it to Kaoru, so Sentaro impulsively fights them and gets the key; when he won't give it to Kaoru, Kaoru snatches it. He and Sentaro end up standing on the roof together in the rain and get soaked when Sentaro tosses their umbrellas over the edge. At this point I thought this might be turning into one of those yaoi things (though the show was going so well, as far as atmosphere and writing, that I wasn't sure I cared if it did). But Kaoru is interested in girls after all; he falls for the class rep, Ritsuko Mukae, who is Sentaro's childhood friend. It turns out her family owns a record shop where Sentaro hangs out and plays jazz; in the spirit of competitiveness, Kaoru also starts learning to play jazz, although he'd only done classical up to that point. In Episode 2 he takes part in an off-the-cuff jam session with Sentaro on drums, Ritsuko's neighbour and older brother-figure on trumpet, and Ritsuko's father plucking a cello like a bass guitar. He also ends up going to the beach with Ritsuko and Sentaro, and is rescued by them when bullies from his class try to beat him up.

Even though I've only seen two episodes, they were so packed with content that it feels like a lot more. The character writing is excellent and reminded me again of Honey and Clover, and I really enjoyed the nice animation and old-fashioned atmosphere. There's also lots of great jazz music. Sakamichi no Apollon is an amazing show so far; it totally blew me away with its high quality. 

[Update from June 21st, 2012: I read somewhere that Sakamichi no Apollon's music was all done by Yoko Kanno. Yes, the legendary Yoko Kanno who worked on Cowboy Bebop, Vision of Escaflowne, and also Card Captor Sakura, if I'm not mistaken. No wonder the music was so good.]

Sankarea: Very different from Sakamichi no Apollon, but the first episode seemed promising. Furuya is the son of a Buddhist priest and a weirdo who wishes to have a romantic encounter with a zombie. (I can't remember his first name; it was late when I watched the show.) One day his cat is killed by a car and he digs out an old book on the art of resurrection and begins making a potion to resurrect the cat, working by night in an abandoned factory. One night a girl comes and starts screaming into the well outside that she hates her life and all about her problems. It turns out that she's Sanka Rea, a rich and beautiful girl lusted after by Furuya's requisite perverted friend. One day Furuya hears her scream that she wishes her father would stop taking naked pictures of her every birthday to track her growth and he's so startled that he drops his bottled tea and she notices him. Rea says she'll do anything so that he'll keep her secret and Furuya jokes that he'd like to test his resurrection potion on her. He also tells her about his zombie fetish. The end of the episode hints that Rea will end up dying and drink the zombie potion, becoming Furuya's dream zombie girlfriend.

This was another show with an excellent atmosphere, this time dark and oppressive. It reminded me a bit of some of the less weird moments from Bakemonogatari. The character writing was more pedestrian than Sakamichi no Apollon—Sankarea is really more of a standard anime, but in a good way. Rea is really cute, as is Furuya's sister Mero (the scene where they're standing over the cat's grave and she asks him if, as the daughter of a temple, she must maintain composure and Furuya says no, prompting Mero to kneel down next to him and cry, was too adorable). Furuya's crazy yet sexy cousin seemed a little too Denpa Onna-ish, but she might be all right. The first episode of Sankarea really pulled me in in a way that Mayo Chiki and Acchi Kocchi did not, so even if it's not as good as Sakamichi no Apollon, I hope it can be a provider of moe and fun.

** Friday, May 18th, 2012:

Two shows to briefly go over today, both fansubs that I tried out to see if I could escape from the minor malaise I've been feeling recently while trying to watch Pani Poni Negi, Code Geass, and Aria: The Natural at the same time.

Mayo Chiki: Jiro's mother and sister are pro-wrestlers who've used him as a punching bag ever since he was small, so he gets a nosebleed anytime a girl touches him. Like most boys in anime, he goes to a school with an insanely rich student, a girl named Kanade Suzutsuki. Kanade's butler, Subaru Konoe, is beloved by all the girls and considered handsome and wonderful. One day Jiro stumbles on Subaru in the bathroom and sees that "he" is wearing panties with character prints and has breasts. It turns out Subaru is a girl who disguises herself as a boy to carry on the grand butler tradition (?) of her family.

Mayo Chiki is a very Love Hina-style comedy. It's a lot like MM, but not quite as good so far. Also, the sexual aspects have a more perverted, creepy, prurient Ken Akamatsu feel to them, unlike the free-for-all libertine feeling of MM. The stories are hardly original and very hyper-realistic so far, but Subaru is very cute dressed as a girl and there have been a couple moments that made me laugh quite hard (most notably when Jiro explains that he gets a nosebleed from girls because his mother and sister would stop beating him up if his nose bled, not because they were concerned about him, but because they didn't want to ruin the carpet). The art and animation are nice and I'm hoping it'll bust out and really surprise me like MM did around Episode 4. I've watched three episodes of Mayo Chiki.

[Update May 27th, 2012: I've watched Episode 4 now and it still hasn't amazed me. It's starting to get sort of repetitive and uninteresting. It hasn't amazed me yet like MM and To-Love-Ru had by this point, and in Episode 5 they're going to start introducing more characters because they seem to be running out of ideas already, so I think I'm done with Mayo Chiki.]

[Update January 9th, 2013: Subaru is voiced by Eri Kitamura. She is boyish and does martial arts. Kanade is voiced by Yuka Iguchi. She is feminine and scheming. They stole Karen's and Tsukihi's voice actors. They probably just figured "Hey, they paired well with vaguely similar characters in that hit show, so let's take them!" MM did the same thing by stealing Ore Imo's pairing of Ayana Taketatsu and Saori Hayami, going from the small, cute, blonde, tsundere Kirino to the small, cute, blonde, tsundere Mio and from the (seemingly) friendly, (seemingly) laid back navy blue-haired Ayase to the friendly, laid back royal purple-haired Arashiko. Also, Mayo Chiki totally stole its weird butler thing from Hayate the Combat Butler.]

[Update July 19th, 2013: I was wrong; Subaru is voiced by Yuka Iguchi and Kanade is voiced by Eri Kitamura. It doesn't matter, they still stole it from Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan, they just reversed the roles. Also, Jiro's sister Kureha is voiced by Kana Hanazawa, though I attribute this more to the fact that almost every show nowadays has a character voiced by Kana Hanazawa, because they clearly didn't steal Kureha from Nadeko. But they still totally stole their weird butler thing from Hayate the Combat Butler, which, now that I have watched it, I can say is a much better show in all sorts of ways. For one thing, Hinagiku was a much better tomboy than Subaru, even if she was voiced by neither Yuka Iguchi nor Eri Kitamura. For another, Nagi is a much better rich girl than Kanade, even if she was voiced by neither Eri Kitamura nor Yuka Iguchi. Also, it has Isumi. That right there is pretty much the death blow.]

[More thefts, September 28th, 2013: Also, I recently watched Fate/Stay Night and then happened to see Subaru on a web page somewhere and thought "Saber?" Subaru's design is absolutely 100% stolen from Saber.]

Acchi Kocchi: Yet another moe yon-koma, but amazingly, it actually has male characters. The main heroine, Tsumiki, is a dead ringer for Lucky Star's Konata, but she's much more adorable, often taking on cat features and enjoying being petted and cuddled by Io, the main male character who resembles chibi Lelouch in glasses. Crazy fix-it girl Mayoi, ditzy, and clumsy Hime, who gets a nosebleed when she sees a cute moment between Io and Tsumiki, and perverted Sakaki, along with their generic crazy teacher, fill out the cast. The stories are sort of generic so far and the characters are mostly nothing special, but Io and Tsumiki are an intensely adorable pair, and this was the first time in a while I found myself thinking about how adorable a character (Tsumiki here) was the day after watching the show. I've watched the first episode of Acchi Kocchi and am willing to watch a few more.

[Update May 27th 2012: I've watched Episode 2, which continued the snooze-fest. Tsumiki is still as adorable as ever and they had some good jokes about Io's handsomeness and lady-killer attributes, but they had to introduce a cake shop. Yes, there's always a cake shop. Actually, I didn't mind the cake shop that much; it sort of reminded me of Chobits, which is always a good thing. But Sakaki and Mayoi, the designated crazy characters, are really sort of generic and uninteresting. If we could ditch them and get some decent side characters who know their places, the show might stand a better chance. Unlike with Mayo Chiki, I actually wanted this one to succeed really badly because the main pair are so cute, but it hasn't delivered yet.]

** Friday, March 30th, 2012:

Gosick: I actually watched about ten episodes of this, but it was quite a while ago (during the spring of 2011), so I'm putting it here. Perhaps it should've gone in the distant memories file? Anyway, Gosick takes place in the 1920s in a small European country called Sauville which borders France. The main character, Kujo, is a transfer student from the Japanese Empire who meets a tiny blonde girl in black lace and frills named Victorica. (The translations all say Victorique, but the Japanese says Victorica and I like the sound better.) Victorica is in Kujo's school, but she never attends class and sits in the library at the top of a massive staircase reading books all day. It turns out that she loves mysteries and is sort of a Sherlock Holmes-style super-detective; a police officer named Grevil de Blois with insane drill hair is always coming to ask her advice, though he hates her and pretends she's not there, using Kujo as a pretense to speak with her. 

I love the feel of Gosick, with its 1920s European theme and use of the Arthur Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie mystery tradition. Unfortunately most of the mysteries are a bit too conventional, but the characters are quite likeable, with Kujo a (surprisingly tough and determined) everyman and Victorica a temperamental and quirky detective like Holmes or Hercule Poirot. (In moe terms, she's a tsundere, much like Holmes would have been if he were a cute girl in a Japanese anime.) I got a little tired of the stories, but I've heard it really picks up right after where I quit, so I may go back to Gosick. By the way, The Mystic Archives of Dantalian totally ripped off this show.

** Sunday, January 8th, 2012:

Code Geass: To anyone reading my other essays and reviews, this probably seems like the most random choice on the planet. It's a Sunrise show about giant robots and rebellions, with no moe and bishounen character designs courtesy of CLAMP. I actually used to be sort of a Sunrise fan, though I was never a huge Gundam lover. But the hype caught me, and I finally had to see why everyone loved this show so much.

If I end up watching a lot, I'll probably write more complete thoughts on Code Geass, but I wanted to just give a quick impression of the first episode, which I watched last night. I wasn't expecting much; I thought I'd get a talky, boring, confusing mess wrapped around scenes of giant robots slamming into each other for some reason, like most of the newer Gundam shows I've tried watching. It was sort of like that, but it was also sort of cool, and when the first episode ended I wanted to see more, which isn't true of a lot of shows. I find the Victorian Era and the British Imperial Age interesting, so I like this sort of alternate history where the British Empire rules everything, and the idea of North America as part of the British Empire and the Japanese as downtrodden colonial subjects is a compelling setup for a rebellion story. I also like hyper-genius characters like Death Note's L and Light Yagami, so I expect to enjoy watching the show's main character, Lelouch Lamperouge, who spends his first scene finishing a supposedly impossible chess game where only twenty seconds are allowed per move in about eight minutes. Lelouch gets unwillingly sucked into the rebellion when he ends up mistakenly hitching a ride to the rebel hideout on a truck with a mysterious pod stolen from the Britannian (aka British Empire) military in the back. The Britannian troops are going to kill him, but the pod opens and (of course) contains a girl with mysterious powers, who gets shot and gives Lelouch his own mysterious powers before perishing. His powers seem to give him the ability to make anyone follow his order, so he orders the troops to shoot themselves and the episode ends.

The usual Sunrise caveats might catch up to me and make me stop watching Code Geass, but for now it's a pleasant surprise how good the first episode was.

Queen's Blade: The Exiled Virgin: Basically Red Sonja: The Anime, Queen's Blade follows the exploits of Leina, the daughter of Count Vance. The Count for some reason wants her to inherit his position even though he has an older daughter, Claudette, and a younger daughter, Elina, who has an obsessive lesbian crush on Leina. Leina rebels and runs off, meeting Risty, a bandit, and together they go to compete in the Queen's Blade tournament, which is a fighting tournament whose winner becomes next queen of the land.

For some reason, every woman in this show has the exact same body; they're all tall, with thunder thighs and huge breasts, like in those Dead or Alive doujinshi that were all over the Internet in the early 2000s. They all wear armor which doesn't cover the stomach and has a push-up brassiere built in that sculpts their cleavages to perfection. None of them wears any armor on her lower body other than a thong with a metal plate on it. Then they jump around and fight like that, and the result looks utterly ridiculous. I'm not a big fan of the art style or character designs to begin with (since I'm a loli-con, sis-con moe lover), and then you add the awful story and trite characterization and you have a pile of garbage. I heard this show was somewhat popular as a guilty pleasure; I can see what made it guilty, but I fail to see what made it a pleasure. I watched two episodes of Queen's Blade, and I'm about to send it back to Netflix without watching the other two on the disc.

[By the way, the way the translation picks its l's and r's seems to be all backwards. I kept thinking it should be Reina and Listy, not Leina and Risty.]

Bakemonogatari: I keep on hearing how good it is, and I've been listening to the music for a while now, but no one's streaming it and illegal downloads are for some reason rare (maybe now that it's been out a while they've shut down all the illegal download outlets). Anyway, it's based on a series of light novels by Nisioisin, whose Zaregoto books I read around the same time I was getting really into light novels and reading The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, Gosick, and Spice and Wolf. I ended up buying the first Zaregoto book based on the cleverly written prologue I read on Amazon, and loved both it and the sequel. Nisioisin's writing style is similar to Nagaru Tanigawa's, with a clever, self-deprecating narrator who claims to be a normal Japanese youth despite hints to the contrary, and a cast of bizarre side characters. Zaregoto, however, was more dense and philosophical than Haruhi, with a lot less lightheartedness, some darker themes, and a brain-twisting mystery plot. The characters have more psychological baggage as well.

I can't generalize this much to Bakemonogatari, but the dialogue was very similar to the Zaregoto books, and first heroine Hitagi Senjougahara's first major scene involves her shoving a box cutter and a stapler in the main character's mouth and threatening to cut him if he doesn't swear to keep the secret that she has no weight, so she's pretty dark. Even when he does swear, she still puts a staple into his cheek. The main character, Koyomi Araragi, was once turned into a vampire and turned back into a human by a mysterious man named Meme Oshino, so he brings Hitagi to see if Oshino can help her. (He proves his story to Hitagi by showing how the wound from her staple in his cheek has already healed.) The scene where Oshino talks to Hitagi about what happened to her also felt very dense and psychological, like Zaregoto. 

The animation in the show was quite good; it was very stylized and used strange lighting and colors to create an atmosphere, similar to The Soul Taker. The oddness of the art style helped make things like Hitagi's array of art supplies that she uses as weaponry, which would've been cartoonish and ruined the mood in a more down-to-earth style, seem not so out of place. I'd like to watch more, but the download I finally found was for the Blu-Ray version, so it's huge and doesn't play perfectly on my software, so I don't know if I'll be able to unless someone takes pity on us and releases it on DVD.

[Update Wednesday, September 19th, 2012: Crunchyroll has decided to start streaming Bakemonogatari, presumably because they also have the sequel, Nisemonogatari.]

** Monday, November 7th, 2011

I seem to get the impulse to write these on Mondays for some reason, don't I? Here's a few more shows I've watched only the first few episodes of recently and had some immediate impressions of.

Chu-Bra: I was looking for something sexy, clever, and fun, like MM, but I was willing to settle for sexy and fun. Chu-Bra, unfortunately, gave me only sexy, and it couldn't even be unambiguous about it. It follows Nayu Hayama, who trips while going to the podium to deliver a speech on her first day of middle school and reveals that she's wearing sexy black lace panties. One of the students who saw, Haruka I-Forget-Her-Last-Name [Shiraishi], and her friend Yako Jinguji, become intrigued and start investigating Nayu after hearing rumors that she does enjou kousai. They become even more convinced that the rumors are true after she randomly gropes Haruka's extremely large breasts, but discover the truth when Nayu reveals her expert knowledge of underwear gained from her work as an underwear monitor, who tests underwear for its quality. She has some kind of weird obsession with underwear that reminds me of the way Akari Mizunashi feels about being a gondolier in Aria, except it's applied to underwear so it's weird. At the end of the second episode, Nayu can't decide which club to join and suddenly hits on the idea of forming a club devoted to underwear, which seems to be where the rest of the show goes.

The show gives us lots of great cheesecake shots of the girls in their underwear and in the first episode  at one point it makes like it's going to parody all those "ganbare girls!" shows about the beauty of girls in their flowering adolescence, like Sailor Moon often was, but then it seems to waver and actually become one of those shows, except involving underwear, so it's weird. If it had played a little with the essential weirdness of the fact that it's examining adolescence through the metaphor of underwear, it could've been pretty clever and funny, but it doesn't; it seems to give up and just actually pursue that absurd plot. Also, I must be getting old, because I found it a little weird that the girls are all in their first year of middle school, making them about twelve or thirteen. I was never bothered by this back in the 90s when it was common, though I was only about thirteen myself. Not that they look young; they're sort of the reverse of those Lolita girls who look twelve when they're seventeen, and look like busty twenty-year-olds when they're only twelve. (Yako looks like a real Lolita girl, but Nayu and especially the abundant Haruka look much too old.) Nayu is incredibly cute but lacks definition as a main character. There's another character, Kiyono, who hasn't shown up yet, but the ending sequence indicates she's pretty much just a rich, tsundere character; there's also a boy who seems to end up joining the club, which could end up being amusing if I watch any more of the show. At this point I've seen two episodes of Chu-Bra.

On the manga of Chu-Bra, 2013-7-4: The manga makes it really clear that the series is a "ganbare onnanoko!" series about the tribulations of girls going through puberty, but using underwear. Also, almost every single page contains a cheesecake shot of one of the girls in underwear (at the beginning it was pretty even, but as the series moves on, almost all of the shots depict either Haruka or Kiyono Amahara), so I can't read it around people because if they happen to see one of the pages it will just look like I'm reading porn. Manga Nayu is sort of like one of those shounen heroes that goes out of his way to befriend all of his enemies (Yugi Muto, Yoh Asakura), except instead of fighting over whether to be friends with your deck of cards or treat them like a tool, she is arguing with people over whether underwear is terrible and erotic or not, and instead of a big final battle, there's a big final underwear shot. She also has a streak of the easily depressed quitter who needs support from one's friends to go on that was common in '90s anime. Kiyono Amahara initially clashes with Nayu because she has a different philosophy of underwear (that it's for seduction), but becomes the "sixth ranger", loose cannon member of the underwear club who nonetheless values her friendship with the other girls and comes to respect Nayu's philosophy of underwear, while the boy, Komachi, is sort of the "operator" character and helps facilitate and organize, as well as serving as Nayu's love interest. The big breasted teacher, Mizuno-sensei, and a cross-dresser from the Manga Club, Amane, also become somewhat important characters.

Luckily, the series doesn't take itself too seriously; it doesn't exactly mock itself, but it never gets too deep or heavy and always keeps things moving along, using the themes as believable character conflicts and showing the girls coming to terms with things, quite a bit like Hanasaku Iroha (but with underwear so it's weird). I liked Haruka's nascent lesbian love for Nayu, which was cute, erotic, and felt natural all at once. The friendship that develops between Amahara and Amane was also pretty cute. Although it isn't quite like MM, the manga version of Chu-Bra does fulfill my original reason for watching the anime series: it's light, reasonably fun, and sexy.


Akane-Iro ni Somaru Saka: I downloaded this even though I heard it wasn't good because I was really in the mood for an old-fashioned renai game-based show. So far I can't say much about it; the animation isn't great, many of the characters are boring stereotypes, and a lot of the interactions with the minor characters have that same contrived, disingenuous air that made me give up Fortune Arterial and Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi. But the two main girls, Yuuhi and Minato, are very cute and could turn out to be interesting.

As for the plot, it's not very original. Yuuhi is the tsundere daughter of a rich family who is saved one day by the main character, who somehow gained a reputation as a great fighter, and at first likes him when she transfers into his school. Then something stupid happens and he ends up kissing her, which angers her because it was her first kiss. It turns out their fathers want them to marry, so Yuuhi moves in with the main character and his sister (Minato) and tries to come to terms with her fate. At this point I've watched two episodes of Akane Iro ni Somaru Saka.

Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu: Sort of a low-rent version of Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai. Follows Yuuto Ayase, a self-proclaimed normal high school student who lives with his teacher and some relative (probably older sister, based on the age), both of whom are constantly drunk and rabble-rousing. One day he discovers that the girl everyone thought was perfect, rich, piano-playing, beautiful Haruka Nogizaka, is secretly an otaku, and decides to help her keep it secret. I liked Yuuto's friend Nobunaga, also an otaku, and the fact that his looks make girls take notice of him until he drives them off with his otaku ranting. Haruka herself was also adorable (voiced by Mamiko Noto, Nodoka Miyazaki's seiyuu), and Yuuto wasn't bad either—he's no Kyon, but he's better than Makoto from Denpa Onna. The show also had pretty art, with unnecessarily European-style architecture and a nice classical-style soundtrack that reminded me of Utena. The two major sore spots were the animation, which wasn't impressive (when I saw the ending sequence, I knew where they spent all their money), and the cartoony background characters, like Yuuto's four perverted friends (or were there only three?), the drunk, rowdy women he lives with, and Haruka's fanclub, who magically appear at the slightest hint of affront to Haruka and beat up the guilty party. The sequence in the library where Yuuto and Haruka fall all over each other was also more Love Hina than Ore Imo. I doubt these things will get any better as the show progresses, but I suppose it's possible they could move towards a more realistic Ore Imo-like feel.

** Friday, September 16th, 2011

Happiness!: Yet another show about a school of magic. In this case, there's also a normal school and apparently the students have some interaction. Like most such shows (Mahoutsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto/Someday's Dreamers), the show doesn't put any thought into how the existence of magic would change the modern world. (It's actually even less than Someday's Dreamers.) It did have one good joke: halfway through we discover that the girl who's been hanging on the main character's arm the whole time is actually a guy.

Kanamemo: An adorable girl loses her home when her grandmother dies and has to move into a newspaper office full of weird lesbians, becoming their personal chef. Definitely had a yon-koma sort of feel. It wasn't overly original, but it was a bit more audacious with the yuri than K-On, which might prove fun at some point. And like I said, the main heroine is really cute.

The Mystic Archives of Dantalian: In England sometime during the early 20th Century, a young man named Hugh inherits his grandfather's mansion and book collection, along with a note asking him to take care of Dalian, which he thinks is a dog. He discovers that Dalian is a young girl with purple hair and corpse-white skin who likes reading, and that his grandfather's book collection included the Mystic Archives of Dantalian, a collection of evil demon-possessed books. A monster emerges from a book and goes on a rampage, and Hugh must use Dalian's magic to gain superpowers and fight it. The concept was intriguing, though it looked a little too monster-of-the-week, and Dalian was really cute and sort of a tsundere going light on the tsun, like a lighter version of Gosick's Victorica (I liked her voice, too). I'd watch more if there was nothing else on.

A Dark Rabbit Wears Seven Ears (or some crap like that): Sort of like a gender-swapped Twilight, with a female vampire who creepily pursues a male human who gave her some of his life force back when they were kids and as a result cannot die. Also includes an evil student council president who is lusted after by all the girls, but is an asshole to everyone. I didn't really see where it was going and wasn't inclined to follow it.

Yuru Yuri: The result of someone flagrantly trying to combine Lucky Star and K-On. It has Lucky Star's art style and K-On's general concept, with a group of four girls taking over the tea ceremony club and using it as an excuse to screw around, with much more obvious yuri, like Kanamemo. Actually the fourth girl plays the Azu-nyan part; she's a small, cute girl who genuinely wanted to join the tea ceremony club but ends up with the three idiots. The other three characters fill the Mio part, Ritsu part, and Yui part. Why no Mugi?! How unfair. I happen to know now that she has other fans, at least in Japan. Actually the Ritsu expy is an aggressive lesbian like Maria-Holic's Kanako, so maybe she was supposed to be a combination of the Ritsu and Mugi parts, though that's still totally unfair to Mugi because she was nothing like Kanako. It's decent if unoriginal; some of the jokes were sort of clever.

[September 13th, 2013: I later watched the second episode of Yuru Yuri and was able to remember the characters' names. We have Akari → Yui, Kyoko → Ritsu, Yui → Mio, and Chinatsu → Azu-nyan. Unlike K-On, though, it has more characters than just the main four. There's also a mean student council president who has it in for Kyoko yet secretly wants to be friends, and her assistant, a yuri freak (voiced by Aki Toyosaki) who fantasizes that her clumsy attempts to be friends with Kyoko mean she's actually in lesbian love with Kyoko. There's also a pair of bitter rivals who are also best friends and possible lesbian lovers. As the title suggests, yuri is this show's main reason for existing. The second episode wasn't bad, but I was watching it just because there wasn't a new episode of Bakemonogatari out, and then Bakemonogatari continued and I didn't stick with it. (It was when Tsubasa Cat wasn't coming out because it's an ONA that was never on Crunchyroll. I ended up skipping ahead to Nisemonogatari.)]

[April 15th, 2014] I read the manga of Yuru Yuri. It doesn't have the K-On influence of the anime; it's pretty squarely Lucky Star with Yuri. We have Kyoko -> Konata, Yui -> Kagami / Minami, Akari -> Tsukasa (ditzy, good at housework, little exposure), Chinatsu -> Yutaka. The characters didn't feel so much like ripoffs, though, but there's very little character development beyond yuri. So it was pretty cute and titillating, but not great. There's actually a pretty heavy love polyhedron latent in the club. Chinatsu is in love with Yui (she obsesses over her and wants to kiss her). Kyoko is in love with Chinatsu (or at any rate wants to kiss her, because she looks like Kyoko's favorite anime magical girl). Yui says she loves Kyoko, although the context makes it looks like she means as friends. The other two think Chinatsu is in love with Akari because they walked in on her pushing Akari down for apparent lesbian rape (she was actually trying to force Akari to practice kissing with her for when she kisses Yui). Also, the student council president, Ayano, is in love with Kyoko (it's not just Chitose's fantasies as in the anime, there's actual evidence). Sakurako and Himawari, the two battling council undermembers, are hinted to be in love with each other too. 

The story is super thin, I mean so thin it makes K-On look like Game of Thrones. If the story could be developed more, I think the manga could be a pretty good series. But the author has already done a couple fourth wall-breaking stories, including one where he commits to "Sazae-san time" (so seasons pass but time never does). So I don't think that will happen.

Nichijou: Another yon-koma type show about high school girls. I actually downloaded it because I'd been listening to the ending and it was too cute. It didn't grab me, though; the characters felt very stereotypical and the show did weird diversions into a separate plot involving a little girl mad scientist and the robot she'd built. It did have a good running joke where one character greeted everyone with "Selamat Pagi" ("Good morning" in Indonesian), trying to get them to accept it as a new greeting. Also, that ending was too cute.

Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi: A bald ripoff of Kanon, except without any apparent understanding of what made Kanon good. The hero has a shotaro little brother as a gimmick to differentiate the show from the hordes of other clones. Also, the woman he stays with runs an onsen and likes getting naked and tackling him for some reason. Rejected.

Sket Dance: Follows the Sket-Dan, a club of students who try to solve problems on campus. They're very hip-hop in style. The first episode had a pretty good plot line and nice animation; the characters seemed a little basic and one-dimensional, but that could improve later on. It felt very '90s, but in a good way.

A-Channel: Yet another yon-koma-type story about high school girls. A little boring and with very stereotypical characters, but the animation is amazing and I really liked the opening sequence.

Amagami SS: Sort of a Tokimeki Memorial-type story about schoolyard love, based on a bishoujo game. I watched three episodes. Like Yosuga no Sora, the show reboots reality to show different girls' stories; it begins with the popular upperclassman Haruka Morishima and shows her frisky relationship with the hero. A nice show with cute girls, but a little slow for me, and it's very seriously a romance, a genre that's a little on the outs with me nowadays. Still, another one I'd go back to if there was nothing else around.

Sora no Woto: Sort of a unique show that follows a girl named Kanata Sora who lives in a Full Metal Alchemist-like world that looks like Europe in the late Imperial Age (around World War I) as she moves towards her dream of becoming a military trumpeter. Despite the weird spelling, the title is pronounced "Sora no Oto" and means "Sound of the Sky" [but puns on "Sound of Sora", the main character]. I actually meant to buy this one, which is why I never watched another episode; the animation was very nice, reminding me of Laputa, and Sora lives on a base full of cute girls, promising yuri undertones.

Soredemo Machi wa Mawatteiru: A weird comedy show about a girl who works at a maid cafe, her maid cafe-obsessed friend, and the boy who forms the link in a love chain between them. The lowbrow style of the comedy was vaguely reminiscent of Excel Saga, though not as random and without the constant parodies. The main character, Hotori, had a rather annoying, nasal voice.

Ookamikakushi: Related in some way to Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (I think based on a game by the same creator) and very similar in feeling. It didn't arrest me in quite the same way because the threat is presented as blatantly supernatural from the beginning, taking away a lot of the psychological tension of Higurashi. 

Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?: Felt like a parody of Fate/Stay Night and Tsukihime. It centers around a boy who was murdered by a serial killer and brought back as the zombie slave of a necromancer named Eucliwood Hellscythe, aka Yuu (he's a voodoo-style zombie, so he can talk, walk at full speed, and isn't a rotting corpse, but he also can't die). During his quest to find his killer, he encounters another girl who's some sort of magical girl (a "masou shoujo") who fights monsters with a chainsaw and everything gets sort of ridiculous; he spends a lot of time getting mutilated in massive sprays of blood and at the end dresses up in the masou shoujo's tutu to fight a giant lobster. Goes for the gross-out with tons of nudity, blood, and flying body parts.

H2O: Footprints in the Sand: Like Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi, a ripoff of Kanon. Its gimmick is that the main hero is about three feet tall and blind. It wasn't very sensitive to blind people; he was constantly stumbling into girls and feeling their breasts because of his blindness, which I think blind people learn to avoid after about a year of being blind. At one point I seem to remember him getting his supercharged blind kid nose in a girl's panties because of the usual terrible scene where everyone for some contrived reason falls over in a big pile. Of course the girl is a tsundere and hates him at first, until he discovers a terrible secret about her. The animation wasn't too impressive either, but on the whole it was a little better than Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi.

Fortune Arterial: I saw five episodes of this vampire-themed bishoujo game-based show that seemed like a softer, gentler Tsukihime. It was okay for a while, and some of the characters weren't bad, like genki girl Kanade, whose love for her sister Haruka goes beyond sisterly. (Yes, I'm into sister yuri.) The silliness of the execution and great amount of filler, plus a lack of investment in the two main girls, vampire Erika and mysterious other girl whose name I don't remember but I liked that she was good at math since no one in anime is ever good at math, dragged it down. [I think her name was Mana something.] I'd probably sit through the rest of the series without a gun to my head, though.

Sora no Otoshimono: At first glance just a very generic ecchi show, it carried a few hints of darker things and had a nice art style and animation. I was going to watch more than the first episode, but Funimation started streaming it and I felt bad downloading it. I also didn't feel like watching it streaming since all I saw was a very generic ecchi show. Thus, I didn't watch it.

[I hate the translation of the title in the official release as "Heaven's Lost Property"; I thought "What Fell from the Sky" or "What Heaven Lost" would have been good translations. "Heaven's Lost Property" is much too literal and sounds like someone with no experience translating straight out of a dictionary.]
