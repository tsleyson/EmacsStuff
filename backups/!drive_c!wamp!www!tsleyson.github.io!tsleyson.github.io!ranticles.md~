## College
Buying the snake oil is pretty stupid. You stand there and listen to the dim-witted pitch: "This here snake oil will cure cancer! Raise the dead! Keep away Ebola! Ward off Alzheimer's! Put a spring in your step and in your schlong!" Every claim makes you more and more sure this here snake oil is the cure for what ails you.

The salesman finishes his pitch. "Yes-sirree, if you buy this, you got a bright future ahead of you—good, high-payin job, interestin work, nice comfy retirement. After all, the market knows the value of a snake oil-user. They know they're gettin the best with you. But all that's pretty much gone if you don't buy this here snake oil—you're gonna be cleanin gum off the sidewalk the rest of your life." You hate cleaning gum off the sidewalk. No matter what, you have to have the snake oil.

You ask the salesman how much, and he won't tell you. Instead he asks you how much you got. You tell him, and he says "Well, boy shucks howdy, that ain't never gonna be enough to afford this here snake oil. But if you're serious, I could let you buy it on credit."

You have to have the snake oil, so you agree. You ask the salesman what the terms for the credit are. "I can't tell ya now," he says. "But you'll know it when ya need it."

You take the snake oil every day, but nothing seems to change. You still get sick. You still end up cleaning gum off the sidewalk. You hear of other people taking the snake oil who have amazing things happen to them. They get nice, high-paying jobs, interesting work, and a nice comfy retirement. But not you. You can't figure out what's different.

Long after the snake oil is gone, the salesman comes around for his repayment. He presents a bill for several hundred times your yearly wages at your gum-scraping job, payable now. You can't pay it, so he takes everything you have, gets your employer to pay everything you make directly to him, and charges you more money for every day you don't pay him back the full amount. Then he makes you thank him for it.

"I taught you valuable life lessons," he says. "I taught you to be an adult and own up to your mistakes."

Buying that snake oil was pretty stupid. Buying it on credit was even stupider.
## Success
Some people I know say "I look at those rich people who've never had to suffer, and I see their success, and I don't wish I had it. Even if I'm not successful, I'm glad I suffered. It made me a better person. It made me who I am today." But it seems to me that society doesn't care. Society values people who achieve the same thing as everyone else in the same way as everyone else.

Sometimes someone achieves the same thing as everyone else in a slightly different way. Then they get lauded as a maverick genius who went against the common wisdom. But the important thing is that the end result is the same. People who do things a different way and achieve a different outcome aren't lauded or praised. They're usually ignored or reviled or mocked.

Society doesn't reward for failure. No matter how instructive it was. No matter how much better a person you are because of your suffering, if you didn't hit the markers, you failed. Maybe in some abstract sense you've been rewarded, but if your aim was to get some tangible reward, you won't. It doesn't matter how big your obstacles were or what kind of suffering you went through. If you suffered and achieved what everyone else does, sometimes society will notice. Sometimes it will pat you on the back. But only if you hit the right checkpoints. Otherwise you're just a failure.

I am a failure. I wanted to achieve something tangible, but because of my suffering, I didn't. Society doesn't care. Maybe some day I'll be able to look on that suffering as its own reward. Not today.
