* 1. What are the five characteristics of a good scientific theory that Kuhn thinks are “the shared basis for theory choice”?
Accuracy, consistency, broad scope, simplicity, and fruitfulness.

* 2. Give one reason why “the shared basis for theory choice” (p.357) does not always determine which theory should be chosen.

Scientists don't always agree on how to apply the shared basis. Kuhn mentions that the oxygen and phlogiston theories of combustion were both accurate in certain ways, and scientists differed on which was more important (358).

* 3. What does Kuhn mean by “textbook science”?

Science as presented in textbooks, or in general, in a context of science pedagogy, long after the theories are accepted by the community. Kuhn finds that philosophers too often argue about theory choice using textbook science, which makes it seem very cut and dried.

* 4. What is the sense of ‘subjective’ in which Kuhn denies that theory choice is subjective?

The sense in which 'subjective' is the opposite to 'judgmental'. As Kuhn explains, 'subjective' in this sense means 'determined by personal taste, rather than reasoned judgment'. Kuhn believes theory choice is very much a matter of judgment, but that it has elements which are not objective, hence subjective in that sense.

* 5. The meaning of the expression “partial communication” (p.364) is close to the meaning of another expression in Kuhn’s philosophy of science. What is that expression? (It’s on the “key concepts” list for Ch.4.)
Partial communication is similar to the idea of linguistic or observation incommensurability—the idea that scientists thinking within different paradigms will use certain words with different meanings, and thus have trouble communicating unless they can find a way to translate between the two vocabularies.
