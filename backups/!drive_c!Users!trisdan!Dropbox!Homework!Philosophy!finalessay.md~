The purpose of the final paper is to make sure that you read Ch.6 of the textbook carefully and understand the main ideas in it. Please write an essay of about 1,000 words that satisfies the following two conditions:

(1) Summary all the main ideas of the chapter.

(2) Pick one of the main ideas for critical examination.

Please note that you are supposed to write an essay rather than construct a list of points. You don't have to summarize everything in the chapter but only the main ideas, and you can organize your summary in whatever way you like. Part (1) should be 60%-70% of your essay, while part (2) should be about 30-40%.
