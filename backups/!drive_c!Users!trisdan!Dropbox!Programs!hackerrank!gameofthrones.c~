/*
 * Generating all permutations won't work. Too many.
 * But, to form a palindrome, we need all the characters to occur in
 * pairs (except we can have one unmatched character, but only if the
 * number of characters is odd). So I think I can write a function
 * that counts the characters and stores the results in a simple hash
 * table (since all the strings are lowercase letters, just inchar -
 * 'a' ought to be a good enough hashing function).
