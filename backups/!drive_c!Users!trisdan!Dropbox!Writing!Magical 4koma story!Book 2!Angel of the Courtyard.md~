Angel of the Courtyard. By Nora.
================================
I finished *Horror High: Totes Terrified!* the day after Ranta and I went to the book fair and met her brother, Rel. I had made a fool of myself and ended up with *A History of the Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire, Volume 4*. I was going to try reading it someday, but for now I wanted something a little different.

Books can be kind of like food. Some books are strange and hard, but you read them just to say you've done it, like going to a fancy restaurant and eating weird designer food. Some are light and easy and sweet, but don't leave you with much after you're done, like cotton candy. *Horror High* was that kind of book. And some books are rich and filling and warm you up inside, like chicken soup on a rainy day. That was the kind of book I wanted to read right now, so after class ended, I went over to the library to look for one.

Miss Hanover had told me that if I couldn't find anything in our library, she could take me to the high school's library and show me around. The high school library was huge, she said; it had so many books that no one could possibly read them all, even if all they did was read and read for their entire life. Any other day, I would have said yes right away, but today I was a little scared of running into Rel again. Even with Miss Hanover to protect me, I didn't want to see him again so soon.

So I crossed the courtyard to the elementary school library that day. I checked the poetry section, and found a book of poems by Emily Dickinson. My dad had told me about her, and I had read a few of her poems, but the library had a big book with lots of poems I'd never read, so I checked it out and went back over to the clubroom.

When I got there, a note from Lily was pinned to the door. She had something to do today over at the middle school and wasn't going to be back until late evening, so she'd left the clubroom locked.
