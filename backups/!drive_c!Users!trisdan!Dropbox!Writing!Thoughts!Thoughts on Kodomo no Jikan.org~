* Kodomo no Jikan: (One of) the most reviled series ever!! isn't really that bad. <2014-07-19 Sat>
Let me start by acknowledging that Kodomo no Jikan is one of the most reviled series ever. This is because its main subject matter is disturbing loli sexuality, and while it began as a lighthearted loli series about having sex with little girls (?), as it develops, it does not actually shy away from the disturbing parts of disturbing loli sexuality. This makes it simultaneously a much more disturbing and more complex work than its critics usually seem to give it credit for; some parts of it even come close to something like a critique on the pedophiliac tendencies in anime and manga (and Japanese society in general). Then at the end, it sort of falls on its face. More about that later.

The premise is that Aoki Daisuke is a newly minted elementary school teacher who is assigned a third grade class at his first job out of school. One of the students in that class is Kokonoe Rin, a problem child who acted out so badly that Aoki's predecessor quit. Aoki discovers that Rin was getting back the teacher for her friend, Usa Mimi, who was tormented in ways I don't remember by the teacher and stopped coming to school. Aoki convinces Usa to come back to school, earning the respect and love of Rin and Usa and the ire of their other friend, Kagami Kuro, who has a lesbian crush on Rin. 

Rin proceeds to start coming on to Aoki in all kinds of over-the-top ways, like showing him her panties and asking for him to have sex with her as a reward for good grades. Aoki resists, although the way he reacts is pretty much like the way To-Love-Ru's Rito or any other harem hero would react, except Rin is in third grade. I presume the anime only covered the first part of the manga, so pretty much everyone said "Child porn" and proceeded to hate it. It does not help the series' case that the sexual content gets more and more extreme as it goes on and that Aoki does actually end up falling in love with Rin.

It turns out that Rin has a pretty screwed-up past; her mother, Aki, was unwed and thus shunned from the family, but refused to marry Rin's father because he asked her to abort Rin. Aki died when Rin was young, right before her eyes; at the time the series starts, Rin is cared for by her cousin Reiji, who moved in with Aki when his abusive parents were killed in a car wreck and ended up shacking up with Aki and falling in love with her. Reiji is totally fixated on Aki, and his mental state is none too stable; not long after he's introduced, he starts treating Rin like a substitute for Aki, giving her hickeys in bed and thinking disturbingly about how she's going to replace Aki when she gets old enough. Aoki finds out and ends up setting him straight by dressing him down about being a child-man; although still crazy, Reiji does get better over the series by trying to deal with his issues, and also by helping Rin's friend Usa, who doesn't get along with her own mother and who has a crush on Reiji. 

Other characters' pathologies are also explored, including Shirai-sensei, a senior teacher at the school, whose parents pushed her to achieve while also lowering her self-esteem. Shirai bonds with Kuro, who befriends her by force when she takes over the class while Aoki is away. The main theme of the series is how the adults in a child's life, especially parents and teachers, influence the people they end up becoming. The series surprisingly does a pretty good job exploring this theme. In Shirai-sensei's and Kuro's and Reiji's stories, it focuses on non-sexual aspects; in Rin's and Mimi's and some of the shorter arcs, it focuses a lot on the sexual parts of growing up. Weirdly, the series comes out on the side of encouraging sex ed by having Houin-sensei, a busty teacher with a secret crush on Aoki, anonymously combat misinformation on a secret forum the students are using. When it got down to it, Kojika was actually not bad at doing realistic stories about sex ed (the forum story and Mimi beginning her period), sexual harassment (the final story arc where the school principal is a pedo), and sexual exploration (Rin's discovery of porn and masturbation). Mostly, those stories didn't feel pornographic or exploitative at all, though they did deal very frankly with sexual material.

But the two faces of the story—the serious, realistic side and the lighthearted loli side—conflicted somewhat. The subject matter, even considering only the realistic stories,  is so controversial that only a greatly skilled writer could deal with it and not end up offending someone. Actually, it may not even be possible for anyone to deal with this material and not offend someone. Kaworu Watashiya, the manga-ka, weakened his(?) position almost irreparably with the things that *did* feel cheesecakey—the early stories, and the composition of certain scenes in the later stories. And yet, moments like Reiji's revelations about himself when he tries to ghost-write Rin's PTSD survey after she sacrifices herself to expose the pedo principal, or Shirai's honest attempts to change herself, were so well-written that it's hard for me to believe that Watashiya only wanted to make little girl cheesecake and just incidentally threw in a story. It's the opposite feeling I got from Chu-Bra, where I did think the original point was cheesecake and the stories about flowering youth were just tacked on because the series had to go somewhere.

In the end, Aoki falls in love with Rin, telling himself that he loves her as a person, and not because he's a lolicon. Which seems to be true in the context of the story, although I can see why people would find it still creepy and weird. He turns down Houin-sensei's confession and decides to wait until Rin is older so they can be together, thinking back to Rin telling him that he was born too early and that Reiji and her mother were thirteen years apart in age when they were together. Rin graduates to middle school and Aoki takes a new job, at a middle school, though not Rin's (she goes to an all-girls' school, along with Mimi and Kuro). They don't see each other for three years, and Aoki even stops responding to Rin's text messages. But Rin tells him her sixteenth birthday is coming up, and she wants to see him; Reiji also comes to Aoki and tells him to see her, and vaguely acknowledges the debt he owes Aoki for his self-revelations. Aoki goes to see her, wondering what she looks like, and finds that she...looks exactly the same as ever. They go to a love hotel and have sex anyway, although Rin is hurt and can't go on immediately.

I thought the ending was really good, and I really liked the endings of Mimi's, Kuro's, and Shirai's stories...but then Rin still looked like a ten-year-old girl. The whole thing actually had the potential to be pretty romantic, if still a little disturbing, and to reinforce the idea that Aoki isn't a lolicon. Instead, it reinforced the idea that he *is* a lolicon and also ended the series on a "little girl cheesecake" note instead of the serious note that all the other arcs ended on. Sixteen-year-old girl and guy in his thirties is still a little whatever, but nothing like ten-year-old-girl and guy in his thirties. But even though we were told that three years had passed, and even though Kuro and Mimi and even Aoki all looked different, the feeling I got from the final scene was that Rin was still ten and Aoki had decided to do a little girl after all. Which, you know, wasn't what I wanted. I wanted the series to end on the high ground. So I was kind of disappointed. 

I almost feel like Watashiya or the publishers were afraid that the later parts were too deconstructiony towards lolicons, who, after all, were almost certainly the chief audience for this series, so they threw in the ending to comfort the lolicons, while also avoiding the fallout that would have resulted from having Aoki sex up the ten-year-old Rin for real. By this point, though, even though I still thought Rin was pretty cute, the previous realism of the series changed the way I perceived this scene, bringing me out of fuwa fuwa fantasy mode and into real life mode, and causing my disappointment.

Does this series deserve to be so reviled? No, not when you just consider on its own merits, although I can see why people don't like the way it affects anime's image. (I heard a radio story about Japan officially outlawing child pornography featuring real children, which I somehow thought had been done a long time ago. The story specified that the law wouldn't affect the manga industry and added that representatives from the industry had said such a law would "destroy the industry". Which makes the whole anime and manga fandom sound like a bunch of pedophiles. Which some of us might be, but is it fair that people who have nothing to do with that kind of thing get stuck with that image?) It's the kind of thing that's incredibly controversial no matter which medium or what country it comes from, and it makes some missteps that are akin to tripping and falling while carrying nuclear waste. But it does have some artistic merit, which surprised me as much as anyone, and I don't regret reading it, although I'm definitely deleting it from my Kindle before I try to pass through customs.
