* Thoughts on Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Begun <2014-09-17 Wed> in first impressions file.
** <2014-09-17 Wed>
I bought the manga a while back and kind of ignored it. I did read it, but I didn't really think about it much or anything. Since I keep hearing about it, I decided to give it another read and was a lot more impressed this time.

Despite its cute characters and magical girl setting, Madoka is from a series written by Gen Urobuchi, author of the Fate/Zero light novels. (So you know nothing good is happening.) I believe the anime came first. The main character is Madoka Kaname, who, along with her friend Sayaka Miki, encounters a weird mascot character named Kyuubei as recent transfer student Homura Akemi tries to blow it up while wearing a weird costume. Before Kyuubei even shows up, Homura warns Madoka not to make any drastic changes in her life.

Madoka and Sayaka are rescued by Mami Tomoe, a third-year student at their school and a magical girl as well. Kyuubei tries to convince the girls to become magical girls, telling them they can have one miraculous wish in return, but Mami advises caution and has them do ride-alongs with her to learn the ropes before they make any decisions. The enemies of the magical girls are Witches, who create barriers and familiars and suck out energy by causing random homicides, accidents, and suicides. Mami saves a woman about to jump off the roof of the hospital and defeats the witch inside, gaining its power to recharge her magic. 

While Madoka and Sayaka try to think of what wish is worth all of this, they go about their daily lives, believing Homura is a jerk who wants to poach Mami's territory. (It doesn't help that she never talks to anyone about anything.) Mami tells them that her entire family died in a massive car wreck; as she lay in the flames, the twisted metal hulk around her, Kyuubei appeared and made her an offer. Mami became a magical girl in return for having her life saved. 

Sayaka has been visiting a boy in the hospital and bringing him CDs, since he used to play the violin. One day, she and Madoka go together to visit and find the hospital has a Witch inside. Since it hasn't grown to its full size yet, Madoka goes to get Mami. Mami binds Homura with a spell to keep her from poaching. On her way upstairs with Mami, Madoka says she's decided to become a magical girl in return for being able to make an impact on the world, and that she and Mami will work together. However, Mami is brutally killed by the Witch, a giant ball-shaped monster that bites her head off and devours it. With Mami dead, the magic holding Homura evaporates, and she rescues Madoka and Sayaka.

Madoka decides not to become a magical girl, and Homura is pleased to hear it. She tells Madoka that if you die inside a Witch's barrier, your body disappears. In Mami's case, there were no relatives either, so she'll probably be totally forgotten, as is the lot of all magical girls. Madoka say she won't forget Homura, who saved her life, and Homura seems moved. Meanwhile, Sayaka decides to make a wish for the boy she's been seeing, and becomes a magical girl. 

On her way home, Madoka is attacked by bewitched people, who try to commit suicide by making chlorine gas from cleaning chemicals. Madoka dumps out their bucket, and they turn on her, but she's rescued by Sayaka, now a magical girl. We see Kyuubei talking to another girl named Kyouko who plans to move in on Mami's territory and isn't afraid of a newbie.

The series reminds me a lot of Eva. Even though Card Captor Sakura was more stylish than Sailor Moon, it wasn't dark like this. Mami's death scene was especially shocking and dark, all the more so because of how minimalist it is—you really have to look to see that Mami's corpse is headless, and that a head with her trademark curly hair ringlets is dangling from the creature's teeth. In token of this darkness, no one uses a cute pink staff as a weapon. Sayaka has a sword, Homura has a bow, and Mami has a musket that looks like an arquebus, as well as a hand cannon blunderbuss sort of deal. 

Kyuubei is sort of like cute mascot Gendou Ikari. He pushes and pushes on the girls to make contracts with him, despite knowing how dangerous this line of work is. He never expresses the tiniest remorse over Mami's death; if anything, it makes him push harder on Sayaka, and he abandons Madoka after she makes it clear that she's not going for it. I think one of the most tragic aspects of the series will end up being that they didn't let Homura kill him. Mami admits to Madoka just before she dies that she's always completely terrified whenever she goes into battle, similar to how Shinji was the first giant robot pilot to go berserk, suffer a nervous breakdown, and burst into tears. It almost seems like Madoka and Mami's heart-to-heart threw Mami off kilter emotionally and contributed to her death. 

The series also dispenses with the usual noble reasons for magical girls to do what they do; the magical girls in this series receive miraculous wishes as a sign-on bonus, and they get rewards for killing Witches, giving a disturbing profit motive to the whole thing. Kyouko is clearly motivated by profit, and Kyuubei seems to have preyed on that. And the Witches don't make people yell at their friends or create big layers of cherry blossoms or become the heroine's mirror image and develop a crush on her brother. They're brutal, like the less savory servants of Fate/Stay Night (e.g Caster, Stay Night's Rider under Shinji). That mob at the end was terrifying, especially when you look at cute innocent little Madoka standing alone against them. In fact, this series sort of reminds me of someone's attempt to cross over Fate/Stay Night, Eva, and Card Captor Sakura. (I'm sure the Fate connection is real since Gen Urobuchi worked on Fate/Zero, and every magical girl series nowadays owes a little bit to Card Captor Sakura.)

At the same time, it doesn't revel in darkness by being pointlessly brutal or screaming "I am a deconstruction". Like Eva and Fate/Stay Night, it seems to be a story about morality and desire. Like Eva, it treats the morality of using children as soldiers. And the characters are well-developed so far. The way they react to Mami's death was especially interesting and believable; Sayaka screams at Homura that that crystal is Mami's, insisting that Mami isn't dead; Madoka suddenly bursts in tears at breakfast the next day, saying breakfast tastes so good when you're alive to eat it; and even Homura seems shaken by the reminder of the fate that probably awaits her. 

The characters are super-cute, too. They could be the cast of a moe yon-koma: Madoka would be like Yuru Yuri's Akari or Hidamari's Yuuno; Sayaka would be like Yuru Yuri's Yui or K-On's Ritchan; Mami would be the oneesan character; and Homura would be the taciturn character. Except they're stuck in a horrible world of death and evil and despair. 

[cont'd.] I looked up some info and got some accidental spoilers, and of course, nothing good happens at all in this series. 

The anime did come first; Shaft's Akiyuki Shinbo (who also worked on Bakemonogatari) decided to do a magical girl deconstruction and got the sign-off from his producer. He hired Gen Urobuchi to write the story, not knowing just how horrible it would be in this man's hands, and Ume Aoki of Hidamari Sketch to do the character designs. It's so rare nowadays for such a thing to happen that I didn't quite trust my memories. 

I looked back at the very first scene of the manga, where Madoka dreams about Homura before they meet, and it seems like it's a premonition of how Madoka becomes a magical girl. After Mami's death, even though Madoka berates herself for cowardice, she has thoroughly decided not to become a magical girl. In the dream at the beginning, Homura is being attacked by something and apparently will die. Kyuubei talks to Madoka and says she can change destiny and it was too big a job for Homura alone. We see Homura screaming at Madoka in desperation—probably begging her not to listen to Kyuubei and to save herself. Then Madoka wakes up.

This is probably a premonition: Homura ends up trapped in some deadly situation, and Kyuubei manipulates Madoka into becoming a magical girl by telling her she can save Homura. We know Madoka has kind of a low self-esteem (not pathological, not yet at Shinji levels, but she considers herself pretty useless and ordinary, and she takes a turn for the Shinji after Mami's death), which might make her vulnerable to various manipulations; her low self-esteem was her main motivator for saying she wanted to become a magical girl and team up with Mami. She wanted to do something important and learn to be cool like Mami.  Kyuubei also tells Madoka that she would be an extraordinarily powerful magical girl and her soul gem (the gems that hold a magical girl's power, and get recharged from the Witches' grief seeds) would be amazing. So at the very least, Kyuubei leans on Madoka when she sees Homura in danger. But given how manipulative he seems to be (mascot Gendou Ikari, right?), he might even set up the danger to Homura himself. After all, he bears her no love after she tried to kill him. 

I find I am both drawn to and horrified by this series. I think I may have felt the same about Eva if I'd been a fan of the super robot genre before I saw it. I'm kind of a fan of the magical girl genre, even though actually not really because I mostly just like Card Captor Sakura. (A lot of them are too cheesy even for me, or too formulaic, or the characters aren't interesting enough, and let's not even talk about Nanoha; that was a massive disappointment to someone expecting Card Captor Sakura but with awareness of the otaku segment of the audience. By the way, Shinbo supposedly worked on Nanoha too.) I guess maybe the horror comes from the genuine adorableness of these characters. They really are excellent moe girls. But death and cruelty and other horrible things are happening, the kinds of things I usually go to moe to escape from. At the same time, the series is so compelling so far that I'm kind of unavoidably drawn to it. Urobuchi is a good writer—I can see that just from the little bits of Madoka and Fate/Zero that I've seen so far. 

I'm nearly done with One Week Friends—only two more episodes to go—and after that I think I might go for the anime of Madoka, since it's only twelve episodes. I think this is a series whose time has come for me.
** <2015-01-24 Sat>
I ended up not watching Madoka after I said I would before, mostly because of what I wrote above about it being somewhat horrifying: after I wrote that, I realized that that was exactly how I felt, and that I didn’t really want to feel that way while watching a series, so I moved on to other things. But again, I keep hearing how good it is, and I now have some personal experience to back that up. Plus, I’m so tired of being disappointed. It feels like a giant string of steadily mounting disappointments ever since Fate/Zero: we had Unlimited Blade Works, which is pretty good so far but not as good as Fate/Zero, and it took a season break right as things were getting good; we had Gochiusa (that was before Fate/Zero, and anyway it looks better and better as I think back on it); then we had Hanayamata, which exponentially decayed after about Episode 5; then Little Busters, which, blegh, see what I wrote about it; then I watched one episode of a bunch of disappointing shows (Milky Holmes, Love Live); then we had Nagi no Asukara, which I kind of cooled off with after I found out it was from the Hanasaku Iroha people; then a brief respite with the pretty good Asobi ni Iku yo; and now B Gata H Kei, which I actually paid for, otherwise I would’ve quit watching it about five episodes ago. I only paid $12, fortunately, but when I own something I tend to feel obligated to watch all of it, even if I don’t really like it, as in the case of ef: A Tale of Memories. Though with ef, I kept hoping it would get better because it kept on showing signs of wanting to. I don’t see B Gata H Kei ever getting any better than it is now.

With that context, I decided to watch Madoka. I started from Episode 2 since I have a fansub of Episode 1 hanging around that I watched a few years ago. The manga actually took some liberties with the anime, and not just by making the art ever so slightly less cute and changing the Witches’ labyrinths, which would be like impossible to duplicate in the timeline of a manga publication. In the anime, the Witches’ labyrinths are totally the kind of thing that Shaft would do: they’re these random agglomerations of warm colors with sepia-toned highlights, the shapes flat like paper cutouts, filled with bizarre asymmetrical creatures. The thing that kills Mami looks like a clown face drawn on a black sock with a ball inside it. They look like the work of Lane Smith, illustrator of /The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales/, which was popular when I was in first and second grade.

The anime also doles out the darkness a bit more carefully than the manga does; it’s as if the manga-ka, knowing beforehand how dark things would get, unconsciously let that taint the earlier chapters when it was supposed to be somewhat undercover. As part of this, it’s a bit more vague about Mami’s background, though you still get the same information as the manga; it’s just revealed more subtly, and Mami never tells the whole story to Madoka and Sayaka.

The anime story moves a bit faster, too; by the end of Episode 4, we’re already up to where the first volume of the manga ended, with Kyouko scoping out Mami’s territory, making sinister remarks about her intentions towards Sayaka. I foresee some kind of /Lord of the Flies/ thing going on between them, but maybe Homura will step in and do something. Homura so far seems like an emotionally damaged person, perhaps along the lines of a child soldier, who suppresses her emotions so she can keep acting as a magical girl, but at the same time she has sort of a code of honor that would preclude her from sniping at newbies. When Mami offers her a hit of the grief seed (could it be this show also contains an addiction metaphor?) and Homura refuses, Mami seems to think she just hates sharing or thinks it’s beneath her to take someone’s leftovers, but given the big spoiler I know, that magical girls whose soul gems run out of power turn into Witches themselves, it seems more likely that Homura was trying to be honorable by letting Mami keep what she earned through her own efforts, knowing what’s at stake if Mami’s soul gem runs low.

As an aside, the weapons are also slightly different from the manga. In the anime, Mami can create a bunch of muskets (which actually look more like early rifles, like the Kentucky Longrifle, with their long muzzles and short stocks [there’s even a scene in Episode 1 where you can see up the barrel a little and you can see that it’s rifled, so they are rifles]), each of which has a single shot. And Sayaka’s sword was a thin, straight sword, somewhat like an early rapier or espada ropera (broader than later rapiers, but thinner than a medieval broadsword), but it looks like it’s actually a curved sword in the anime. [In Episodes 5 and 6 you can see it better, and it’s sort of an 18th Century naval saber or cutlass with a full guard around the hilt]

The result of the art style and lighter first few episodes is to make the anime much weirder than the manga. The manga tells a unique story, a dark deconstruction of the magical girl genre, but the anime tells a unique story in a weird, Shaft-like way. Imagine that Bakemonogatari had been adapted to manga, but it eschewed all the weird artistic flourishes—the giant, empty buildings with spiral staircases, the abstract depictions of the kai, the screens full of text that only flash up for one frame, the head tilting. It would still be kind of weird, just because the novels were weird and the manga would still be an adapatation of the novels. But it would feel more conventional. That’s essentially the divide between the Madoka anime and manga, although not nearly so pronounced, since the Madoka anime isn’t nearly as weird as either the novels or anime of Bakemonogatari.

So far the anime is just as good as the manga, though. Mami’s death scene had the same minimalism as it did in the manga; it even lacks the shadowy head with Mami’s ring-shaped curls, just showing the monster bite her around the head and then her lifeless body falling to the ground. One interesting point that wasn’t in the manga is the life advice that Madoka receives from her father. After her mother stumbles home drunk from a night of drinking with the fellas, mumbling about work as they drag her to bed, Madoka and her father have a talk in the kitchen over cocoa, and Madoka asks why her mother loves her work so much, since it wasn’t her dream to work at a company. Madoka’s father tells her that he thinks her mother just loves realizing her full potential; even if it wasn’t her dream to work at a company, the fact that doing so allows her to push herself to the limits and achieve something charges her up. Madoka takes this to heart in her decision to become a magical girl alongside Mami, but after Mami’s death, the whole thing becomes a dark parody of scenes in other magical girl shows where the heroine receives life advice from a parent and applies it to some problem relating to her magical girl exploits. 
** <2015-01-27 Tue>, Episodes 5 and 6
Madoka keeps on being a good show in Episodes 5 and 6, where things really heat up. Sayaka begins hunting for witches, telling Madoka that she has no regrets over becoming a magical girl and her only regret is that she could have decided sooner and possibly stopped Mami’s death from happening. Madoka, worried about Sayaka, comes along on Sayaka’s hunt just as she and Sayaka went along on Mami’s. Sayaka finds a weak familiar and intends to kill it to stop it from hurting anyone, but loses it when she’s attacked by Kyouko, who angrily says it’s stupid to kill it now and she should let it devour a few people and become a real witch so she can get a decent grief seed from it. This angers Sayaka, who believes in justice and saving people, so she and Kyouko fight, but Sayaka is at a huge disadvantage both due to her lesser experience and because Kyouko has a spear and it can split up into a chain spear, so her reach is much greater than Sayaka’s with her saber.

Sayaka is only saved when Homura appears. Earlier, Madoka scheduled a meeting with Homura and begged her to team up with Sayaka to keep her safe, but Homura refused, saying she was sorry that she hadn’t tried as hard to keep Sayaka from making a contract as she had with Madoka, and also that she’s sorry that Sayaka was likely to get killed with the mindset of wanting to save people and help others, but she couldn’t do it. But Homura, who Kyuubei described to Kyouko as “an irregularity” whose origin he knows nothing about when she asked him earlier, does appear and knocks out Sayaka. She and Kyouko posture a bit, but when Homura offers to let Kyouko leave, Kyouko takes the offer and leaves.

Sayaka and Madoka get in a big argument when Madoka tries to convince Sayaka to parley with Kyouko next time they meet instead of fighting, and Sayaka insists you can’t talk to people like that and she now knows Mami was an exception among magical girls. Sayaka lumps Homura and Kyouko together, revealing that she thought Homura just lurked in the shadows until Mami died and then poached the witch, and won’t hear out Madoka when Madoka tries to explain what really happened. Sayaka asks if Madoka would still think fighting was so bad if the witches were coming after her parents or her little brother, and storms off, angry.

Meanwhile, Homura and Kyouko meet up in an arcade where Kyouko is playing Dance Dance Revolution. Homura asks Kyouko to leave Sayaka to her and not to harm her, and says she’ll take care of Sayaka and let Kyouko have the city. Kyouko asks why, and Homura says people like her make better magical girls than idealistic people like Kyouko, but also mentions that some disaster called Walpurgisnacht (the night of witches in German mythology) is coming in about two weeks, and Kyouko realizes if she and Homura team up, they can probably defeat it.

I have a feeling Kyouko doesn’t make it to Walpurgisnacht, and Homura tries to take it on alone, leading to the situation in Madoka’s dream in the first episode. Kyuubei certainly keeps up the persistent bugging in this episode: not only does it keep reminding Madoka that she can become a magical girl, it also tells Sayaka that Kyouko has vastly more experience than she does and defeating her will be difficult, but that Madoka’s innate power would allow her to overcome Kyouko’s experience, so that if Sayaka is ever in real trouble, Madoka can make a contract and come in to save her.  

Madoka talks to her mother about her fight with Sayaka and says she doesn’t know what to do. It seems like whenever Madoka asks her parents for advice, it always turns into a disaster somehow. Madoka’s mother says she should try to do Sayaka a favor by pushing her into disaster as soon as possible so she realizes the error of her ways, like the idea that your programs should throw an exception right at the site of the issue.

Sayaka goes to the hospital and finds that Kamijou-kun has been discharged. She goes to his house to see him, but chickens out at the door and is waylaid by Kyouko as she tries to leave. Kyouko taunts her, saying she should have broken his arms and legs so he’d be dependent on her, which makes Sayaka angry. They go to a bridge to fight again. Kyuubei departs and brings Madoka; Homura also arrives, asking Kyouko what the hell. Sayaka gets out her soul gem to fight, but Madoka, acting on her mother’s advice, grabs it and throws it on a truck passing underneath. Sayaka passes out, dead, and Homura panics and chases the truck, using her short-range teleportation to catch up. Kyuubei reveals that when girls become magical girls, it destroys their real bodies and creates artificial ones which are tougher than normal humans and which can be healed with magic. Their souls are captured inside the soul gems, so if the soul gem is further than about 100 meters from the body, the body has no soul and can’t operate. Kyouko and Madoka are both horrified, but Kyuubei can’t understand why humans are so attached to their frail bodies and why they don’t see the benefits of their new bodies for combat. Homura manages to get the soul gem back to Sayaka, who revives and seems very shaken.

The story keeps on getting more and more interesting; although I do still see the Eva comparison that I mentioned earlier (and that other people have brought up), the overall feel is closer to Fate/Stay Night, especially the clash between Sayaka’s ideals and Kyouko’s brutal pragmatism, which mirrors the clash between Shirou and Archer in Unlimited Blade Works. The animation was beautifully fluid in their fight scene. Madoka also brings an interesting twist to the moral question by being essentially a pacifist who believes in peace, and Homura is sort of like Rin in that she seems to be essentially good despite her adaptation to the brutal world of witch fighting.

Another interesting aspect is that Madoka still hasn’t become a magical girl, even though she’s ostensibly the main character. She’s exerted very little influence on events, although she did twice act on her parents’ advice with drastic results. (Her father’s advice led her to tell Mami she would become a magical girl just so Mami wouldn’t have to be alone; the emotional turmoil that caused in Mami may well have led to her death. Her mother’s advice led her to throw away Sayaka’s soul gem; it remains to be seen whether the end result of that will be good or bad, but there’s no denying it’s drastic, when even Kyouko is shocked and angry.) That would be weird if they pushed it off to the very last episode, or even if she never actually does it; then the title, “Magical Girl Madoka Magica”, would become ironic.

The voice cast is full of stars. Madoka is voiced by Aoi Yuuki, who voiced Mio Aoyama in Kami Nomi and Alice Blanche in Ikoku Meiro no Croisée. Sayaka is voiced by Eri Kitamura (Karen-chan! That explains her love for justice). Homura is voiced by Chiwa Saito with essentially her Hitagi voice, and it works great. Kyouko is voiced by Ai Nonaka, and although you can hear it’s her, she adds this shrill, crazed note to Kyouko’s voice that fits the character perfectly. Fuko and Konoka never sounded crazy like this. Additionally, Mami was played by Kaori Mizuhashi, whose name I remember but whose significant parts I never can. (She did play Ogiue in Genshiken II—not Second Season, the anime had the original Genshiken split into two parts.) 
** <2015-01-29 Thu> Episodes 7, 8, 9
The major mysteries of the story are revealed in these episodes: what Kyuubei is, the nature of magical girls and witches, and important parts about Kyouko’s and Homura’s pasts.

After recovering her soul gem, Sayaka is depressed and horrified that she agreed to become, as Kyouko puts it, a “zombie”. Kyouko, who is also unhappy and tells off Kyuubei when it comes to her, invites Sayaka to the ruins of a burned church, where she tells Sayaka how she became a magical girl. Her father was a priest of some kind, but he developed his own ideas about morality and started preaching things that aren’t in the Bible, which led his church to lose all its parishioners and the main church to excommunicate him. (He’s not Roman Catholic since he has a wife and child, but there are denominations which are closely based on Roman Catholicism that allow their clergy to marry.) Kyouko knew that what he was saying was good, and felt that if people would only listen, they would see that for themselves, so she made a wish for people to listen to her father in return for becoming a magical girl. But when her father found out, he was angry that people were only listening to him because of magic. He eventually went crazy and burned the church down with his entire family inside; only Kyouko survived. 

Although Kyouko tells the whole story, with some very Bakemonogatari-ish background art (similar to when Hitagi recounts her past during Hitagi Crab, or when Rouka talks about hers in Hanamonogatari), the sequence is framed by two minor scenes that, nonetheless, do an amazing job of making Kyouko’s and Sayaka’s values, shaped by their upbringings, real and visceral. Kyouko, who is constantly eating, has a bag of apples when she brings Sayaka to the church. She gives one to Sayaka. (We later see that this is Kyouko’s way of offering friendship: she gives the other person some of whatever food she’s eating at the time.) Sayaka, mistrustful and suspicious, tosses it away, and Kyouko becomes very angry and grabs her by the neck, telling her not to waste food, before picking up the apple and dusting it off. After we hear her story, we find out that Kyouko is now an orphan and essentially lives on the streets. She’s constantly eating because she needs the energy, and she can’t stand wasting food because for her, it’s not trivial to get more. 

Kyouko says that she told Sayaka her story as a cautionary tale of what happens when you try to use magical powers for other people, and that things are much simpler if you stop caring about others and use magic for personal gain. Sayaka, though, still won’t hear of it, and asks Kyouko where she got those apples from, implying that Kyouko stole them and that she disapproves. (Because she’s a street urchin, and I definitely see her more as the thief type than as the enjou kousai type.)

Things get even worse for Sayaka when Kyousuke Kamijo, the boy she made her wish for, comes back to school. Sayaka is too shy to speak to him. Hitomi, her and Madoka’s other friend, invites Sayaka out after school and tells her that she also likes Kamijou and that she’s going to confess her love to him, but as a courtesy to Sayaka, who was his childhood friend, she’ll wait one day and let Sayaka have a chance to preempt her. Sayaka, knowing she won’t be able to do it, collapses in Madoka’s arms, crying and saying that Hitomi is going to steal him from her.

Madoka goes along with Sayaka again on a witch hunt. Sayaka almost screws up, and Kyouko rescues her, but Sayaka goes berserk and hacks apart the witch, screaming and chopping in a spray of blood, reminiscent of Eva Unit 01’s berserk attack in Episode 19. She gives the grief seed to Kyouko, saying she doesn’t want to be in debt to someone like that, and wanders off.

In Episode 8, Kyouko and Homura meet at Homura’s flat (it looks like it’s in the middle of London, not Tokyo) to discuss Walpurgisnacht. Homura has mapped out where it will appear, but when Kyouko asks how she knows, Homura says “Statistics”, leading Kyouko to ask where she got statistics from since it’s never come to their town before, and leading Homura not to answer. (The fact that a middle school girl living on the streets knows enough about statistics to ask that question is pretty impressive.) Kyuubei appears and tells them that Sayaka is going downhill faster than anyone could have predicted and that her soul gem can’t stand to get much darker.

Sayaka stays home from school, and tortures herself afterwards by watching Hitomi confess to Kamijou and apparently start a relationship with him. Madoka goes to Sayaka’s and hears from her parents that Sayaka wasn’t back all night. She goes to look for her. Homura finds Sayaka once again wasting time and energy fighting familiars and tells her to stop that. She tries to give Sayaka a grief seed, but Sayaka refuses her help again. Homura says she just wants to save her, but Sayaka insists that that’s not true, and Homura readily admits that she has no desire to save her, but she does want to spare Madoka any more grief and remove any temptation for Madoka to become a magical girl. Sayaka manages to make Homura so mad that Homura pulls out a grenade (her weapon of choice) to blow Sayaka up. Sayaka is only saved when Kyouko appears and holds Homura back. Kyouko says that wasn’t the plan, but Homura uses her teleportation to escape.

Kyuubei finds Madoka on a park bench and tells her about her natural talent again, saying that if she became a magical girl, she would be so powerful that she would be like a god. Madoka asks if she could even make Sayaka human again, and Kyuubei unhesitantly says yes. Homura finds them and blows away Kyuubei with a .45. Even Madoka, kind as she is, only mildly protests—she may be kind, but she’s not an idiot, and she now knows that Kyuubei plays dirty pool. All Madoka can talk about is finding and helping Sayaka, even though Homura asks her to give Sayaka up for dead. Shockingly, Homura breaks into tears and begs Madoka to just stay happy with her family, asking why that can’t be enough for her and leading Madoka to ask if they’ve met before. When Homura won’t answer, Madoka runs off to find Sayaka. Kyuubei reappears, commenting that even though it has lots of spare bodies, Homura is making it run through them too fast. It eats its own bullet-riddled body and says it knows now what Homura is and she has time magic. 

Sayaka, who is sitting on a train, overhears two guys talking about one’s girlfriend, a woman he doesn’t really care about other than for her looks, who he won’t marry because her looks will be gone in ten years. He says similar highly enlightened things about women, like how they should be like dogs and just sit up and bark happily for their masters. Sayaka confronts him, saying his girlfriend probably loves him and just wants to make him happy, and here he is talking crap about her and comparing her to a dog. She mumbles that this is the kind of thing she was trying to save, and becomes enraged. Kyouko, Homura, and Madoka find her just as she loses it and her soul gem turns completely black, transforming into a grief seed. A witch hatches from the seed. Kyouko grabs Sayaka’s body, despite Homura’s injunction that carrying a lifeless corpse will just slow her down. The three of them manage to escape from the labyrinth. Homura advises them to be careful how they dispose of the corpse as Madoka throws herself on Sayaka’s lifeless body, sobbing inconsolably. Kyouko angrily asks how Homura can even call herself human, and Homura responds that she doesn’t, and asks if Kyouko does.

In Episode 9, we see that Kyouko has been using magic to preserve Sayaka’s body. Kyuubei asks why she’s wasting her precious magic to preserve a lifeless body, since, as far as it knows, nothing can bring back a soul gem that’s turned into a witch. Kyouko asks if that means it’s possible, and Kyuubei says it might be, but it would be beyond its knowledge.

Madoka can barely stand walking to school with Hitomi, who prattles on about visiting Sayaka later and how Sayaka is probably not very happy with her. Kyouko summons Madoka with telepathy to come talk to her. She tells Madoka it might be possible to bring Sayaka back, and that maybe if she hears a friend’s voice, they might even get lucky and defeat the witch only to have Sayaka’s soul gem pop out, like those stories where love and friendship conquer all that Kyouko used to like. Neither Kyouko nor Madoka seem to really believe things will be this easy, but they’re desperate enough to try it.

Madoka properly introduces herself to Kyouko, who says “Oh man, you’re totally going to cramp my style” before introducing herself and responding to Madoka’s offer of a handshake by placing a candy bar in Madoka’s hand. On the way over, Madoka asks about the deal with her and Homura, and Kyouko says they just agreed to team up because in a few days, a really powerful and huge witch called Walpurgisnacht is going to come to town, and since it’s too powerful for one magical girl alone, she and Homura teamed up to take it on. Madoka talks about how guilty she feels for not making a contract earlier so she could have prevented what happened to Sayaka, but Kyouko gives her the speech about how dangerous it is to make wishes for other people, and how dumb it is to take on life-or-death risks when you really don’t have to. Madoka is about to ask what Kyouko wished for, when they reach the labyrinth of Sayaka’s wish.

Inside the labyrinth is an orchestra of classical musicians, conducted by Kamijo, and the witch itself is a multi-armed creature armed with Sayaka’s sword and wearing the bow from her school uniform on its chest. Kyouko makes a shield for Madoka while Madoka talks to the witch and tries to get Sayaka back. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work; the witch breaks the barrier and grabs Madoka, making Kyouko realize that none of Madoka’s words are getting through. Kyouko rescues Madoka, but takes a hit. Homura arrives, and Kyoko orders her to take Madoka and leave the witch to her. Homura does so, and Kyouko prepares her final strike, asking God to please give her a happy dream, since her life has been so hard so far.

With both Sayaka and Kyouko dead, Madoka spends all night up crying. Kyuubei shows up on her windowsill and explains the setup when Madoka asks. It turns out it’s an alien—an Incubator (in /kyuubei/ ta in Japanese). Its species is trying to prevent the heat death of the universe, which, from what I gather, is essentially the following: in classical physics, energy is conserved, meaning it is never created or destroyed, but only changes form. But according to thermodynamics, energy is never transformed with 100% efficiency—some is always lost to heat. Kyuubei gives the not very good example of a bonfire, in which the heat it gives off is less than the amount of energy required to grow the trees, and also ties the whole thing up with entropy. The principle is that many forms of energy, like chemical energy (petroleum, food) and kinetic energy (movement) are highly structured. Petroleum and food have specific molecular structures that make them what they are, while kinetic energy is structured in the sense that its behavior is predictable—if you know just a few simple things about the object being affected by the kinetic energy, you can easily predict future states. Since these are structured forms, they have low entropy. On the other hand, heat is a high entropy form of energy, because it results in random, unpredictable particle motions at the macro level; while each individual particle behaves predictably, the behavior of the system as a whole is unpredictable, whereas an asteroid hurtling along charged with kinetic energy is a very predictable system. Anyway, given that a) energy is never created, b) energy is always changing form, and c) whenever energy changes form, some is lost to heat, the heat death of the universe, as far as I can tell, is the idea that at some point, all energy in the universe will be heat, and so useless to sustain civilizations. The Incubators somehow figured out that the process of a soul gem turning into a grief seed, and a magical girl becoming a witch, released a bunch of energy that hadn’t just been transformed, but had actually come into being from nowhere. This energy is connected to human emotion, so the Incubators chose to target emotionally charged pubescent girls.

Madoka asks why they would do such a horrible thing, and Kyuubei tries to frame it as a sacrifice for the greater good, saying that when humans expand into space, they’ll want to find a universe teeming with life. (In other words, Star Trek, where there’s a new alien on every planet, is cooler than real life, where the other planets are all lifeless rocks, is Kyuubei’s argument.) It doesn’t understand why it’s such a problem to sacrifice a few humans for this purpose, although it does seem to understand that it is a problem, because it mentions how the always react like this. Madoka accuses Kyuubei of tricking them, but Kyuubei tries to punt and says it would have told them all of this if they’d asked, but they never did. That may be true, since it did tell Madoka everything after she asked, but it’s still underhanded because it targets young girls, manipulates their emotions by telling them how cool it is to be a magical girl or whatever else they need to hear, constantly badgers them and gives them the hard sell, and never mentions that there could possibly be any downside. Witness how it follows Madoka home, sleeps in her bed, and meanwhile keeps telling her how cool it is to be a magical girl and how powerful she would be, playing on her belief in her own mediocrity. If Mami hadn’t counseled caution, Madoka and Sayaka might both have succumbed a lot sooner. For all we know, Kyuubei had Mami killed because she was getting in the way.

After all, there is the next scene (after Kyuubei departs with the very unconvincing sales pitch “If you ever want to die for the universe’s sake, call me”), in which Kyuubei shows up at Homura’s flat. Homura, who realizes how thoroughly they’ve been manipulated, asks why it got Kyouko killed, and Kyuubei says Kyouko was in the way. It needed Homura to be the only one left to fight Walpurgisnacht, in order to force Madoka into making a contract. Since Kyuubei was willing to kill Kyouko to make Madoka a magical girl, it seems plausible that it would have killed Mami—although I’m not sure if it did, because that would actually have worked against its plan since Madoka was ready to make a contract for Mami’s sake.

Although Kyuubei has had everything its own way so far—to the extent that it slipped that hint to Homura and Kyouko about Sayaka’s decline so that Kyouko would become concerned and go to her death—I kind of think it will backfire in the end. It seems to have forgotten that Madoka, as nice as she is, really doesn’t like it by now, and that if she does make a contract, she will become like a god, presuming what it told her was true. So if Kyuubei achieves its goal, it will have just made a god who really doesn’t like it. Usually a bad idea, as we found out in Otorimonogatari.

I tend to think what it told Madoka was true, for two reasons. First of all, Madoka must be special, or Kyuubei and Homura wouldn’t be fighting over her so much. Second, Kyuubei doesn’t seem to ever actually lie. It hides things, it talks over things, it prettifies things with marketing, and it manipulates emotions like hell, but as far as I can remember, it’s never actually lied. The closest it ever came was when it was talking to Kyouko about bringing Sayaka back from witchdom, and it was careful to say that it just didn’t know whether such a thing was possible or not, so it might be possible. But when it spoke to Madoka about how powerful she would become, it never hesitated, never waffled, never prevaricated; it told her directly, without hesitation, that she would be godlike and so powerful that she could even annul Sayaka’s contract and turn her back into a human, which Kyuubei claimed it was incapable of doing. If Madoka really becomes more powerful than the Incubators themselves and gains the ability to annul magical girl contracts, what’s to stop her from nuking Walpurgisnacht, nuking the Incubators, and annulling the contracts of every magical girl in the world, or at least her own and Homura’s? Since Kyuubei claims it knows so very little about what Madoka will be capable of as a magical girl, it seems highly risky to think it’ll be able to just wait for her to go witch and collect the energy, given that she knows what a freaking slimeball it is.

At this point, it seems fairly clear that Homura is a time traveler. She probably knows where Walpurgisnacht will land because she’s seen it happen in a bunch of timelines, and she’s used statistics over the data from all those timelines. She probably also knew and loved Madoka. Madoka is the only thing that shakes her, the only thing that’s ever made her show even a little emotion. (Well, she also freaked out when Madoka threw Sayaka’s soul gem off the bridge, but that was nothing compared to her sobbing and falling to her knees, begging Madoka to go back to her family and forget Sayaka.) Homura is weirdly like Fate/Zero’s Kiritsugu Emiya: she has time magic, and uses guns and grenades to fight. Their cool personalities are also somewhat similar. Her time traveler aspect is somewhat like Fate/Stay Night’s Archer, although I don’t think she’s future Madoka.

I’m surpassingly glad I decided to watch Madoka; I definitely haven’t enjoyed a show this much since Fate/Zero.  
** <2015-01-30 Fri> Episode 10
Episode 10 takes a break from the main story and shows us Homura’s past. (I should say “past”, since it involves time travel.) I didn’t think it was possible, but the show somehow got even darker in these episodes, not by just layering on horror after horror (though it does get pretty horrific), but by creating something beautiful and then destroying it.

Homura began as an adorable shy girl with glasses and braids, who had been in the hospital due to a heart condition and missed half a year of school. The progression mirrors her appearance at Madoka’s school in Episode 1: first she arrives and introduces herself, looking happy and friendly instead of stone-faced and cold. The other students surround her and overwhelm her with questions, but she’s rescued by Madoka, who, as the Nurse’s Office Aide, was informed that Homura has to visit the infirmary for medicine during breaks. Madoka comments on Homura’s name, making Homura say she hates it since it’s so weird. Madoka says she likes it, it’s cool and makes her think of someone flaming with passion. Homura says that’s not her at all, and Madoka says she just has to become cool to match her name.

On her way home, Homura falls into a witch’s labyrinth, but is rescued by Madoka, who is already a magical girl, and Mami. (Madoka fights with a bow.) Madoka became a magical girl just a week earlier, and Mami has been training her so they have a chance to defeat Walpurgisnacht. 

Homura starts to tag along with Madoka and Mami, and she develops a friendship with Madoka. In the end, Mami is killed by Walpurgisnacht; Madoka is able to overcome it, but she is also killed in the process. As she lays dying, she tells Homura that she regards saving Homura from the witch as the best thing she’s ever done. Homura, sobbing, says she wishes Madoka would have put her power into something better instead of saving her. Kyuubei appears and does it usual thing, telling Homura how she can have a wish. Homura wishes to go back and redo everything starting from her rescue, but change things so that instead of Madoka protecting her, she protects Madoka, and in return, she becomes a magical girl.

This time, Homura immediately jumps on Madoka and takes her hands, saying excitedly that she’s also a magical girl now. Madoka and Mami train Homura, who is clumsy and weak, but who manages to learn how to fight and how to use her magic to stop time. Homura also goes online and finds out how to make bombs, and manages to defeat a witch by stopping time and leaving a bomb underneath it. But Madoka and Mami once again fail to defeat Walpurgisnacht.

Homura once again travels back in time and this time tells Madoka that magical girls turn into witches. Sayaka doesn’t believe her and thinks she’s in league with Kyouko and just wants to break them up. Sayaka is also against fighting with Homura because of her bombs; Mami’s Kentucky long rifles and Madoka’s bow put them out of range, but Sayaka’s sword forces her to get in close and she isn’t comfortable with bombs going off. Mami asks if Homura can use any other weapon, and Homura says she’ll figure something out. She stops time and sneaks into a JSSDF base, taking some guns and grenades.

Sayaka turns into a witch, and Homura, Madoka, Mami, and Kyouko fight her. Mami is so horrified with this discovery that she loses her mind and shoots Kyouko, saying that if they’re all going to turn into witches, all they have left is to die. She’s about to shoot Homura, but Madoka shoots her first. Madoka and Homura agree to defeat Walpurgisnacht together.

They do defeat Walpurgisnacht, but both use up too much power. As they lay dying, their soul gems turning black, Madoka says she’s out of grief seeds and Homura jokes that now that they’ve saved the world together, they can become witches together and destroy this terrible world. However, Madoka pulls out a grief seed and uses it to clear up Homura’s soul gem, saying she lied. She asks Homura to go back in time and stop her from ever becoming a magical girl, and tells Homura she really doesn’t want to turn into a witch. Homura, screaming and crying, shoots her before going back in time to start over again.

Homura tries the direct approach, telling Madoka straight out not to accept any wishes. Madoka holds out until the very end, when we see the scene from Madoka’s nightmare in Episode 1: as Homura is tossed left and right by dark tentacles, Kyuubei works on Madoka, convincing her to become a magical girl in order to save Homura. However, in the process of defeating Walpurgisnacht, Madoka turns into a witch so powerful that Kyuubei estimates it will destroy the entire planet in about ten days. Kyuubei doesn’t care because his species’s energy quota is almost met.

Homura travels back again, now hardened and bitter. She takes off her glasses and unbraids her hair, letting it fly free. She’s concluded that the direct approach will never work, and she’s going to try and protect Madoka indirectly, declaring that Madoka is her only friend. Homura raids the JSSDF weapons lockers again, getting bigger and bigger guns, including a big ass machine gun with a bipod. (I can only assume that magic and her zombie body are what allow her to take the recoil from those things.) We see that during Episode 1, she managed to kill Kyuubei, but another body appeared and it escaped straight into Madoka’s arms.

This episode was intense. Most of its emotion comes from the adorable friendship between Homura and Madoka that we saw develop in the first timeline. Of course, as things go on, their friendship deepens, at least from Homura’s point of view. Now we can understand why Homura had to kill her emotions: not only is she engaged in a brutal and difficult slog, at the end of which she has to watch her best friend die again and again, she also has to overcome her urge to jump at Madoka and happily tell her everything as she did in the second timeline. With the first timeline, and the second to some extent, the episode builds something beautiful—the friendship between Madoka and Homura—and then proceeds to destroy it. Even though it only occupied like ten minutes of screentime, their friendship was more adorable and beautiful than what some series manage to achieve in twelve or thirteen episodes. Chiwa Saito did an amazing job with Homura’s adorable voice during those scenes, too. Madoka is so rarely happy anymore that when I heard her happy voice, for a second I wondered if the actors had changed.

I thought it was interesting that Homura says at the end that Madoka is the only friend she’s ever had. She apparently spent two timelines getting along pretty well with Mami; she even seemed reluctant to fight Mami in the early episodes, since she never busted out her .50 caliber rifle or her grenades. It seems she never got to know Kyouko that well, and it’s obvious why she disliked Sayaka, who seems to always ruin everything, and who mistrusted Homura even back when Homura was a cute braided ill girl and not an emotionless killing machine. Now I see Homura’s statement that she had no desire to save Sayaka and was only doing it for Madoka’s sake in a completely new light; it wasn’t just that she was focused on Madoka to the exclusion of all else, but that she actually disliked Sayaka. She probably knew even before she tracked down Sayaka that Sayaka would never accept her help, but because she was so desperate to spare Madoka, she became angry and tried to kill Sayaka.

Homura’s biggest strength, and also her biggest flaw, seems to be her single-mindedness. She’s so focused on her goal of saving Madoka that she only focuses on Madoka, ignoring other factors that could contribute to her goal, like Sayaka, until they’ve started to run out of control. But her single-mindedness is also what gives her the strength to keep going back in time and trying again, even to the extent of sacrificing her friendship with Madoka. Where someone less single-minded might be tempted to enjoy the good times over and over again while trying to find a way to change the outcome, Homura has the guts to drastically remake the scenario, hoping to drastically change the outcome by doing so. And she’s learning; after Sayaka becomes a magical girl, Homura does realize how important Sayaka is to her goal, and tries to help her by giving her a grief seed, among other things. When that doesn’t work, she tries in desperation to convince Madoka to give up on Sayaka, removing that confounding factor. Unfortunately, Homura’s single-minded focus on managing Sayaka means that Kyuubei is able to blindside her by getting Kyouko killed, which Homura also realizes only after it’s happened. 

I think I’m not alone in saying that Homura is now my favorite character. I was leaning that way anyway, and now it’s just completely cemented. On the other hand, I don’t really like Sayaka. Not that I was ever a huge Sayaka fan, but her purist ideology is really shown up as an impediment to everything that anyone tries to do; Mami puts it best when Sayaka is ranting that Homura is probably just trying to drive a wedge between them by telling them how magical girls turn into witches, and Mami says that Sayaka is the one driving a wedge between them. It seems likely that just after Sayaka became a magical girl, when Madoka asked Homura to team up with her and Homura refused, Homura refused because she knew that Sayaka would never trust her, since she wouldn’t even trust her back when she was open, honest, friendly, and not cold and mysterious and vaguely sinister. And Sayaka, although she has no way of knowing what the outcome will be, drives herself towards witchdom, despite all the warnings and concern of Kyouko, Madoka, and Homura. 
** Character Ranking
*** 1. Homura Akemi
An adorable girl who becomes awesome for the sake of her intense feelings of friendship that I can totally see why doujinshi authors turned into yuri love. (And which are acknowledged to be canonical yuri love in the movie.) 
*** 2. Madoka Kaname
Super cute and a good person. Although Madoka has had little impact up to this point (except in alternate timelines), she’s definitely the character with the best-developed sense of morality. Even though Sayaka yells at her for being naive when she brings up wanting to try diplomacy with Kyouko, it’s really Sayaka’s beliefs which are naive, and Madoka’s which are sophisticated and mature. Madoka essentially believes that there is good even in apparently bad people (which she is correct about, in both Kyouko’s and Homura’s cases), that compromise and cooperation are the way to accomplish things, and that no one can do it all on their own without support. Sayaka apparently believes that certain people are evil, that you should never have anything to do with them at all, and that she can do everything on her own without any support. Although Sayaka means well, her beliefs are naive, and they lead her to a bad end. She should have listened to Madoka.

Plus, I love Madoka’s hair ribbons. Kawaii!
*** 3. Kyouko Sakura
Kyouko turned out pretty good, although I wish there had been a little more of a bridge between her greedy, psychotic behavior in Episodes 5 and 6 and her concern for Sayaka afterwards. Plus, she’s cute, with her fangs and her voice by Ai Nonaka. She kind of reminds me of Lancer from Fate/Stay Night, both her personality and her weapon.

[<2015-04-20 Mon> One of the things I love so much about The Different Story manga is that, if we assume the events of its first volume happened in the main timeline as well, it does provide that bridge between Kyouko’s greedy, psychotic behavior on her first appearance and her later concern for Sayaka. We know from the first volume that Kyouko really is a caring person and that her greedy, violent behavior was something she adopted just to survive her new life on the streets. And Ai Nonaka did such a good job with Kyouko’s voice that I can even hear her speaking when I read The Different Story.]
*** 4. Mami Tomoe
Even though Mami was more of a plot device than a character, I still liked her pretty well, and I considered switching her and Kyouko, but Kyouko got better character development so she wins. The contrast in Mami between being a confident oneechan type and being secretly lonely and constantly scared witless by battle was interesting and effective. Also, I liked her weapon the best. Seeing a magical girl firing a musket, and seeing that her final attack was a giant engraved cannon with the name “Tiro Finale” (which I believe is Italian for “Final Shot”) was the thing that made me go “Oh, this isn’t like other magical girl shows.” Well, at the time I thought it was a musket. I looked up the Pennsylvania longrifle on Wikipedia, and I’m about 90% sure that that’s where the design of Mami’s rifles came from. Not only does the long barrel and short stock look extremely similar and distinctive, you can see in several shots that Mami’s guns are rifled (spiral grooved along the inside of the barrel so that the ammunition rotates on its axis as it flies), so they’re rifles of some kind, not muskets, which are smoothbore. 

[<2015-04-20 Mon> In The Different Story, Mami is fully fleshed out from being a plot device with some character-like features to being an extremely interesting character in her own right, which I loved. And her weapon is still awesome. In fact, it’s even more awesome in The Different Story. And her incredible (if pointlessly long) midair gun fight with Homura was one of the high points of Rebellion. I also like how Mami is consistently shown as the strongest and most combat-effective of the magical girls. She even defeats Homura in Rebellion, with Homura only managing to win by using cheap tricks.]
*** 5. Sayaka Miki
I don’t really like her, as I said above. It was kind of her role to be the spoiler of everything and move the story along. I don’t hate her, but I also can’t really find much to like in her. The absolutely only time she was indecisive was when being decisive could have helped her—when Hitomi gave her the ultimatum about confessing her love to Kamijou. If she had been decisive then, instead of deciding beforehand that Hitomi was going to steal him, things might have gone differently. The rest of the time, she was recklessly decisive, and did her best to have no regrets about it. Her naive sense of morality is similar to Shirou Emiya, but interestingly, the show actually presents the ethical and morally developed Madoka as an alternative voice to Sayaka’s, instead of the morally bankrupt characters who served as counter to Shirou.
** <2015-01-31 Sat> Episode 11
Madoka attends Sayaka’s funeral. A news report on her disappearance describes how her body was found in a hotel, presumably where Kyouko was keeping it as she tried to find a way to restore Sayaka. Madoka returns home and is met by her mother at the door. Her mother asks her if she knows anything about Sayaka’s death, but Madoka claims not to.

Homura and Kyuubei continue their conversation from Episode 9, when Kyuubei acknowledged that it had Kyouko killed. Kyuubei has figured out that Homura is a time traveler and has a hypothesis that Homura’s time traveling has caused multiple timelines and threads of fate to converge on Madoka, which is what’s increased her power to such incredible levels. (So in some sense it really is the power of love, because Homura’s love for Madoka is what led her to such lengths as going back in time and repeating the same month over and over.)

Madoka’s mother and teacher, who we found out know each other in Episode 1, are drinking together and talking about the incident. Madoka’s mother comments that she thinks Madoka knows something about Sayaka’s death, but won’t tell her, and Madoka’s teacher says that just how it is with kids that age—you turn around one day, and they’re suddenly grown up. She mentions that one of the third-years is also missing (Mami, presumably) and how much chaos it’s all causing at the school.

Madoka goes to visit Homura at her flat. Homura seems surprised at her presence. Madoka tells Homura she heard about Walpurgisnacht from Kyouko and asks if she’s in trouble now that Kyouko is gone. Madoka is going to suggest that she make a contract to help Homura, but Homura lies that she can handle Walpurgisnacht alone and only agreed to team up with Kyouko so Kyouko could save face. Madoka acts like she doesn’t believe Homura, and Homura’s façade breaks down; she hugs Madoka, crying, and tells Madoka that she’s a time traveler from the future and that she came back to protect Madoka. She says that to Madoka, she’s just some transfer student who’s only been around for a month, but to her, Madoka is an unspeakably precious friend whom Homura has resolved to save.

Kyuubei comes to visit Madoka again in her room and Madoka once again asks how Kyuubei can treat people like it does. Kyuubei compares it to the way humans treat livestock animals, and tells Madoka that its species came to Earth at the dawn of humanity and nudged humans along to technological advancement. According to Kyuubei, many historical figures were actually magical girls who achieved greatness through their wishes, including Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, and a Japanese figure who I can only guess at being Himiko, a famous priestess from the Yamato Era. (So are we going to get the spinoff, Puella Magi Cleopatra Magica? And does that mean that Gilles de Rais met Kyuubei at some point before he became Caster? [<2015-04-20 Mon> They really do have the Joan of Arc spinoff, Puella Magi Tart Magica.]) Madoka still doesn’t accept Kyuubei’s reasoning, but can’t clearly express why.

Walpurgisnacht’s arrival is heralded by a massive storm that necessitates an evacuation. Homura goes out to fight it with a massive amount of hardware: a field of RPG launchers and bazookas, grenades, missile batteries, machine guns. However, her weaponry isn’t enough, and Walpurgisnacht manages to strike her down.

Madoka’s family goes to a shelter, but Madoka excuses herself to go the bathroom and meets Kyuubei on the roof. Madoka asks Kyuubei if Homura can really defeat Walpurgisnacht on her own, and Kyuubei asks if Madoka would really believe it and says the only way to know is to see for herself. Kyuubei tells Madoka that Homura keeps on trying to save her because if she doesn’t, she’ll give in to despair and turn into a witch. Madoka decides she’s going to go see for herself how Homura is doing. On her way out, her mother appears and stops her, saying she can’t go out and getting so angry she actually slaps Madoka for ignoring how much worry she would cause her and Madoka’s father. Madoka explains that she does understand, because she feels just as worried about her parents and her brother, but that she has to do something to save everyone and she can’t let her mother come with her. Madoka’s mother lets her go.

Homura lies on the ground, her foot trapped under rubble, unable to move as Walpurgisnacht approaches. She’s about to go back in time again, but thinks about Kyuubei’s theory. If she does go back in time, then the weight of Madoka’s destiny will become even heavier, and Madoka becoming a magical girl will be even more inevitable. Her soul gem becomes blacker and blacker as she considers what to do, trying to think her way out of the box she’s trapped in. At that moment, Madoka shows up and tells Homura not to worry. Homura is horrified, thinking that Madoka has already made a contract, but Madoka happily tells Homura to leave it to her.

Even though poor Homura never gets to really have a reunion with Madoka, I’m glad we got at least the scene where she tells Madoka that she’s a time traveler and admits that after repeating the same month with Madoka over and over again, Madoka is far more important to her than she is to the current Madoka. But I do think Homura is important to Madoka too. In some sense, Madoka actually has the power of love and friendship that Sailor Moon and other magical girls constantly bandy about; not because love and friendship make a big beam appear and blow up her enemies, but because she always takes action out of love and friendship, and not for personal gain or some abstract definition of righteousness. Madoka has consistently acted in a way that suggests Homura is included as a friend, such as when she told Homura after Mami’s death that she would never forget her. And now, in the ultimate expression of love and friendship, Madoka is about to make a contract with Kyuubei, even though she knows exactly how bad that is now that’s led to the deaths of Mami, Sayaka, and Kyouko, because it’s the only way to save her family and remaining friends. I don’t really think Madoka has already made a contract, though. Such a dramatic moment has to happen onscreen, I think. 

I had enough time to watch the last episode, but I chose not to. I wanted to really savor the end of the series. Alas that it was so short. Just as I came to realize just how awesome it is, it was almost over.  There’s a movie, too, but Aniplex USA, which I have to give the prize as worst US distributor ever, sells it only on Blu-Ray (which I can’t watch) for around $100. Yes, $100 for a two-hour movie. They also sell the TV series. It comes on three Blu-Rays, each sold separately for about $80. I paid the freaking $150 for the Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari box sets, and thought that was ridiculous; this is just insane. It would be nice if the whole series was available in a BD/DVD bundle for $20 like the Sentai and Funimation releases, but I’d even be okay with an $80 BD/DVD bundle for the whole series, or individual disks for $35 each like back in the days of Geneon. These jerks deserve to have every release they ever license stay in fansubs forever. I do want to see the movie, though, so I think I’ll look for a fansub. 
** <2015-02-01 Sun> Episode 12
Madoka makes her wish—she wishes that witches never existed, and that all magical girls, everywhere and everywhen, will be brought mercy by her own hands so they can keep their hope until the very end.

Kyuubei is shocked by this wish and exclaims that Madoka truly intends to become a god, but such is Madoka’s power that the wish comes true. Walpurgisnacht ceases to exist. Madoka has a chat with Mami and Kyouko (inside her head?) where Mami tells her that with this, she will cease to be a person and become a concept, forgotten by everyone she’s ever known, and Kyouko supports her decision. We see all the magical girls throughout history, including Joan of Arc and Cleopatra; as they lay dying, their soul gems turning black, Madoka appears and removes the blackness, allowing them to die in peace and disappear. Kyuubei and Homura travel forward in time to the end of the universe, and Kyuubei says that such a massive wish will result in Madoka becoming a witch so powerful it can destroy the entire universe, but Madoka is so powerful that she can even cleanse her own soul gem, preventing it from spawning that witch and allowing the universe to continue.

Madoka (inside her head?) shows Sayaka the future of Kyousuke Kamijou, as he goes on to succeed at an important audition and become a great musician. Madoka tells Sayaka that this future, unfortunately, can’t happen anymore, but she wanted to let Sayaka see it. Sayaka says that’s okay, and the only thing that’s bad is that he has a girl who’s too good for him—Hitomi.

Homura floats in a weird space where she’s naked, protesting that everyone in every time will forget Madoka. Madoka appears, also naked, and embraces her, saying that thanks to her new godlike abilities, she finally knows everything Homura went through for her and what a good and true friend Homura is, which is the one good thing about this. She gives Homura her ribbon as a memento and sends Homura into the new timeline that resulted from her wish.

In the new timeline, witches don’t exist. Magical girls still exist, and they fight mysterious beings called wraiths which are also somehow spawned from human emotion. When their soul gems turn black, they disappear peacefully, and Madoka comes down to prevent the soul gem from turning into a grief seed. Mami, Kyouko, and Homura are a team; Sayaka was apparently also their ally, but she just recently disappeared when we come in. Kyouko regrets that she didn’t get the chance to become even better friends with Sayaka, but Homura, who has retained her memories and knows what happened to Sayaka in the other timeline, knows that it was a better fate.

Homura has started wearing Madoka’s ribbon (and looks totally freakin’ adorable in it) and is a little more outgoing and friendly, though she’s still quiet and solemn. One day, she comes across Madoka’s little brother in the park. He’s drawn a picture of Madoka (like the one in her notebook at the beginning) in the sand with a stick, and keeps saying “Madoka, Madoka”. When he sees the ribbon on Homura’s head, he says “Madoka” and reaches for it, but his mother stops him, saying it’s impolite to pull a girl’s hair.

Homura and Madoka’s mother talk for a minute, and Homura tells her that Madoka is sort of an imaginary friend. Madoka’s mother wonders if it’s some kind of anime character. She comments on Homura’s ribbon and says it fits her own taste so well that it looks like something she would have her own daughter wear if she had one. Homura offers to give it to her, but Junko declines.

In the final scene, Homura has finished telling Kyuubei about the original timeline where witches existed. Kyuubei is intrigued, but says there’s no way to know since that timeline was erased. Homura says that’s all right, since she and it didn’t get along in that timeline and a lot of things have improved. She gets up to go fight the wraiths, drawing her bow, which is the same bow that Madoka had when she made her wish—it’s an unusual bow that looks like a tree trunk, and grows flowers of light at its head when fired. 

It was an interesting finale—kind of Gainax-y, but it managed to be more upbeat than the rest of the series, while still bittersweet, and give a lot of food for thought without seeming arbitarily confusing. 

While it was sad that Madoka’s family and her other friends completely forgot her, the part that almost made me cry was when Madoka told Homura that she remembered everything about previous timelines. Homura finally got credit for everything she went through; more than that, the love she felt was finally reciprocated. It was a moving and beautiful conclusion to Homura’s character arc and one of my very favorite scenes of the entire series, of a level with the conclusion of Fuko’s story in Clannad. And that, along with her memories of Madoka, seems to have given Homura the drive to keep going and not fall into despair. This was the “sweet” aspect of “bittersweet”, while the rest was mostly “bitter”.

The Crunchyroll commenters, bless them, are all naive little sheep. They were going on about Madoka wishing for the Incubators to die and other naive non-solutions that wouldn’t solve the root problem, sounding more like Sayaka than like Madoka. One of the central themes of the show is the conflict of the power of love and friendship with the complexity of the real world; the show does constantly make a case that love and friendship are powerful and not to be discounted, but that you can’t just naively expect them to make a big beam and blow up evil, because the world is too complicated for such a thing to be a real solution. Madoka understands this, at least intuitively. I don’t know if she could put it into words—she never did so convincingly enough to make Sayaka listen. But her actions show that she knows this. Madoka is the opposite of the energetic but ditzy heroines of other magical girl shows because she is caring, cautious, and deeply thoughtful; but like them, her major weapon is the power of love and friendship.

On the other hand, I’m a little confused as to why she chose that specific wish. It does seem like her power was such that she could have added caveats to her wish to improve the lots of magical girls, or even wish for the Incubators’ power crisis to be solved so there would be no more magical girls. Why couldn’t she have wished for magical girls’ soul gems not to become tainted? Why couldn’t she have wished for the power to come down and suck out the bad preemptively? Couldn’t she at least have wished for them to leave corpses behind so they would be remembered? It’s all somewhat confusing: what were the limitations on her wish?

Still, she did make things better; though magical girls are still destined to fight and die, they’ll die believing they’ve made the world a better place, instead of turning into witches and becoming the very thing they fought to destroy. And she just had to sacrifice her own existence and become a god. Last time, I came so close to writing that Madoka reminded me of the sacrificial hero archetype, like Frodo in The Lord of the Rings, and I didn’t, lest I be proven wrong; turns out I was somewhat right, because to save everyone with the power of love and friendship, Madoka had to erase herself from the minds of all her friends and everyone she loves. But that’s something else I don’t understand: Madoka specifically wished to do this with her own hands, so she actually specified that she would cease to exist as part of her wish. Why? Was she afraid that some other force could undo her work, and so decided to take on the power of a god to protect her new world? The Incubators don’t seem to be able to change things at such a large scale, and Kyuubei seems almost as clueless about magic as the girls are, so it doesn’t seem as if they’d be a threat to Madoka’s design. Or was this self-satisfying—Madoka’s chance to do something amazing, that she never thought she would get?

Perhaps the movie will answer some of these questions, or maybe the writers have put out answers to some of them somewhere. What’s beyond doubt is that Madoka is an amazing series, possibly a new favorite; I certainly haven’t liked anything this much since Fate/Zero, and it even edges out Fate/Zero a little because it has cute girls. (Fate/Zero had Iri and Illya and loli Rin and loli Sakura, and of course Saber, and all of them have their attractions, but they aren’t really moe like the Madoka girls, especially Homura.) Nothing since Fate/Zero has crept into my subconscious like Madoka, making me think about it when I’m doing other things, realizing things I didn’t notice while I was watching about  the events and the characters. I would even put Madoka on the level of Bakemonogatari, and that is praise I do not give lightly.

The Crunchyroll commenters all liked to talk a lot about how Madoka relates to the magical girl genre and how much they hate the standard magical girl shows and how Madoka blows them all away by being a deconstruction. I thought the same thing at first, that Madoka was to magical girls as Watchmen is to superheroes. In a lot of ways it is; it takes a genre known for certain conventions,  and for an optimistic, simple morality, and it turns those conventions on their heads, and explores a complex, subtle morality. But I don’t know if I agree anymore that it’s a deconstruction. Someone said it was a deconstruction and reconstruction, and I think that’s closer to the truth. Ultimately, unlike Watchmen, which destroyed the notion of superheroes, Madoka refines the notion of magical girls. Watchmen was a big reductio ad absurdum showing why the whole idea of superheroes was ridiculous. Madoka is actually the opposite. It accepts the genre convention that the destructiveness of negative emotions like hatred and jealousy can be overcome by the power of love and friendship. But it also acknowledges that the causes of negative emotions, and the circumstances that lead them to be destructive, are complex. Just the pure emotion of love isn’t enough to overcome negative emotions; it has to translate into action in some way. But the complexity of the problem means the solution must be smart. Giving a hug to someone who’s in pain might be a good start, but it won’t fix everything on its own. Madoka stresses the importance of listening, hearing someone out, understanding, talking, diplomacy, as tools for building a solution to the problem. Magical girls are a metaphor for the power of love and friendship; through them, these positive emotions actually become power in the real world that destroys negative emotions, reified as various kinds of monsters in shows like Sailor Moon and Pretty Cure. But in Madoka, the metaphor becomes far more subtle and complex. The monsters are the magical girls themselves; the magical girls have negative emotions, like everyone does, and only by overcoming them can they avoid causing destruction. But they can only overcome them for so long; like everyone, they sometimes fall prey to destructive negativity, and this leads them to become what they fought against. Where Watchmen simply destroyed the idea of superheroes, showing how a real world superhero would be either a flawless, godlike being that couldn’t continue to live among humans, or a flawed human himself, not super in any way, and possibly not even heroic. Superheroes are also a metaphor, but they are one which Watchmen proclaims flawed and inaccurate. Madoka instead refines the metaphor of magical girls, making it more representative of the real world, tempering the genre’s naivete and thoughtless energy with wisdom and caution. 

Another reason I’m not really on board with the Crunchyroll commenters crying “Deconstruction!” is that I suspect if Madoka had just been a regular magical girl show, except it was always night and someone got raped and everyone died, they still would have called it a deconstruction even though it would have just been a stupid attempt at being dark and gritty and edgy. Watchmen and Madoka are both dark, but they’re only as dark as they need to be to counteract the usual optimistic naivete of their genres. Neither work is pointlessly dark and gritty just for the sake of it; rather than trading naive optimism for adolescent pessimism, they trade it for adult subtlety. Watchmen is more brutal and gritty than Madoka, simply because its genre has a history of treating topics that should be brutal and gritty with naive optimism. 

Well, with that smart stuff all done, let’s end on a stupid note. I really want them to make a spinoff called “Madoka-sama ga Miteru” (she is a god, after all). In it, Junko does have a daughter, who is Madoka, although it’s not the same Madoka who became a god, but rather an alternate version. She goes to a big  expensive school and on her first day meets Homura, the rich and aloof student council president who is mysteriously attracted to her from the very beginning. As they get to know one another, their yuri love blossoms. Of course, Kyouko and Sayaka are also yuri. Mami can be like Sei in Mari Mite since she is the “oneesama”.

(I read a ridiculously adorable doujinshi called “We Went on Our Honeymoon” that takes place in an alternate reality where none of the girls has died, and also fourteen-year-old lesbian marriage is legal in Japan. Madoka and Homura get married and go on their honeymoon, as the title suggests. I first read it a while ago and I remember thinking “I kind of find this boring, but I have a feeling if I had seen this series I would love it.” That was totally true; to really appreciate how unboundedly adorable it is, you have to have seen the series and experience the power of Homura’s love for Madoka. Of course, it wasn’t yuri in the show, at least overtly [the part where Madoka and Homura are embracing while naked was kind of suggestive], but yuri best friendships are a great and honorable tradition in magical girl shows.)
** <2015-04-17 Fri>  Puella Magi Madoka Magica: The Different Story
A manga spinoff from Madoka. I can’t tell if it’s an alternate universe all the way through or just in the second and third volumes. The story follows Mami as the main character and also uses Kyouko as a major character, while Sayaka, Madoka, and Homura are secondary characters. The first volume takes place a year before the timeframe of the anime and shows how Mami became a magical girl who tries to save people, against the advice of other magical girls, and how in her loneliness, she befriended Kyouko, a new magical girl who was impressed by Mami’s thoughtful, strategic, and scholarly fighting style. (Mami takes copious notes on the witches she’s fought, the tactics she’s used, and the effectiveness of her tactics, and also studies hard to find new ways to use her magic in battle.) Kyouko asks Mami to give her lessons and become her senpai, and the two of them forge a deep relationship. However, after Kyouko’s family dies (which happens the same as in the anime), Kyouko becomes bitter and has a falling-out with Mami, despite Mami’s best efforts to preserve their partnership.

A year later, Kyouko hears that Mami has a new apprentice, Sayaka. She comes to Mitakihara to teach Sayaka a lesson, and has a run-in with Mami. Kyouko teams up with Homura, but their goals are just slightly at odds; Homura is focused on Walpurgisnacht and making sure Madoka doesn’t make a contract, while Kyouko wants to air out her complicated feelings about Mami and Sayaka. Although Sayaka isn’t nearly as stupid as in the anime, she does end up leaving Mami to hunt witches on her own, and thus the second volume still ends with her becoming a witch, and Kyuubey explaining that there was no way she could survive on her own for long when Mami, Kyouko, and Homura were already hunting witches more effectively in that area.

As amazing as the Madoka anime was, it was still more of an action/moe show than anything; the characters were well-developed, but they weren’t the primary focus. Their motives and actions drove the plot, but didn’t comprise the plot. The Different Story is much more of a character study. It takes advantage of our preexisting familiarity with the world to weave a story about Mami and Kyouko: who they are, how they got that way, and their complex relationship. Kyouko’s backstory is much more fleshed out, which makes it easier to understand her character both in this work and in the anime; we see her friendly and sweet side early on, in her relationship with Mami, and then we see how she gradually became hard and ruthless, as she was when she first appeared in the anime. But her reunion with Mami after a year is even more interesting. Anime Kyouko at first just found Sayaka an annoyance whose territory she should steal, and later began to empathize with Sayaka and tried to become friends with her. Kyouko in The Different Story still empathizes with Sayaka, but she also seems to be jealous of her. At the end of Volume 1, after Kyouko’s family dies, Mami invites her to stay at Mami’s apartment and intends to take care of her. Kyouko can’t do it, both because her views on witch hunting have changed, and because she’s lost her Fascination magic, which makes her feel she would just be a burden to Mami. Mami isn’t going to let Kyouko leave, and the two of them come to blows, but Kyouko wins because Mami has a hard time shooting her friend. When Kyouko returns a year later, it seems that she deeply regrets that she couldn’t stay with Mami, and she’s jealous of Sayaka, who has what she wants. Kyouko convinces Sayaka to leave Mami, preying on Sayaka’s shame over the fact that she knew Hitomi had a witch’s curse on her and didn’t say anything because of her dark feelings over the Kamijou incident. (In The Different Story, however, Kamijou acknowledges Sayaka’s devotion and tries to give her a gift even after he and Hitomi start going out; Madoka tries to intercede on Sayaka’s behalf and tell Kamijou how Sayaka feels, but Sayaka refuses to capitalize on the opening Madoka made for her.) This leads to Sayaka’s death; once again, Mami tracks down her apprentice and begs her to stay, and once again the apprentice refuses, feeling that Mami’s morals are too high for her after what she’s done. (I.e. leaving Hitomi to be eaten by a witch, although Mami found the witch with Madoka’s help and killed it.) Mami, who always does her best to hide her imperfections from her “kouhai”, tries at the end to reveal herself to Sayaka a little, hoping that Sayaka will realize that Mami can forgive her for that, but it isn’t enough, and Sayaka continues her path to destruction.

I only bought Volumes 1 and 2, but I’m going to get Volume 3 soon, because the story has been amazing so far. In Volume 1 I kept thinking “Where does Mami get off being so cool when she’s just Mami? She’s almost as cool as Homura-chan!” Especially the very last panel of the volume, when she faces down Kyouko again after a year, her face set firmly, her flintlock pistol leveled. Mami looks unreasonably awesome in that panel. She definitely had her cool moments in the anime, but her personality made her less cool than she might have been since the anime focused more on her loneliness and her joy at having Madoka and Sayaka with her. While The Different Story uses this as a major element of Mami’s character, it spins it more into Mami as an awesome lone wolf hero whose combat prowess and moral strength contribute to her loneliness, by making her seem greater than human to others. Kyouko is also amazingly cool and adorable, especially how she conveys the pain she feels over her lost relationship with Mami in her facial expressions, her lies to Madoka and Sayaka about how Mami is just using them, and her constant sour grapes. I hope that Homura and Madoka can play a bit more of a role in the next volume, since they were my favorites in the anime, but I applaud The Different Story for taking the two least fleshed out characters of the anime and making them incredible.

** <2015-04-19 Sun> The Movie: Rebellion
I wrote about about the finale of the TV show, “It was an interesting finale—kind of Gainax-y, but it managed to be more upbeat than the rest of the series, while still bittersweet, and give a lot of food for thought without seeming arbitarily confusing.” The movie, unfortunately, is absolutely Gainax-y and every bit arbitrarily confusing. It is, in fact, a terrible movie: alternately boring, character-breaking, and ridiculous; shoving in new characters and events without bothering to even try and explain them; and clearly concerned about nothing except for showing off its giant animation budget. It’s scary how similar to End of Eva it is, especially with the impossible-to-understand final scene.

The movie starts with yet another alternate reality where all five main girls—Madoka, Sayaka, Mami, Kyouko, and Homura—are best friends who form the magical girl team Magica Quintet and fight against the Nightmares. While there’s some combat involved, defeating a Nightmare is mostly a matter of feeding it sweets and singing. In one strange early sequence, the girls sing some kind of cake song and destroy the Nightmare created from Hitomi’s anxiety at her and Kamijou’s schedules never matching up so they can go on a date. 

With Kyouko’s help, Homura discovers that the city is fake, and surmises it to be inside a witch’s labyrinth. She still has the same memories, both of the original timelines with witches and also of the timeline with wraiths that came about after Madoka became Godoka. Homura blames the only person she doesn’t remember: Bebe, a strange creature that looks like the witch that killed Mami in the original timeline, but is now Mami’s closest friend and lives with her. Bebe turns into a little girl, but before Homura can manhandle her too much, Mami arrives and they have an awesome but pointlessly long midair gun fight, which ends with Homura winning by almost shooting herself in the head, making Mami attempt to save her and opening Mami for attack. 

After defeating Mami, Homura is confronted by Sayaka, who also remembers the original world. Sayaka asks if this world is really so bad, and Homura seems repulsed by the idea. Somehow Kyuubei talks (it previously pretended to be unable to talk) and when Homura realizes that she’s the witch, it explains to her that she’s inside a field where Godoka can’t reach her. The Incubators created a plan to seal Homura and keep her perpetually on the edge of witchdom. Only those that Homura admits can be inside her labyrinth; the idea was that Godoka would come inside, since Homura would allow it, and they could trap her so that witches would once again exist and they could harvest the energy. However, Godoka was one step ahead of them; she erased her own memories of being a god and gave them to Sayaka and Bebe, aka Nagisa Momoe (this name is never in the movie but it’s in doujinshi so I assume it was revealed somewhere). Madoka breaks the barrier and frees Homura, but at the last minute, as she descends to take Homura away with her, Homura rebels, takes Godoka captive, and creates a new world. She explains to Kyuubei that her soul gem wasn’t stained with despair, but rather with love. She decides to create a new world based on her own selfish desires; as she does, she grabs Kyuubei, saying it has an important role to play in the new world as the carrier of curses. 

On the walkway to school, Sayaka confronts Homura about what she’s done, and Homura essentially says she’s decided to become evil, and since she opposed the will of a god you could call her a devil. Sayaka asks if she’s ever going to end this world, and Homura says perhaps when every single wraith is dead. Even as they speak, Sayaka loses her memories of the other world where the Law of Cycles (aka Godoka) ruled. Homura sits in class while the teacher introduces a transfer student, Kaname Madoka, who Homura befriends in an almost exact inversion of the first scene of the anime when the Madoka who became Godoka first met Homura. Homura asks Madoka if she thinks it’s okay to break the rules, and Madoka says it might be, sometimes, but she doesn’t think it’s okay to break them just because you feel like it; she then seems to start to remember and regain her godlike powers, only stopping when Homura seizes her into an embrace.

After the credits, we see Homura in a field with her soul gem, which now looks like a chess piece. Kyuubei is also there, looking all scruffy and beat up. Homura jumps off a hill, and the movie ends.

So, basically, I hated it. It was terrible. One of the things I liked so much about the TV series was that although it was complex, the characters’ actions where always believable in context, and it was pretty much always clear what was going on; the TV series never resorted to cheap gimmicks, psychobabble, or info dumps. The movie is nothing but cheap gimmicks, psychobabble, and info dumps. It doesn’t build on the characters’ pasts in any believable way except for bits and pieces of pieces and bits. It completely short-changed everyone except for Homura, but then didn’t even do anything interesting with Homura. It never even explained anything about Bebe/Nagisa, like what her name was or why Godoka chose her to be the second retainer to enter the labyrinth with her and Sayaka. 

The most irritating thing about this movie is that, like End of Eva, since it makes no goddamn sense at all, you can basically make up your own movie, and then it can be interesting if you make it up to be interesting. I don’t say “interpret it your own way” because I’ve been thinking about how to interpret this movie since yesterday, even reading other people’s interpretations to try and gain some insight, and no matter how I look at it, every interpretation is unsupported by the evidence in some vital way. But since it’s not really a movie, rather a “make your own movie” kit, I’ll play along and make up my own movie, like I did with End of Eva. 

Essentially, this is what I think happened: Homura went bonkers. She’s crazy. Blew a fuse. Got a screw loose. A few eggs short of a dozen. She says herself in one scene that she started to think she might be crazy and have imagined Madoka, since no one else remembered Madoka. The girl’s been mortally injured dozens of times, killed her own best friend and other friends dozens of times, witnessed Mami shoot Kyouko in the head that one time (which seems very out of character after reading The Different Story), had to become a killing machine, had to be the bearer of so many terrible secrets. We have no idea how long Homura was actually in that time loop during the series; it could well have been hundreds of years. Then at the very moment Madoka acknowledged her sacrifices, she lost Madoka and had to live in a world where no one knew Madoka existed. It wouldn’t be surprising at all if she just went freaking crazy, lost her nut, flipped out, went mad. Plus, we can see that her personality is somewhat obsessive, and she spent a lot of time ill and alone prior to the series; I bet she was already vulnerable to mental illness just on the basis of her personality. The exact moment she went crazy, I would say, is the moment when Kyuubei told her about how they trapped her in the field and had her make a labyrinth. It was building up the whole time, but that was the moment she snapped.

The Homura who was earlier disgusted when Sayaka said the false world wasn’t so bad was still able to think rationally. Homura the Lunatic reversed positions and decided that she didn’t care if the world was fake, or what Madoka wanted, as long as she and Madoka could be together. So, when Godoka came to take Homura away, Homura did something insane and captured Godoka, probably using the Incubator’s field in some way, and erased Godoka’s memory. To be precise, I think Homura split Madoka. The imagery suggests this might be the case. She split the personification of the concept of the Law of Cycles, Kaname Madoka, from the concept itself. The Law of Cycles continues to exist, which is why Homura’s world contains wraiths instead of witches. However, as we’ll see below, this leaves what happens to Kyuubei unexplained. If we instead assume that Homura didn’t split Kaname Madoka from the Law of Cycles, and instead just trapped the entire godlike being in the physical world, there is an explanation for what happens to Kyuubei.

In any case, Homura embodies Sayaka and Madoka and possibly also Nagisa in her world, suppressing their memories of godhood. (I guess Sayaka and Nagisa were sort of like angels since they were Godoka’s assistants.) Mami and Kyouko also still exist here. (Kyouko earlier declared her lesbian love for Sayaka, so both lesbian couples are in fact canonical.) Homura then recreates her meeting with Madoka, with new memories. But I guess she was tired of being the transfer student. After all, she was the transfer student for like fifty cycles, let Madoka do it for once. Or maybe she couldn’t set up the world like it was because Madoka would remember too easily. So she recreates their meeting, but she seems to try and make their relationship move too fast, and it triggers Madoka’s memories to return. Homura knows she can’t allow that since the very morals that made Madoka give up her own existence to begin with would make her reject this love nest of a world. She hugs Madoka, and the power of her love that let her create this world asserts itself again, and Madoka’s memories are suppressed. 

In essence, Homura became a creepy stalker who confines the object of her obessive affections and makes that person accept her love. Although Madoka is adorable and a good person and definitely a fitting subject for love, Homura’s obsessive personality and all the external things she had riding on her success with saving Madoka during the series caused her to develop an obsessive fixation on Madoka, that she calls love. During the series, and a few earlier scenes in the movie, we definitely see genuine affection. Homura loves Madoka as a person. But now that she’s a lunatic, her love takes a lunatic turn as well. She becomes almost like Kathy Bates in /Misery/. I don’t think she would ever actually hurt Madoka, but she seems willing to do just about anything else, including ignoring Madoka’s own desires so she can have what she wants. 

Now, if we assume the Law of Cycles still exists, then I have no explanation for the scene with Kyuubei. But if we assume it doesn’t, then Homura’s words about what she’s going to do with Kyuubei suggest something. If there is no Law of Cycles, witches should still exist. But apparently, they don’t, because Homura mentions the wraiths. I think Homura, as the devil, has a similar power as Godoka to purify the soul gems of magical girls. But she doesn’t just purify them, break them, and take the magical girl’s soul to live with her in yuri heaven. Rather, Homura stores the suffering in her own soul gem. She then transfers it all to Kyuubei. Kyuubei now, ironically, has emotions; it experiences all the suffering and pain its actions have heaped on magical girls over the centuries. Homura is the devil of a hell where the only tortured soul is Kyuubei. Homura did this because she saw that as long as the Incubators were able to act freely, they could still cause trouble, as when they tried to trap Godoka. This way, the Incubators are under Homura’s power.

I plan to watch the movie again to find more evidence for my theory. One of the web sites I read expressed some concern over backlash, since Homura is a popular character, but I guess, like Homura herself, my love is somewhat obessive. When I choose a best girl, she very nearly has to rape and murder for teh lulz to make me change my mind, and there are even some cases where a girl who did that would just make me like her more. Case in point: no matter how nasty Yozora Mikazuki in Haganai got, she was still my favorite. Another case in point: Tsukihi-chan was like Joe Pesci in Goodfellas and beat the holy hell out of some boys who were merely jerks, but that just amused me. It’s the same here with Homura; I think it’s interesting if she lost her mind and kidnapped Madoka. Makes me like her even more. Makes those doujinshi about her obsessive love for Madoka more plausible, even though she’s always a goofball in those, and she’s definitely not one here. 

Even though the movie managed to draw me into the “make your own ending” kit fun, it was still terrible. I don’t mind a little ambiguity, but this is just a mess. It’s just lazy. I read that Urobuchi intended to end the series with Homura going to yuri heaven with Madoka, but the producers wanted to leave the possibility of yet another sequel open, so he came up with this ending. Unfortunately, it now pretty much requires another sequel to be even semi-intelligible, but we’re probably not getting one; or else we’ll have to wait twenty years like with the new Eva movies.
