* Extending and Embedding Moe <2014-11-22 Sat>
When I was about fourteen, I wrote an essay titled “Why the Disney Channel is the Devil”, about how the shows on The Disney Channel for tween girls were the devil and anime was the best.  Today, I’m going to write an essay which could be called “Why The Disney Channel is a-okay with me”, in which I admit the embarrassing fact that I’ve been watching some of those tween girl shows and that a lot of them are actually kind of moe. It’s entirely possible that in ten years, I’ll be writing another essay entitled “Why The Disney Channel and Anime both Suck and Jean-Paul Sartre is the Best: A Homo-Anarcho Collectivist Media Manifesto”, about how Jean-Paul Sartre is the best, except that if he’d written about homo-anarcho collectivism, he’d be even better. 

The reasons for my change of heart essentially boil down to this: due to various circumstances, I had to watch some of the modern day incarnations of those Disney Channel shows (and also their Nickelodeon equivalents) that I used to hate, and actually, I kind of liked them and they had moe. They had moe because I’m a moe freak and I interpret everything as moe. This can be summed up by the saying “iCarly has an oniichan”, which was the first thought that occurred to me upon watching this show. Ipso facto, the character Carly from iCarly is living with her dorky older brother who dropped out of law school to be an artist. She and her older brother are very close, sometimes creepily so, and her brother goes to extreme lengths to help her out of various bizarre situations, including dressing up as an old woman to try and get back her web site’s domain name after it’s stolen by an evil villain. Clearly, he deserves to be called by the name “Oniichan”, just like Kyousuke Kousaka, Koyomi Araragi, or Touya Kinomoto.  

Or to take another example: the premise of the show is that an airheaded teenager with improbably developed physical prowess gets out of a scrape by lucking into a job as a live-in servant for a rich family, taking care of their bratty kids, after a string of similar servants have been forced to leave. Is it Hayate the Combat Butler, or is it /Jessie/? Actually, it’s both. 

Of course, just that wouldn’t have been enough to get me. The writing would have to be at least sort of clever, and the dialogue and humor tasteful, for me to have this change of heart. And they are. Not every joke works for me, and not every story works for me. /Girl Meets World/ is probably the most confusing example. I never watched /Boy Meets World/. It seems like its stars both did pretty well as child stars go, since they’re both capable of appearing on a children’s show without causing a PR nightmare. (Just think about what would happen if Lindsay Lohan or Miley Cyrus tried to come back to Disney at this point, after all the skanky lesbian stripper pole dancing and drug use.) The basic premise is that the two stars from the original show have a daughter in middle school, and the father, the main hero of the original show, is her history/social studies teacher. Her best friend Maya is kind of a delinquent whose father isn’t around and whose mother is an overworked waitress with dreams of stardom. Every week there’s a new lesson to be learned. To be blunt, it should be intolerable, and the stories often conclude in a way that makes very little sense, and the dialogue will sometimes get forced and strange. As an example, there was an episode where Riley, the main girl, discovers that the nerds at school consider her one of them, and while at first she is horrified, she decides to go with it and dress up as a Harajuku girl in a crazy outfit. She enters the spelling bee to keep up with her nerd image, but Maya sabotages her by revealing that she can’t even spell the word “Harajuku” and forcing her to admit she wasn’t being herself. Does that make any sense? No. Even a little? Not really. But the two lead girls are so cute and adorkable, and their relationships are so sweet and fun, that I still somehow like it, even though I ought not to.

Most of the other shows have better writing, although they’re not as cute. Of course, it’s not all good. Sometimes the writers rely on bathroom humor too much, and I hate laugh tracks; if a joke needs a laugh track to tell you it’s funny, it’s not really funny. But most of these shows stand up without the Pavlovian dog psychology; I once watched an episode of /Sam and Cat/ (now sadly canceled, so the girl who plays Cat can go prance around naked in a rapper’s mansion on video) with the sound screwed up, so the laugh track was muted. There was a strange pause after every line of dialogue, but otherwise, it pretty much held up.

/Liv and Maddie/ even made an episode about a character in a situation somewhat similar to mine, where the main heroines’ younger brother watches a show that is to /Liv and Maddie/ as /Copper, Silver, Gold: An Indestructble Metallic Alloy/ is to /Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid/ and gets embarrassed when his friends find out, only to discover that they too watch it.

Well, now the beer’s effect is starting to lighten, so I don’t think I can write about this topic anymore. This is a confession, one I am going to encrypt and hide. It’s not an encryption scheme that would hold a professional cryptographer for long, but then, no lives are at stake here, just my reputation.
