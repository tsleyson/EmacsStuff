Chocolate Insomnia! By Nora.
============================
I love chocolate. Next to books, it's probably my favorite thing.

Lots of kids my age like chocolate, but most of them don't like it as much as I do. A few years ago, my mom's boss at work gave her a box of expensive chocolate as a Christmas present. I don't know if her boss made a mistake, was trying to play a joke, or thought my mom would like it, but that box had some of the weirdest chocolate in the world in it. There was chocolate filled with bacon in it. There was chocolate filled with chunks of some kind of fruit I'd never heard of in it, some kind of sweet white berry from the jungle. There was chocolate with wasabi in it. That's a kind of spicy green paste that Japanese people eat. And there was chocolate with curry powder in it.

My sister ate some of the chocolate from that box and made a big show of gagging and spitting it out in the garbage. Even my dad tried it and couldn't handle it. My mom ate some of them, the ones that were more normal like the one with the strange fruit and another one with slices of lemon peel in it. She didn't want the rest, so she gave it to me. She warned me that if I didn't like it, I could throw it away. But I did like it. I ate every chocolate in that box, even the weird ones. The wasabi wasn't anywhere near as bad as I'd thought it would be, and the curry powder one was actually kind of good. Some of them, I didn't like very much, but some of those chocolates were so good that every time I bite into one of the regular chocolate bars from the grocery store, I remember them and wish I was eating one of those instead. I really liked one that had a spice called fennel in it. Fennel tastes sort of like black licorice. I'd never liked black licorice that much, but when you paired the flavor with chocolate, it was delicious.

After I found out how much I love chocolate, I used to save a little bit from my allowance every week and ride a bus with my sister to the mall in the next town. There was a shop there that sold nice chocolatesâ€”some weird ones, like the ones in that box, but also normal ones like almond, cherry, vanilla, and coffee. You could look at them all inside a glass case, and ask the woman behind the counter to take out the ones you wanted and box them up for you. I'd buy a box of chocolates, and every Friday evening, I'd sit in my room with a new book, eating chocolate and reading. Even though I love chocolate, I'm not so good with caffeine, so I would usually be up reading until midnight or so.

After I came to St. Galgani's, I couldn't really do that anymore. At nine o' clock, Mrs. Lovett, the dorm supervisor, comes around and makes sure everyone is in bed with the lights out. Besides, there was nowhere to buy good chocolate around here. The high school has a bakery where you can buy cookies and cakes, and there's a convenience store that carries the usual candy bars. I tried staying up and reading with the usual candy bars, but they made me sick the next day, so I didn't try that again. Cora says you used to be able to get ice cream bars from the kitchen, but now you can only get carrot sticks and celery.

I must have complained about that to my sister at some point, because when I came back from the clubroom one Friday afternoon, I found that Mrs. Lovett had left a package from my parents inside my door. There were three things inside: my old quilt, a letter from my parents, and a nice box of chocolate from the store back home.

I opened the letter first, addressed in my father's firm, solid handwriting. *Dear Nora,* it began.

I opened the box of chocolates. There was a little card inside, also in my father's handwriting, that said which kinds were in the box. I chose a cumin chocolate and bit into it. After so long, that dark and smoky-sweet flavor spreading in my mouth made me almost want to cry. It tasted like my father, somehow.

I went back to his letter.

<div class="block" style="margin-left: 3em; margin-right: 3em; font-style: italic;">
*Dear Nora,*

*I hope this letter finds you well. I was very interested to read your thoughts on Matthew Arnold's work in your last letter. If you don't mind, I may present them to my students the next time I teach English literature. Your teacher, Miss Hanover, seems to be encouraging your mind to develop well. I understand the libraries at St. Galgani's Academy are very extensive, and am glad to hear that you're taking advantage of them.*

*Your mother and I are concerned about you, however. Your letters to your sister suggest you're having a hard time adjusting. It sounds as though the other students don't quite understand you. From the sound of things, you've tried very hard to fit in and I was glad to hear it. Even though your mother and I know you are a unique and very intelligent girl, that's no excuse to look down on others, and it seems you know that. I'm proud of you, but also worried that you aren't happy.*

*Enclosed is a box of chocolate and your quilt. I hope you can find at least a little happiness with them. If you ever feel that you don't want to be at St. Galgani's anymore, call us. We'll be there to bring you home within a day or so.*

*Love,*

*Your father*

The last time I'd written home, I was complaining to my sister about having no friends. I hadn't written home yet to tell everyone about Lily or the fun I was having here now. My dad had gotten the wrong idea and thought I was having a hard time.

I picked up the letter, and the box of chocolate, now half-gone, and brought them to my desk. I had to write back and tell my father that it was all right now and I didn't need to come home. I took out a pen and paper and began to write.

My parents would worry if I told them about the camping trip, though, so I left that out. I also didn't think they would be very happy if they heard about the time when a swarm of bees chased us and we hid in the pool. They would worry if they knew about the dog that Cora had brought out of the alleyway behind the kitchen, so I left that out too. And I didn't think they would believe me if I told them about Angelica.

But I did tell them about how I met Lily. I told them about Ranta, and Cora too. I told them about the puzzle contest, and the book fair, and about how Lily had rescued me from the Fiorentino family. My final version went like this:

<div class="block" style="margin-left: 3em; margin-right: 3em; font-style: italic;">
Dear Dad,

Thanks for your letter, and thanks a lot for the chocolate and quilt. I don't think you should tell your students what I said about Matthew Arnold. They probably wouldn't like it since it's from a kid, and it might make you look bad. I don't want that.

Things have gotten a lot better here since I wrote last time. I finally made a friend! Her name is Lily. She's a grade above me, and she has the Gift of Gardening. I met her in a garden full of plant species that she bred herself. I also made friends with Ranta, a girl in the same grade as me. She has the Gift of Running, but even though she likes sports, she also likes reading. We're all in a club that Lily made, along with Cora. She's a cat girl who I help with her studying sometimes.

I have a lot of fun every day. Lily, Ranta, and I got to go on a camping trip with the Geology Club to help watch the younger kids. We also entered a puzzle contest, and I found out that I'm actually pretty good at puzzles. Ranta and I went to a book fair, and we met her brother. He's in high school, and you're not going to believe this, but he can teleport. But he bugs Ranta the same way Linda bugs me.

I still don't get along with everybody. Some girls from my class took me hostage a little while ago and made me watch videos of the folk sing-along that one of the teachers here used to do. But Lily rescued me, and Cora made sure they wouldn't come after me again, and I didn't have to do the mile run, so it wasn't that bad. So you don't have to worry about me. I still don't know what my Gift is, but I want to find out, so I'd like to stay here for now.

Love,

Nora

As I put the finishing touches on my letter, I noticed that at some point I had stopped moving my left arm and started tapping my right foot. The box of chocolate was empty. As I was writing, I'd been reaching over and grabbing chocolates mindlessly. Now they were all gone, and I'd barely even gotten to enjoy them.

Chocolate doesn't affect me like coffee does, but I was probably still going to have a hard time getting to sleep. I decided to take a shower and then read until lights out. That might relax me enough so I could get some sleep.

The dormitory has a nice, huge bathhouse down in the basement, with one side reserved for the girls and the other side for the boys. Dark, steamy, dimly lit by the glow of orange lamps, and tiled in scarlet, it reminds me of an ancient Roman bathhouse. Once, I almost bathed in there. After two weeks, I'd finally talked myself into going to the basement. I'd gone into the girls' changing room, a long hall with a rough wooden floor, where you could check out a locker and leave your clothes. At the end, a big archway led into the baths. I had walked to the end, fully clothed, my towel in my hand, while the other girls stared. I had looked left and seen the cart loaded down with bottles of shampoo and soap and body wash. I had looked right and seen another cart loaded with plastic tubs you could take to put your shampoo and soap and your locker key in to carry into the baths with you. The steam billowing out of the baths had made me lightheaded and hot. Then I turned around and saw the other girls undressing and standing around, casually chatting while naked. I had blushed and lost my nerve, leaving that place forever.

I couldn't just get naked in front of a bunch of other girls. It was too embarrassing. Ever since that day, I had only bathed in my room.

I took a shower in the little stall in my room's bathroom. After my shower, I put on clean pajamas and sat down at my desk to read a little. I was reading a book of H.P. Lovecraft stories that I'd found at the high school library. Miss Hanover had told me they were pretty scary, but I wasn't afraid of ghosts or monsters, so she let me give it a try. Lovecraft had an interesting way of using words, and some of his ideas were pretty imaginative, so I liked his work so far, even though it wasn't the kind of thing I usually read. My dad told me the worst thing you can do to yourself is read the same kinds of books all the time. If you don't try something new every once in a while, you won't grow. 

I read until I heard Mrs. Lovett's sharp, irate knock on my door. It was nine, so I had to turn my lights off and go to sleep. I hit the switch and climbed into bed, knowing I wouldn't be able to.

My eyes snapped open two seconds after I closed them. The blur cleared, and the ceiling appeared above me, covered in inky blue darkness. I could see every bump on it. I rolled over on my side and closed my eyes again. Two seconds later, they were open again. This time I could see the extra bed across the room. My stuffed animals, dragon and tiger, turtle and phoenix, were staring across my quilt at the door.

*Maybe I'll sleep better with my quilt,* I thought. At home I'd always had that quilt on my bed. It was perfect in summer, when the weather was too hot for a regular blanket. In winter I stacked it on top of another blanket to stay warm.

I got the quilt and arranged it on top of my blanket, then tried to go to sleep. This time I kept my eyes closed for about five minutes. But it wasn't really cold enough for two blankets. I pulled off the other blanket and tried just the quilt.

I was almost asleep when the thought came to my head, *I'm almost asleep.* Then I was wide awake again, and my eyes snapped open.

I glanced at the clock. It was 10:30. I couldn't believe I'd already spent an hour and half trying to go to sleep. There was no way this was going to work. I would never get to sleep just tossing and turning in the dark. I decided to get up and read some more. If I used the big overhead light to read, Mrs. Lovett would notice and make me turn it off, but if I used the small desk lamp, maybe she wouldn't see it.

I turned on the desk lamp and started reading again. I was just starting to get absorbed when I heard a rap on my door.

"Lights out!" Mrs. Lovett yelled. With a sigh, I turned off my desk lamp and got back into bed.

My aunt had gotten me a booklight for reading in bed one Christmas, but I didn't use it at home. I had a bedside lamp, and no one minded if I stayed up a little late to read. I hadn't even thought that I might need it at school. But I knew after tossing and turning for another ten minutes that a booklight was exactly what I needed now.

I decided to try a different tactic. If Mrs. Lovett could see the light from my lamp under the door, she would yell at me. But if I covered the light with something, she wouldn't be able to see it. If I brought the desk lamp under the quilt and read, she wouldn't see the light, and I could read until I was tired.

I got out of bed and got my book and the lamp. The lamp was a little dusty, so I wiped it off before I dragged it under the covers with me. I laid down on my stomach and set the lamp on its stand. It held up the quilt for me, so I could just open my book underneath it and read. It was a little dusty, and a little hot, but I could finally read in peace. As my eyes moved over the pages, I felt them finally want to close.
