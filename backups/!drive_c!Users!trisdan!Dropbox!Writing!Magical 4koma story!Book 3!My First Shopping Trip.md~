My First Shopping Trip. By Nora.
================================
When you're a student, you never think that much about what teachers are like outside of school. When I was in kindergarten, I used to wonder if teachers lived at school. I knew it was wrong even back then. But somewhere in the back of my mind, I had this idea that after all the kids left, the teachers would go into the back room and plug in to their charging units until it was time for class the next morning, kind of like those robotic vacuum cleaners. It didn't sink in that teachers were regular people with houses and families until I met the teacher's assistant from my kindergarten class at the grocery store. It was summertime, and I was out shopping with my parents, and we saw her handing out free samples of ravioli at a table at the end of the frozen food aisle.

At my old school, it was different with the other kids. You went over to their houses sometimes and met their parents and their brothers and sisters and dogs and cats, and played with their toys, and saw where they slept, and ate dinner with them. But at St. Galgani's, most of us lived at school. Only the teachers went home at night. So you didn't think that much about what the other kids were like at home. Even your friends never had you over to play; you never ate dinner with them, or saw their rooms. So you didn't think that much about what they were like at home, because they did live at school most of the year.

On a beautiful Saturday morning, when the breeze blowing through the campus was just a little bit frosty, Lily invited me, Cora, and Ranta to the garden for a tea party. Because of Cora's cold, Lily had had the idea to start making herbal teas for colds. She'd invited us to taste them, along with the last of the summer fruits.

We were sitting around the white wicker table in Lily's secret corner of the garden, eating melon slices and sugar cookies that I'd brought from the high school bakery. Lily had her self-heating tea kettle at the center of the table, and three teapots, each with a different blend of herbs. Since it was a tea party and not garden work, I'd put on a skirt and tights instead of jeans. Ranta had also worn slacks and a nice blouse, and even Cora had put on a skirt. But after we'd gathered around the table, Lily came stomping up in her boots and overalls, the same as always.

"This one's rose hips and lemongrass," said Lily, pouring us each a cupful from one of the pots. "It's a little sour, so try it with the honey."

I spooned some honey into my cup and stirred it, leaving the spoon on the saucer before I sipped.

"It's a little too sour for me, even with the honey," Ranta admitted.

"But sour things taste good when you have a cold," I said.

"Try this one next," said Lily. "I made this for you, Cora."

"For me?" Cora simpered. She only simpered to Lily. She growled or snarled to everyone else.

"It's an energy-boosting blend. I made it from peppy mint and assertion astragalus. Now that you're over your cold, it should help strengthen you up." Lily poured us each a cup. The astringent astragalus and the spicy peppy mint balanced each other perfectly, especially with a spoonful of honey added.

I felt like standing up. It was probably the tea. I got out of the chair and finished my cup standing, with the saucer in one hand and the cup in the other.

"This is some strong stuff," said Cora, also standing. "It kind of makes me feel like playing tag or something." She put down her cup and noticed that I was standing too. "Tag! You're it!" she cried, jumping at me and shoving me in the chest all of a sudden.

I stumbled backwards and skidded off my feet, falling into a bush. Two spots on my chest, one for each of Cora's palms, were throbbing.

Cora winced. "Sorry," she grumbled, her face twisted into a grimace, as if apologizing to me pained her. "I didn't mean to hit you that hard."

"It's okay, I just wasn't ready," I said.

"No self-control, as usual," Ranta sniffed.

"Are you all right?" Lily asked, coming around to the bush and offering me her hand.

"Yeah, I'm all right." I took Lily's hand, and she helped me up. But as I lifted myself from the bush, I felt my tights snag on something. Before I could stop moving, I heard a *rip*. I finished getting to my feet, then pulled up my skirt to look. A thorn had caught my tights and made a long tear in them, about seven inches long.

"Oh no!" I exclaimed. "This was my last good pair of tights!" I couldn't sew at all, so I had no hope of repairing them. Mrs. Lovett, the dorm monitor, was supposed to help us with things like that, but no one ever asked her. Asking Mrs. Lovett for anything was a good way to end up cleaning the bathrooms for a week.

"It is amazing how many clothes disappear in the wash," said Ranta. "I think Cora steals them to make a nest."

"I do not!" said Cora. "I think you steal them to hold for ransom!"

"I have an idea," said Ranta. "Nora, you've never been to town, right?"

"No," I said. 

"Why don't we go to town tomorrow and buy some clothes? There's a clothing store at the mall. We can get lunch there, too."

"Is that okay?" I asked. "Do we need to ask someone?"

"Usually, you need to get permission from a teacher, and you need a grown-up to go with you. But we're sixth graders, so I think they'll let us go if Lily is with us. I'll go to the office later and ask a teacher," said Ranta.

"If Lily's going, so am I!" said Cora.

Lily circled around the table to her third teapot. "This one is licorice root and mallow. It's good for sore throats," she said, pouring us each a cup.

The next morning, Lily didn't show up for breakfast.

She usually does show up, but sometimes she goes to work in the garden early and doesn't get here
