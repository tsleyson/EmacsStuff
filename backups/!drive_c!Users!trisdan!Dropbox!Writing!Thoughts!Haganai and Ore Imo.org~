* Haganai and Ore Imo: The Last Word. <2014-02-28 Fri>

It's not quite the last word because Haganai isn't over yet, but Ore Imo is, and I wanted to talk about this. 

First, let's get one thing out of the way: Haganai is a complete ripoff of Ore Imo and Haruhi. Basically everything about the concept and setup came from one of those two shows. Essentially, it's a show about a somewhat more refined and calm Haruhi and a richer and more pathetic Kirino clashing, while a younger and even more delusional Kuroneko, a blonde version of Toradora's Ryuuji Takasu, and a trap and a nun and a mad scientist look on.

But the vital thing we have to remember is those qualifications, where I had to explain what wasn't the same. Because Haganai, it's true, stole most of its concept and setup. But what it did with those things was rather different, and in execution, it shows off the originality that it doesn't have so much in its conception.

For one thing, Haganai made the smart decisions to make Yozora look nothing like Haruhi (unlike, say, PapaKiki's Sora or Angel Beats's Yuri) and to give Sena more of a rich girl personality and round off a lot of the tsundere aspects of Kirino so she would start out more sympathetic. Unlike Kuroneko, who actually is smart and talented and knows how to use lots of big words, Kobato is just pretending to be smart and talented and she frequently flubs her big words and lets her real self show through, both by acting immature and by slipping into her Kyushu accent. And Yukimura, Rika, and Maria have no real analogues in Ore Imo or Haruhi; Rika is sort of like Sena Akagi, but is much more fleshed out as a character, and unlike Sena Akagi, she's totally shameless about being a fujoshi and isn't hiding anything.

The reason I wanted to get that out of the way is that I need to say something which, it must be clear, I say in the full knowledge that Haganai stole many of its founding ideas from Ore Imo. I think Haganai is the better show.

I've watched Ore Imo 1 and 2. I've watched Haganai 1 and 2. Ore Imo 1 was better than Haganai 1. In my original thoughts, after seeing through Episode 9, I decided that Haganai was the equal of Ore Imo, but mostly because of Ore Imo's faults. I later decided I was wrong and Haganai wasn't quite Ore Imo's equal. 

Haganai 2 was better than Ore Imo 2. It's not even a contest. Haganai 2 was one of the most hilarious anime I've ever seen. I don't think I've laughed that much at a show since Excel Saga. (I was in the UC Davis library, too, so it was hard to stifle my laughter.) It was so good that I could watch two episodes of it, then watch three episodes of Railgun or something else, and my enjoyment of Haganai 2 would increase my enjoyment of Railgun (or whatever). And not only was Haganai 2 funny, it also had interesting character development. In Ore Imo 2, the characters did the opposite of develop. They degraded. 

As the most striking example, let's take Rika, a character I compared with Scrappy Doo at the end of the first Haganai series. By the end of the second series, she was my second-favorite in the whole group. I didn't even have to think too hard about whether to put Kobato in that spot; it was really no contest. 

By contrast, several characters became drastically less interesting in Ore Imo 2. Ayase, for one, never really developed into her storyline about falling in love with Kyousuke. We could see from pretty early on that she had a thing for him, but then she started hating him. Then she loved him, and there was no smooth curve to it at all; it was just a sudden revelation thrown into the last two episodes. Kanako was rehabilitated, but I still didn't like her, I just was able to stomach her. That's because her rehabilitation was abrupt, apparently unmotivated, and didn't make any damn sense, and it depended in part on our godlike knowledge of the existence of her sister Kanata, Saori's otaku mentor . And I never liked Manami much, but what they did with her in the final episode—though it worked fine at a conceptual level, making her really not a very nice person—was so poorly handled that it felt like the writers were just lazy and needed something to end the series, since the final scene was just a return to the state of things at the beginning of Series 2 (making the whole of Series 2 entirely unnecessary). 

I don't want this to become yet more criticism of Ore Imo 2, but that really is what made me realize that Haganai is the better show. It's very nearly an episode to episode comparison between the two shows, too, because they follow almost identical arcs: they begin with the main hero meeting two girls, at least one of whom he has a prior relationship with which is now strained for some reason. The hero starts hanging out with the girls, learning about them, doing things with them, and getting to know them. The girls both fall in love with the hero as the first series progresses; he gets some kind of show of this from each of them by the end of the first series (plus OVAs). In the middle, we have amusing adventures with the minor characters, some of whom are also less serious contenders for the hero's love.

In the second series, things heat up, relationships deepen, and the rivalry between the two heroines heats up, especially because they also are starting to like each other better. The blonde wins in the end.

So here's a fleshed out, apples to apples comparison. In the first Haganai series, not a lot happens. We meet everyone and we get some (fun, but strictly unnecessary) filler episodes that build up the relationship between Kodaka, Yozora, and Sena, as well as some episodes that focus on the minor characters. Then we end the first series with Kodaka visiting Sena's house, and then the revalation that Yozora is his childhood friend, Sora. While none of this material was bad, none of it advanced the characters much beyond the state of things when they first appeared. Sena seemed to have a thing for Kodaka as early as Episode 3, and nothing much changed.

In the first Ore Imo series, quite a bit happens, but most of it happens in the first five episodes, which were filler in Haganai. (Up through the end of the Ayase story; I'd say Episode 2 is the equivalent of Haganai's Episode 4, though, even though Kuroneko is introduced and she's the second heroine.) Nothing really happens after the first five episodes, until Episode 11, the big Kirino climax. Both versions of Episode 12 are pretty much structural scaffolding for what's coming. Then we get the OVAs, in which Kuroneko makes it clear that she likes Kyousuke, up to the Kuroneko finale at the end of the OVAs.

In the first Haganai series, there's some fun content but not a lot of character development. It's mostly subtle and not very significant stuff. When we learn that Yozora is Kodaka's childhood friend, we do learn something about Yozora (namely, that's she's even weirder than we thought, and that she's been weird ever since she was a child), but it doesn't really advance the story. The first Ore Imo series feels a lot more different when you compare its beginning and its end; we go from Kirino barely being able to stand Kyousuke and kicking him in the balls for trying to help her (in Episode 5) to putting on a maid outfit for him, giving him a present, and sincerely thanking him for all his help. 

But Ore Imo has already laid all of its cards on the table by Ore Imo 2. We already know how everyone feels about everyone else by now. So we get several episodes of stupid filler before moving into the Kuroneko romance subplot. The tenor of the series is totally different in these episodes, more sweet romance than the otaku comedy it's been so far, but I still liked them, and if the show had just ended after Episode 9, I would've just said "The first few episodes were lame, but it got pretty good at the end. It wasn't bad, and I liked seeing what happened to all those characters. It might've been nice to see what happened to Ayase, but that's okay, I'm satisfied with what we got." Unfortunately, it went on past Episode 9 and did probably the worst ending since Mahoromatic's space bounty hunter finale, although in a way it wasn't even that good because it wasn't a spectacular failure like that. Mahoromatic's ending was a 747 crash; Ore Imo's ending was more like a car whose wheel camber isn't adjusted correctly, and at first you don't really notice, but it starts to get more apparent the further you go and finally the wheel flies off. 

Haganai, by contrast, still had some development to go through in its second series; it didn't even really get into a proper romance subplot. But it also didn't utterly waste the rest of its time on crud like Ore Imo 2's Episode 10 (where Kirino is in a wedding dress and Kyousuke is in a tux and she stares at him longingly for half an hour as he takes her to a concert on a bicycle with a naked loli on the tires) or Episode 2 (where Kyousuke reaches new heights of creepiness and insanity), or even the less terrible but still not good Episodes 3 and 4. Instead of jump-the-shark events and random info dump backstories for the minor characters, Haganai 2 gave us interesting stories like when Rika did her best for the culture festival, or when Kobato turned out to be well-liked after all, or when Maria and Kate came over and we saw how their home life is and how they interact when they're not fighting. The only character who got any kind of interesting development in Ore Imo 2 was Kuroneko; we did find out more about Kirino, and all of it was cute, but it almost felt more like material from the non-canonical Ore Imo all-ages visual novel. By contrast, the development that Kuroneko went through was believable, well-developed, and followed smoothly from what we'd seen of her in previous episodes. But we got that for every character in Haganai 2. 

It was pretty surprising for me to realize that I felt this way, because I had always thought Haganai was sort of a guilty pleasure series. It did rip off a lot of stuff (as I said) and it can get crude sometimes, although it usually does so with good comedic backing and as tastefully as possible (not many writers could have made a story about the two main heroines riding the roller coaster too much and vomiting a lot and still have them be cute). But that was in the first series. Haganai 2 totally ramped it up. Ore Imo 2 totally screwed it up. If they had done something else with the last three episodes, it still could've ended on a good note and I might never have thought of writing this. But the last three episodes just completed the downward trend. 

If the two series are released on DVD, I will certainly buy Haganai 2, and love it. I might buy Ore Imo 2, just because I have Ore Imo 1 and was a pretty big Ore Imo fan for a while, and still feel grateful to it for rekindling my passion for anime and teaching me about moe and little sisters. And maybe if they come out with Ore Imo 3 and Haganai 3, the dial will swing back again. (Since Ore Imo 2 ended with everything in the same state it was at the end of Series 1, they could just do Ore Imo 3 and have it be like Ore Imo 2: Second Edition, but take place after Ore Imo 2, but just have Kyousuke hook up with Kuroneko once and for all.) But for now Haganai is better.
