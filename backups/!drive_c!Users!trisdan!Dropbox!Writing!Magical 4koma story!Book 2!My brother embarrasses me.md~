My Brother Embarrasses Me. By Ranta.
====================================
I wasn't happy at all when I found out that Lily knew my brother. I usually try to make sure my friends don't know about him. But since Lily knew him already, it was only a matter of time before Nora met him too. Worst of all, if Nora and Lily had both met him, that probably would mean Cora would meet him. Then I would have to die. I couldn't go on living if Cora knew my brother.

My brother, Aurelio Julio Octavio Mahal de los Reyes III. Just look at his name—no one with a name like that could possibly be normal. When we were young, my parents used to get me dolls for Christmas and my birthday. Rel was more into the dolls than I was. I would play with them for a while, then get bored, and they would end up in the toybox in the playroom. Then Rel would take them, and he'd dress them up and put them in poses and comb their hair, and he'd spend his allowance buying new clothes and accessories for them. He used to watch the daytime talk shows and soap operas, and he'd act them out with his dolls—the woman who came to the TV psychiatrist because her husband loved the dog more than her; the soap opera plot where the man's evil twin brother tied him up and married his fiancée in his place; all of them were reenacted in our playroom by Rel, using the dolls that were supposed to be mine. 

When I first started at St. Galgani's, I sometimes went over to his room to see him when I got lonely. We were both in the elementary school then, so I just had to go to another wing of the dormitory. After he moved up to middle school, I went over there a few times to see him too. But ever since he'd gone into high school last year, I had stopped going to see him. I didn't want anyone—even the teachers—to know we were related. And for that reason, I also hardly ever went over to the high school's little shopping center.

But that afternoon, as I was going over to the clubroom, I saw a poster hanging on the fence around one of the planter boxes. The picture showed a pair of theater masks, the happy and sad masks surrounded by a ribbon, above an opened book, the pages fluttering in the wind. Amatus Books, one of the bookstores in the town, was holding a book fair in the high school shopping center, today and tomorrow from noon to five. I'd been looking for something new to read, and Nora was always looking for new books—that girl seemed to eat through books the way a sheep eats grass.

I went upstairs to the clubroom and found Lily, Cora, and Nora. Lily was watering her plants, as always; Nora was reading, as always; and Cora was sitting around scowling, polishing her glasses, and staring off into space, as always. When she saw me come in, Lily put down her watering can and went to get tea for me.  "Two creams, a drop of honey, right?" she asked.

"We spend too much time in here drinking tea, for you to remember that," I said with a laugh, but I gratefully accepted the cup of black tea she set out for me, sitting down at the table across from Nora. I glanced at Nora's book. *Horror High: Totes Terrified!*, it was called. I was surprised to see her reading something like that. I had never read any of those books, so I didn't really know what they were like, but from what I'd heard, they weren't Nora's usual fare.

After I'd finished my tea, I announced, "Sorry to run out so fast, but the bookstore from town is having a book fair over at the high school, and I thought I'd go check it out. Does anyone want to come?"

"Oh, I do!" said Nora immediately, shutting *Horror High: Totes Terrible!* and putting it in her bag. "Lily, is it all right if I leave my bag here?"

"Of course," said Lily.

"Me too?" I asked, and Lily nodded.

"I'll pass," Cora growled in her usual rude way. "The last thing I need in my day is more frogging books."

"I wasn't really inviting you anyway. I know someone who can't read has no use for books," I said, and Cora snarled at me. "Lily, what about you?"

"No, but you two have fun," said Lily. "If you see Rel, tell him hello from me."

Now that she said that, I almost didn't want to go. I was really hoping I wouldn't see Rel. But now that I'd invited Nora, it was too late to back out. "I will," I said. "See you later."

"Bye," said Nora.

We left the clubroom
