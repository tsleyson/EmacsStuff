* Thoughts on  B Gata H Kei, begun 2014-01-08 in First Impressions File
I bought this because it was only like $12, similar to Asobi ni Iku yo. It’s more like what I was looking for when I bought Asobi ni Iku yo: an ecchi comedy.

B Gata H Kei is about Yamada, a horny virgin who enters high school with the goal of having sex with 100 guys for some reason, but finds that she freaks out in the presence of good-looking guys and decides to start with Takashi Kosuda, a plain and unassuming guy who ends up sitting next to her. Yamada sets out trying to seduce him so she can have sex with him and then throw him away and move on to the next, much hotter guy. Kosuda, for his part, knows Yamada is a freak due to her early attempts to seduce him, but he keeps hanging out with her anyway, I guess because she’s hot and ought to be out of his league, and he can’t believe the luck.

It’s kind of like School Rumble, but not as funny and a lot dirtier. One of the things that makes it funny is that Yamada is really not a good person at all. She’s arrogant about her beauty, inconsiderate of others’ feelings, and whiny. Also, she’s so horny that it’s damaging her brain somehow. She reminds me of that Dalí painting “Young Virgin Auto-Sodomized on the Horns of her Own Chastity” with the girl who’s made of dicks. A vibrator could do her wonders. 

But the show so far has done a good job of not letting Yamada win too much. Her best friend, Miharu Takeshita, knows that she’s not a good person. (Takeshita suffers most of her whining.) Takeshita’s boyfriend, Daisuke Matsuo, also guesses pretty much right away on meeting her that she’s not a good person. (When Yamada asks Takeshita what his impression of her was, Takeshita remembers him saying “She seems like a difficult person to be friends with, so good luck.”) Yamada’s little sister, Chika, also seems to think her sister is a fruitcake. The only people who don’t realize what a terrible person Yamada is are Kosuda (who dimly knows) and his childhood friend Mayu Miyano, who has a crush on him. When Yamada goes to destroy Mayu, her romantic rival, Mayu is so nice that she inadvertently tricks Yamada into becoming her romantic advisor instead.

The animation is just okay; while the character designs are good looking, there can be some oddities in the art. But the sound side is very good: the background music is eclectic and interesting, featuring so far (among others) a Spaghetti western action theme and a jazz piece. The voice cast is full of stars; Yamada is voiced by Yukari Tamura, Takeshita is voiced by Yui Horie, and Mayu is voiced by KANA HANAZAWA as another soft-spoken glasses girl (though this time with big breasts, in contrast to poor flat-chested Aoi in Asobi ni Iku yo). But none of these stars are playing a usual type; Yui Horie, as usual, defies having a type, and although Kana Hanazawa has played soft-spoken glasses girls before, she plays each one a little differently and does such a good job at it that it feels fresh anyway.

As long as the show doesn’t let Yamada win too easily, it ought to be pretty good.

I’m kinda bored with B Gata H Kei. In part, it’s because I don’t really like Yamada or Kosuda; Yamada is just hard to like, because she’s superficial, manipulative, and arrogant (in a superficial, manipulative way). Kosuda is just sort of a lump of flesh who gets swept along on Yamada’s ride.

That could have been funny, but it’s not really handled all that well. Pretty much every episode starts with some event going on, and Yamada thinking how she needs to take this opportunity to seduce Kosuda, and Kosuda thinking he should invite Yamada to partake of the event with him. Yamada always acts like she’s not interested, but in the end she and Kosuda do something together. It just gets boring. At the beginning, when Yamada was acting like she had brain damage from horniness, it was at least amusing, but that’s not even really going on anymore.

The show introduced a rival for Yamada, Kyoka Kanejo, a rich girl who competes with Yamada to be the “queen” of the school. But although we later see that Kanejo was purposely competing with Yamada too, it all just starts with Yamada being a mean bitch whose bitchiness is limited only by her total incompetence. And although Kanejo thinks that she wants to be the “queen”, she goes out of her way to act sweet and friendly to everyone except Yamada (including her servants), so my alternate character interpretation for Kanejo is that she’s actually a reasonably nice, if somewhat entitled, person, who happened to hate Yamada because she could tell that Yamada is a terrible person. Also, Kanejo is in love with her oniichan, which automatically makes her more sympathetic than Yamada to me.

Now the show is starting to hint that Yamada is actually in love with Kosuda, which was just barely hinted at before, although it’s not a surprise, so it’s more like just bad writing.

I kind of wish Miharu and her boyfriend Daisuke had been a bigger presence in the show; compared to Yamada and her annoying, self-aggrandizing relationship with a mindless lump of meat, it’s nice to see a relationship where the participants are good people who obviously love each other and even have enough trust to say bad things about each others’ friends. It would also be nice to have more of Mayu, although to be really interesting she would have to stop pining after that mindless lump of meat.

Part of my problem with this show is just that Yamada and Kosuda are too much like real high school students, and I don’t want real high school students, I want anime characters. If anime characters weren’t all high school students, I would still like them, but when they become like real high school students, it becomes uninteresting to me. But it’s also boring. There’s no real character development and the jokes aren’t even that funny—at its best, the humor is kind of like really low-grade Excel Saga or really low-grade Haganai. By the way, the case of Haganai is instructive, because Yozora and Sena were both abrasive and ultimately not very good people—they both did much worse things than Yamada—but somehow, they were still likable, and the secret is character development. Yozora and Sena were both intricate and highly developed. Yamada is just an unsympathetic comedy protagonist in a show that isn’t really that funny.
