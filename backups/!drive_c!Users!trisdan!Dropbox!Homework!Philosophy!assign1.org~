* 1. Why are research results published in a refereed journal respected?
From Oreskes (69): "Papers published in scientific journals must pass the scrutiny of critical, expert colleagues. They must be supported by sufficient evidence to convince others who know the subject well." So results published in refereed journals have been reviewed by other scientists who are experts in the area the paper discusses, who would likely have rejected any papers containing suspect results.

* 2. How can both of the following sentences be true?

    (a) The number of climate scientists who actively do research in the field but disagree with the consensus position is evidently very small.

    (b) There are a significant number of contrarians who disagree with the consensus position.

Most of the contrarians are not climate scientists who actively do research in the field (Oreskes 74-75). Oreskes points out that two prominent contrarians, retired solid-state physicist Frederick Seitz and novelist Michael Crichton, "along with most other contrarians, do no new scientific research" (75). 

* 3. How should the claim “No scientific conclusion can ever be proven” be understood?
Unlike a result in mathematics, which can be definitively proven within a suitable formal system, scientific hypotheses about the natural world cannot be proven, since the great breadth of the natural world always admits alternative explanations. Any scientific conclusion can potentially be overturned, but some are much better supported than others by available evidence.

* 4. How are the following claims different?

    (a) The theory is falsified.

    (b) The theory can be falsified.

* 5. What does “consilience of evidence” mean?
