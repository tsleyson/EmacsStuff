* Book 3 Plot Ideas

Book 3, I would like to have three or four shortish stories. Like The
Boredom of Haruhi Suzumiya. Here's my ideas for them:

**Lady of the Morning

James investigates an older man who, the neighborhood gossip says,
has been sleeping with a much younger woman, despite the fact that
he's married.

James spies on them one morning and sees that the rumors are true and
that the woman is drop-dead gorgeous. (A Latina beauty). She goes into the house and gets to work servicing the old man with her hands and mouth, surprising James with the vitality of the old man's response.  He follows
her and uses his laser listening device (whatever those things are
called) to hear her ask to go to Sacramento as she gets into a cab.
James surmises that she has money and lives far away, so he can't
figure out why she's with the old manâ€”it's not money, and it's not convenience.

James looks her up on the Internet and finds out that she's a
masseuse named Sayona Suarez (after La Sayona, a Venezuelan mythological creature). She seems squeaky clean for the most part, but he stumbles on a shady forum where women are discussing a masseuse in Sacramento named La Sayona who helped them get rid of their cheating husbands. (He finds it by searching for masseuses in Sacramento who double as prostitutes for extramarital affairs.) James formulates the theory that she's a succubus who hires herself out to wounded wives to kill their cheating husbands.

James runs this theory by Sophia, who agrees that it sounds plausible and asks what he's planning to do about it. She adds that she's sorry, but what Sayona's doing isn't against the rules, so she can't help. James says he's just going to leave it alone since it would be in bad taste to report it, but Sophia doesn't believe him.

She's right not to believe him, of course. James spies on them again, taking video this time (which is sent back to his computer), and confronts Sayona as she leaves the house. Sayona tries to seduce him and kill him, but it doesn't work (since he's immune to succubus pheromones). James says he knows she's a succubus and asks if she'll talk to him. His real goal is that, although Sophia promised to tell him a few things about herself and make sure to give him vital information in the last book, he still wants to know the things she won't tell him about the succubus world, and he hopes Sayona will tell him. Sayona says she was hired by the old man's wife to show him a good time, then kill him, she doesn't know why. She assumes the old man was cheating, since most of her clients are wives who were cheated on by their husbands and want revenge, or want rid of an ex-husband.

James lets Sayona go since he can't fight her (even though she's not as powerful as Sophia since she's only been a succubus for a mere ninety years, but he doesn't know that) and goes and confronts the wife. The wife says she wasn't trying to murder her husband and he wasn't cheating on her. Since she has no one to confide in, she talks to James and tells him that she loves her husband, but the man is dying. He won't go to the doctor, so they don't know what he's dying from (he says he doesn't want to know), but he's dying of something. He said he wanted to feel young again and then have a painless death, so the wife found Sayona on the Internet and asked if she would give him a few days (weeks, months) of pleasure, and then the release of death. She agreed to do it, and soon she's going to finish him off.

James finishes the story by telling Sophia that he agreed not to tell anyone about the whole thing and Sayona offed the old man, with no one the wiser. Sophia says she's happy to hear that a succubus's power was able to go to good use.

[Alternately: Sophia as the lady of the morning? She could just be asked to hang out with him, and not actually have sex or kill him, but in the end he talks about wanting to have sex one more time before he goes and Sophia decides to give both things to him. James spies on her and finds out from her what's going on.]

**Sister Therapy [title check]

About how James and Lucy "dated" for a while like in the last few episodes of Ore Imo (I actually thought of the idea in this context way early in Episode 14, when Kyousuke was dumping poor Kuroneko.) It was Lucy's idea since she had a crush on him when she was 12, 13, and 14 and he was 16, 17, 18. He agreed just do to it for a little while to make her feel good, but he's not really into it and thinks it's kind of creepy how she doesn't seem to have any friends and spends all her time on dates with her brother. 

He went through the murder investigation he talks about in Book II Chapter 8. He actually tracked down the murderer and was almost murdered himself; he tried to turn the guy in, but the attacker resisted and ended up shooting himself right in front of James. Throughout this event, James relies on Lucy and starts to see how brilliant, strong, and fun she is; he starts to find her advice invaluable (he flails around a lot here, more like Stark than Sherlock, and Lucy keeps him on the right track) and to find their dates a sort of mental oasis from the terror he goes through as he tangles with a serial killer.

In the end, after the attacker shoots himself, Lucy comforts James by reminding him that even if the attacker evaded justice, his victim is alive and he's dead, and that's the most important thing. Except that, she adds, James himself is also alive, even though he could have died; she bashfully admits that that's the part that's most important to her.

When he was 18 he was planning to force Lucy to break it off since an eighteen-year-old and a fourteen-year-old are weird anyway, let alone when they're blood siblings. After this event James realizes he's actually developing feelings for her since she's so cute and fun and smart, and he knows that's the worst, so he forces her to break up. Lucy was heartbroken and asked why, since they're so good together and people even say they're a cute couple; James tells her it's because they're siblings and it's creepy and disgusting. Lucy is very hurt by his way of saying this and decides to go far away for high school to give herself time to heal. But James keeps joking around with her like he does and she hates it because he keeps tempting her and also it's like he's mocking her younger self.

James tells all this to Sophia when she asks how he developed such a weird relationship with Lucy. Sophia doesn't really believe it. In recompense, though, James gets to hear a story from her past, and so the next short story is one of those. (Written from Sophia's point of view.)
