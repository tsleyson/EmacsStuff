I had been auditing the course Linguistics 103A from the beginning of the quarter with permission of the instructor, Laurel Lawyer, a graduate student in the Linguistics department. When I discovered I would require one more unit of upper-division coursework to complete my degree, I officially registered in the course.

I was registered less than a week. I received no grades and took no time from the instructor or the TA that could have gone to other students. I received no services at all associated with the payment of fees, other than attending the lectures, which I did with full permission of the instructor, taking no resources from registered students. I was, in fact, very careful to ensure that I never took resources from registered students during my time as an auditor. She has agreed to write a letter for me, attesting to this, which I have attached.

I have made good-faith efforts to pay the fees, as shown in the attached student account summary from SISWeb, but as I have been a full-time student and unemployed for the past two years, my savings is coming to an end and I cannot pay any more. Because of this, and the short duration of my registration, during which I consumed no campus resources associated with the payment of fees, I ask that the remaining amount be pardoned.

I have attached a letter from Laurel Lawyer, the instructor of the class in which I was registered, in support of my claim. I have also attached an account summary showing that I have made efforts to pay the money. I hope that it will be found appropriate to grant my petition.
