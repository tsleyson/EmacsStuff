* Thoughts on AI ga Tomaranai <2014-03-31 Mon>
Out of sheer boredom, I've been reading illegal scans of AI ga Tomaranai, Ken Akamatsu's first manga series, which came before Love Hina and before Negima.

The series is mostly of historical interest. It's interesting to see how what Akamatsu was doing towards the end of AI informed what he did in Love Hina, in the same way that what he was doing at the end of Love Hina led naturally into Negima. AI's main character is Hitoshi Kobe, a loseriffic computer whiz, who, in an act of sheer fantasy, creates a full-fledged AI program on his mid-90s computer. Akamatsu knew computers, so he probably knew this was basically impossible; after digesting the idea that a loser high school kid wrote a real AI (one actually quite a bit more human than Star Trek's Data) on a computer with 32 megabytes of RAM, it's not too hard to accept that a lightning strike brings her to life (yeah, of course she's his dream girlfriend). Since her program name was Program Number Thirty, she decides that her human name is Nambaa Saati, which looks oddly Finnish (all those double a's). 

So yeah. The series is basically Weird Science: The Anime. In the same way that Kelly LeBrock in Weird Science had magical powers for some reason, Saati has magical powers; but this was written around the time that Ah! My Goddess was popular, so Saati's powers are basically a ripoff of Belldandy's (and Saati herself is also basically a ripoff of Belldandy). For a while, Hitoshi is your average good-natured mid-90s harem hero, but he starts to get perverted towards the middle, and is punished for it, similar to Keitaro (except it's not accidental at all). Saati's sister Program Number Twenty, known as Toni, comes along and is exactly like Urd (except people considered Urd attractive in-universe, whereas Toni always comes on too strong and gets rejected by guys, including Hitoshi, who hid her disk away until Saati found it and thought how nice it would be to have a big sister). Later, Hitoshi designs a younger sibling for them, Program Number Forty. Toni wants Forty to be a wild, grubby, little boy, while Saati wants Forty to be a prim and proper little sister. While fighting over the computer, they end up creating a hermaphrodite who can change his/her appearance (but not genitalia) between the male Forty-kun, who has Saati's traits of being serious, clean, and kind, and the female Forty-chan, who has Toni's traits of being wild, fun-loving, and destructive. Forty-chan is basically Kaolla Su, as Akamatsu himself says, which at least makes her not a ripoff of Skuld. 

Sometimes the series can be fun, but it never reaches Love Hina's level in either jokes or serious content. Probably my favorite story so far was the creation of Forty. I actually prefer Forty-kun to Forty-chan, since we already had Toni as a wild character. Plus, there's no one like him in the other Akamatsu series (which also tended to play well with me in Negima). When Forty-kun first appears, he spends two days terrorizing everyone and forcing them to clean the whole apartment (which somehow keeps expanding to fit in new AIs as they're created); everyone thinks he's an awful tyrant, but then Saati sees him use his powers to return a baby bird to its nest and remembers that she entered 'kind' as one of the personality parameters. Forty-chan is just like Kaolla Su, except not as good, because Su's schemes and devices were so bizarre and nonsensical that it made her really fun to watch, whereas Forty-chan comes off like an amateur's attempt to rip off Kaolla Su (which I guess she is, since Akamatsu wasn't as experienced at this point). 

I don't mind Saati, although she's kind of boring. Belldandy's unrelenting sweetness made her a pleasure to watch even when she wasn't doing anything intersting, but Saati doesn't have that. She becomes just a bit like Naru (who she somewhat resembles) towards the middle, although nothing like the way Naru and Asuna are twin sisters for the first four volumes of Negima. 

I don't really like Hitoshi or Toni, though. Hitoshi is somewhat like Keitaro, but he's a lot more vain (he created an AI to be his perfect girlfriend, after all) and doesn't have Keitaro's admirable qualities, like being a hard worker or having a sense of honor. When Keitaro got into Hinata-sou because of Haruka's mistake, he kept flagellating himself for lying and trying to make himself feel better about what he was doing. Throughout the series, when he does something wrong, he does whatever he can to make it up. Hitoshi seems to have no problem lying, cheating, and stealing, and he's lazy; even though he was smart enough to make an AI on a mid-90s PC using just C, he's failing all his classes, and later tries to hack into the school computer and change his grades. He even has the nerve to complain that he's failing all his classes in the first volume, when that's completely his own fault. Hitoshi doesn't really deserve Saati, and it almost seems like Saati knows it, but she stays with him because she doesn't want to admit it. (I know that's not what Akamatsu intended, but that's what it looks like to me when I read some of these stories.) Plus, there was just something about Keitaro that made you feel for him; maybe it was how hardworking he was, or his persistent self-doubt, or the enormity of his goals, or the fact that he was romantically trying to get into Tokyo University to see a girl he hadn't seen since childhood. Hitoshi is basically a worthless lazy ass who has a hot girlfriend that he doesn't deserve, who serves him food and raises his status at school and only ever expects the tiniest amount of gratitude in return, which she doesn't get, as often as not.

Toni is basically Kitsune, but again, she doesn't have any of Kitsune's redeeming qualities. Yes, Kitsune was a useless drunkard who meddled and irritated everyone, but at least she was a loyal friend to Keitaro and Naru, and even tried to help Motoko and Shinobu by encouraging them to make their feelings for Keitaro known. Plus, her schemes were a lot funnier than Toni's. A lot of the time the actions Kitsune suggested didn't make any sense at all, but she would persuade people to follow her through sheer persistence. Toni just uses the old standards to try and make Saati and Hitoshi have sex. Also, she doesn't seem to have any sisterly feelings for Saati, and usually thinks of her as a nuisance. That could've made me like her more, if she at least cared about Saati a little. (Or Forty, who she usually regards as just a useful pawn in her schemes.) 

Anyway, the series isn't that good, but I'm bored and it's not the worst thing around. If every chapter was like the one I just read where Toni invents a pair of underwear that whacks Hitoshi in the nuts every time he thinks about sex, it would be one of the worst things around, but happily, most of them are moderately better than that.

** On the rest of AI, <2014-04-13 Sun>
The ending wasn't bad. By the end you could totally see the series turning into Love Hina; most of it was ludicrous contests for Hitoshi's love and the girls getting stripped over and over.

A new character named Cynthia "Cindy" MacDougall shows up, and she's definitely proto-Naru. She and Saati battle over Hitoshi's love, which culminates with Saati trying to delete herself and return to the machine (and Toni and Forty trying to go with her) and Hitoshi declaring his undying love for her.

I liked Cindy, though. She was a lot more fun than anyone else. She had a lot of Naru's cute traits, like always trying to seem strong and then having to admit that she's hopeless. I also liked when we find out that even though she's a celebrity, she's hardworking.

Cindy gets the whole of Volume 7, and the whole of Volume 8 pretty much goes to Hitoshi's little sister, Yayoi. It turns out that Yayoi is a computer genius who's at MIT along with their father. When they were younger, Hitoshi gave Yayoi a complex about her small breasts, so now she compulsively grabs other women's breasts. (That makes about as much sense as the usual Ken Akamatsu reason for grabbing breasts.) When she discovers that Hitoshi's figured out how to use the "reality module" (aka magical box) to make AIs come to life, which has been their father's life's work, she tries to bring their father's Program Number 0 to life, but she accidentally cross-breeds it with a virus. It disables Toni and Forty and Saati must go defeat it. After that, all three AIs and Hitoshi go to America with Yayoi to be part of Hitoshi and Yayoi's father's research.

I liked Yayoi too. Hitoshi doesn't deserve a little sister as cute as her, nor does he deserve Cindy. Fortunately, Ken Akamatsu has slowly gotten better at writing main characters; by the time we get to Negima, we can actually see why all these girls like him so much. And it was at least plausible that the girls of Love Hina would fall in love with Keitaro after how long they were together. I kind of wish he would have included a reincarnation of Yayoi in Negima. The closest was Paio Zi, the boob-obsessed mercenary who's actually a little girl with dragon horns in a big suit. Kanako sort of was too, but she didn't have any of Yayoi's personality traits left.
