Showdown in the Courtyard! By Cora.
===================================
It was the middle of October, and school had been in session for two and a half months. The weather had been hot, but not too bad most days. But it was starting to cool off, and we all knew that autumn was beginning, and winter was close behind, tailgating autumn like the crotchety old geezer it was.

How was that? I tried to do one of Nora's dorky poetic openings.

I was sitting in the lounge after class with my friends. I call them that, but really, I'm not sure how we ended up hanging out all the time, and I wouldn't give a flake of dander for some of them. Those two idiots Greta and Sweta, for example. Tubby little lard buckets, like a couple of pigs in blonde wigs. They had their eyes glued to some soap opera right now, rotting out what little brain cells they had. I was pretty sure it had been their dumb idea to hold Nora hostage to try and make Ranta throw the mile run a little while ago. Not only had their idea totally failed, it had also made Lily mad at me. After that time when we were alone in the clubroom and Lily walked out on me, I'd thought about it, and realized she probably acted the way she did because she was mad at me about that.

Leah, Willow, Gracie, and Mikaela were also there. We were all sitting on couches and armchairs around a coffee table, while Greta and Sweta sat on a large ottoman outside the circle, their dumb mouths lolling open as they took in the horror of what Marsha had done to John when she was under alien mind control. Leah and Willow were looking at a fashion magazine, and Gracie and Mikaela were talking about the soccer team's last practice. Mikaela was on the soccer team, and she was trying to convince Gracie to join. She'd tried to get me too, but I'd turned her down.
