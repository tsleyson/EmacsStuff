Looks like we're all set, thanks for coming in today

No problem, thanks for having me here

How are you doing today?

I'm great, I just got back from my honeymoon in Disneyland

And how was that?

It was very nice. The weather was beautiful. Much better than the
frigid temperatures we're experiencing here.

I know, isn't it awful? 

I miss the days when I lived in California, and I could go tanning
in my backyard in the middle of January

Wow, that sounds like a dream. That said, let's get started. My name
is Patrick, and I work for a research firm called Focus Forward. 

OK.

Today, we'll discuss your grocery shopping habits. Now, you should
know that I don't work for a particular company that endorses a specific
food product, so you shouldn't be afraid that you're hurting my feelings
with anything that you say. What we are looking for is your honest,
open opinion.

OK.

So why don't you start off with just telling me where you typically
grocery shop: where, when, and how often.

I go to various places in my locale. Costco, ACME, Super Fresh, and
even Whole Foods, which I know is expensive, but they have a lot of
special products you can't find elsewhere. 

What do you mean by \textquotedbl{}special\textquotedbl{}?

Gluten-free products in particular. I have celiac disease, so I have
to stay away from gluten as much as possible, despite how much I love
eating pizza. 

Celiac disease. Can you tell me more about that?

Like I said, I have celiac disease, so I cannot eat wheat or most
other grains. I usually have to stick with rice flour or corn flour.
But I don't really like those, so I often avoid most grain substitutes
altogether. I do like quinoa sometimes; it's a good replacement for
oats. 

I never tried this quinoa; I might have to try that sometime. 

Yeah, you should, it's not bad. 

So let's talk more about produce. Do you regularly shop for produce?
If you do, do you stick to fresh, or frozen?

Well, to be honest, I hate produce. I mean, who wants to eat a bunch
of rabbit food 

{[}LAUGHTER{]}

Interesting. Well, I'm grateful for your honesty. 

Oh no, I was being sarcastic. I do buy produce all the time. Every
few days, if I'm at the grocery store, 'cause it just doesn't keep.
Frozen, I guess is more economical, but it just isn't the same. 

What do you mean by \textquotedbl{}just isn't the same\textquotedbl{}?

Just\textemdash{}doesn't taste as good.

Doesn't taste as good, right. 

And yeah, it's just, sometimes I'll microwave frozen broccoli or whatever,
and it comes out kind of rubbery or overcooked. Just dead.

Right, I think I understand.

Yeah.

So let's move on to baked goods and bakery sections in grocery stores.
What is your experience with those?

Oh, they're the devil.

Why is that?

Again, the gluten, gotta stay away.

Oh, right, right.

My mom loves dessert, especially when it comes to baked goods. 

Oh really?

Yeah, all she eats is sugar, sugar, sugar, and she's a diabetic, but
she loves her dessert.

Is diabetes something that you worry about when making food choices?

Not particularly, although it does concern me, as my mom regularly
has to take prescriptions for drugs like Humalog. And I think the
other ones she takes is Lantus. I don't want to have to worry about
taking drugs like that if I can avoid. But I know with my mom, she's
supposed to watch the sugar, but she still eats a lot of those bad
foods anyway. 

What would you consider bad food?

Well, for her she just has to--

Right, right. So how about the meat section in a grocery store? What
do you usually look for there? Are you vegetarian or vegan? 

No way; I like my steak! But yeah, I don't usually buy steak that
often, 'cause it's very pricey.

So what kinds of meat do you usually buy, then?

Chicken, turkey, and buffalo, which they say is better for you than
beef.

Who's \textquotedbl{}they\textquotedbl{}?

Just things things I've read. My nutritionist told me this once too. 

So you go to a nutritionist.

Not so much anymore, but I did for a while. 

What made you stop? Did your interest in foods change?

No, more so I just realized that it was up to me to take responsibility
for what I ate. Not for someone else to do so. But I started going
in the first place because of the problems I was having with the glutinous
foods I was eating. 

Glutinous?

Yeah, the gluten. 

Oh, right, the gluten.

All the wheat, the bread, the cakes, the pizzas, all the good stuff.

So, would you consider yourself health-conscious when it comes to
selecting food that you eat and groceries that you buy?

Well, I definitely like to elude the idea that I'm a health nut by
any means. Certainly, I mean I have to avoid popular foods like bread
and whatnot, because it makes me sick if I eat them. 

What about health-conscious, though? Do you consider that the same
as a health nut?

No, not at all. I guess I would say I'm health-conscious; I'm definitely
conscious of the foods. I have to avoid to stay healthy, so that would
make me health-conscious.

Then I'd like to take a step back now and allude to some of the things
you mentioned earlier in regards to produce. You mentioned that you
prefer fresh over frozen, right?

Correct.

What about canned? 

Not so much into canned produce, though sometimes every now and then
I'll buy some canned fruit.

And in terms of fresh, do you prefer the bagged lettuce or bunches
of lettuce?

I definitely say the bag is more convenient, but I've been trying
to buy more local produce, which is easier to find as bunches or heads
of lettuce, rather than the more convenient bagged lettuce.

What is the general principle you would follow, then, when choosing
between buying the more convenient bags of lettuce versus buying the
local produce?

I'd have to say that--well, that's actually hard to say. I find the
bunches of lettuce often complement the bagged lettuce, because sometimes
you can't get all the different lettuces you want in the bagged lettuce,
but if I had to choose, I guess I'd say bagged. It's not only more
convenient, but usually cheaper.

Makes sense. Let's move on, then, from healthy produce to what some
would call junk food. What do you usually pick up, if anything, when
heading down the snack aisle?

Usually I buy potato chips or tortilla chips.

Do you have any rules or principles you try to adhere to when purchasing
more guilty foods like those?

I try to make it a habit only to buy one or the other, and only one
bad snack food like that, when on a grocery trip.

Wow, impressive. Is there a particular brand of chips that you're
loyal to?

Not particularly. I do like Tostitos, though, and Lays.

Interesting. So when you go grocery shopping, you only allow yourself
to buy one of the two, either tortilla chips or potato chips. 

Yup.

Why is that?

Foremost, I'm concerned about my health. And lately I've been reading
a lot in the news about the carcinogen chemical acrylamide, that's
produced when high-carbohydrate foods are heated for long periods
of time.

Acrylamide. Interesting. So this is a concern for you, one that motivates
you not to indulge too much. 

Yes, definitely, I'd say.

Makes sense. Good to know. Well, we are wrapping up now, but I do
have to compliment you. You have been very helpful today.

Thank you, I appreciate it. This has actually been a very stressful
experience for me. It got me away from some of the exhausting things
I do as a principal.

Oh, you are a principal.

Yes, at a high school about thirty minutes away from here.

Do you enjoy that?

Yes, very much so, despite the stress. Though I have to say all this
talk about food definitely makes me want to go to the grocery store,
to buy lunch for tomorrow. I'd definitely like to avoid having to
eat at the school cafeteria tomorrow.

I can only imagine. I definitely don't miss the days of cafeteria
food.

That's the one bad thing about working in a high school.

For sure. Well, again, I definitely want to thank you for your time
and for coming in today.

No problem, I enjoyed this, actually.

Great, well, it's been a pleasure.

You have a good rest of your day.
