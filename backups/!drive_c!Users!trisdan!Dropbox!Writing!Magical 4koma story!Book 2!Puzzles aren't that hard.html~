<h1 id="puzzles-arent-that-hard.-by-lily.">Puzzles aren’t that hard. By Lily.</h1>
<p>How are you? I’m Lily.</p>
<p>Even though I’ve never talked to you before, I’m not here today to tell you about myself. I’m pretty boring, to be honest. I have the Gift of Gardening. If you’ve ever thought about which superpower you’d choose if you could have any you like, you probably didn’t choose gardening.</p>
<p>Today I’m going to tell you about something that happened to my friend Nora. She wouldn’t tell you herself because she didn’t want to sound like she was bragging. But even if she did brag a little, I think that would be all right, because Nora has a gift that’s a lot more amazing than my gardening. But she got embarrassed when I told her, and said she didn’t like to boast or brag, and wouldn’t talk about it anymore. Even though she’s really smart—I might even say she’s a genius—she’s so modest. She’s the opposite of someone like Cora, who has a little talent and a big mouth. That’s why I love her. Well, one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Nora and I had known each other for about three weeks when this happened. She’d been helping me in the garden, and had joined my club, the Helping Hands. We’d helped Ms. Rutherford clean the PE shed together; we’d gotten rid of a dog for the student council; and we’d gone on a camping trip with the Geology club. Nothing much had happened since the camping trip, and we’d spent most of our days drinking tea in the clubroom while Cora and Ranta fought over various things.</p>
<p>Nora didn’t know I had spent most of the nights of the past three weeks sleeping in a hammock in the garden, strung up between two Artillerinut trees (those are the trees that shot at her just before she and I met. I felt so bad about that!). I would eat dinner in the elementary school dining hall with my friends, and then I would go out and head for the middle school building. On the way, I’d take a detour to the garden and spend the night there. I’d wake up with the rising sun and go over to the middle school dormitory, and slip into my room and change clothes while my roommate was at breakfast. Then I’d go to breakfast, attend morning classes, then slip back into the room and change into my gardening clothes, and go work in the garden through afternoon classes, heading over to the clubroom when the elementary school classes let out.</p>
<p>But yesterday, I’d stepped through the dewy grass, cool with the air of the setting sun, and lain down on my hammock only to find there was a chilly breeze passing between the two trees, which made it too cold to sleep there. I had thought for a minute about what to do. I decided to sneak into the clubroom; no one would be there at this time of night.</p>
<p>The gates of the elementary school area were shut, but all I had to do was climb the fence and I was in. I couldn’t directly climb on the tall, smooth black iron poles, but there was a nice growth of ivy wrapped around them that I could use to climb up to the top, as long as I kept my weight spread out enough that I didn’t break any of the vines. I clambered over the spiky tops of the poles and came down in the courtyard, glad for my thick boots that absorbed the shock of my hard landing.</p>
<p>The office building looked eerie in the twilight, like a haunted house just before the Witching Hour was to begin. Rays of orange light were bouncing off the windows, like the glow in the eyes of a dying tiger. But even though I felt like I was doing something bad, I knew I had to get in there. Otherwise I might wake up tomorrow with a cold, and then who would look after the garden?</p>
<p>I came around the building to the tall white doors, so happy and inviting by day, so gloomy and forbidding by evening. The lights in the lobby were still on, but it looked like most of the windows were dark. I tried the knob. It was still unlocked, so someone was inside, but I hoped I’d be able to get to the clubroom without being spotted.</p>
<p>My hopes were dashed the moment I opened the door; standing in the lobby, just getting ready to lock up, was one of the elementary school teachers. He wasn’t very old; like Miss Hanover, he looked like he’d just gotten out of college. Everything about him gave off an air of precision: his neatly combed hair, his crisp white shirt, his pressed and pleated slacks, and his tie, which somehow seemed to stay perfectly flat against his front, even when his movements should have made it flap. I didn’t know his name, but I didn’t think he’d be very happy about me being here so late, so I tried to quickly steal inside and hide in a dark corner next to the door.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t quick enough, and the teacher saw me. “Oh, hello,” he said. “I was just about to lock up. Did you need something?”</p>
<p>Caught, I came forward into the light. I knew my only chance was to lie. I’ve always been a terrible liar, though, so it was a slim chance. But I tried anyway. “Um, I just forgot something in my clubroom,” I said. “I came back to get it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, okay. Do you want me to walk up with you? Then I can lock up afterwards. Mrs. Henderson—” She was the secretary who oversaw the front office. “—will have my skin if I forget.” He held up a shiny brass key, which must have been the key to the two tall white doors I had just come through.</p>
<p>“Um, that’s all right. I-I can get it by myself. Um, just go ahead and lock up. I’ll find my own way out.”</p>
<p>Anyone with eyes could see I was carrying a blanket and pillow, and anyone with a brain could work out that I didn’t need those things to get something I’d forgotten in the clubroom. Also, unless I was a magician (which I wasn’t), there was no way I could just find my own way out of a locked building. So it was a pretty weak lie, like most of mine. And this teacher I didn’t know was looking at me with suspicion, like he thought I was lying, which I was. I wanted to sink back into the corner and become a potted plant, like the one behind the reception desk, just so I didn’t have to see him staring at me.</p>
<p>“You’re Lily van Rossum, aren’t you?” the teacher asked.</p>
<p>“Y-yes…How did you know?”</p>
<p>“Miss Hanover told me that you’re the president of some sort of volunteer club…the Helping Hands?”</p>
<p>I ventured a little bit further out of the corner, a little bit closer to the teacher. “That’s right,” I said. This seemed like a weird thing to be talking about if he were going to yell at me and put me in detention, so I thought he probably wasn’t. “We like using our unique gifts to help people. Of course, we’ll help anyone who needs it. We helped Ms. Rutherford clear the old PE sheds, and we helped Mrs. Julian on the Geology Club camping trip, and two of our members, Nora and Cora, helped the student council get rid of a stray dog that was causing trouble.”</p>
<p>“Are any of your members good at puzzles?” the teacher asked.</p>
<p>I certainly wasn’t, and I couldn’t see Cora being any good at them. Nora and Ranta might be okay, but I didn’t think either of them were secret masters of puzzles. “I don’t think so,” I said.</p>
<p>“Well, I guess it doesn’t matter that much if they’re good or not…Listen, I’m Daniel Wardlaw. I’m the faculty supervisor for the Puzzle Club.” He held out his hand. I came forward, completely out of the dark corner, and shook it, finally convinced he wasn’t going to yell at me. “We’re holding a Puzzle Contest for the elementary school this weekend, but…we’re short on people. Only the members of the Puzzle Club have signed up to compete so far. We were really hoping to have a strong challenger, or at least some people good enough to recruit to the club.”</p>
<p>“You want me to enter my members?” I asked. “But, Mr. Wardlaw, I’ve just told you, I don’t think any of them are good at puzzles…”</p>
<p>“That’s okay. If people from outside the club enter, maybe it’ll get more people from outside to enter. At worst, we’ll have a few fillers for the early rounds before our people have to face each other. Besides,” Mr. Wardlaw added with a smile, “if you do this this for me, I could let you go up to your clubroom and get whatever you forgot, while I lock up and let you find your own way out.”</p>
<p>I felt a chill up my spine. He’d tricked me.</p>
<p>“I’ll do it,” I agreed.</p>
<p>“Good. By the way, Miss van Rossum, I don’t know why you’re sleeping in your clubroom, but if it’s anything I can help you with, please let me know. Miss Hanover tells me you’re a good girl and a good student, so I trust you have your reasons.” He went for the door, and flashed me a smile on his way out, his straight, white teeth shining gold in the light of the dying sun. “Well, I’ll just lock things up. Good night.”</p>
<p>“Ah…Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>Ah, he was really handsome when he smiled.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When I got up to the clubroom, I had a little trouble finding somewhere to sleep. I had first bedded down on the window seat. I knew Nora slept there sometimes, and I had liked being able to see the stars and the distant lights of the high school buildings across the campus. But the cold, damp drafts of air coming off the glass had eventually driven me to the sofa in the corner.</p>
<p>I had meant to wake up early the next day, but the sofa was so comfortable that I overslept; when I woke up, I could already hear teachers talking in the corridors outside the clubroom. I got up and hid my blanket and pillow in one of the cupboards. Now that tests were over and homework was starting to pick up again, it was possible I’d be able to sleep in my room tonight. But if I couldn’t, I’d be sure to get in here earlier, so I wouldn’t have another close call like yesterday.</p>
<p>I took a hairbrush from my satchel and, looking at my reflection in the big window, did my best to tame my hair. Rather than tie it into a long braid like I usually did, I just tied it back into a ponytail with a rubber band. I put on the spare pair of socks I always carried in my satchel (in case I got my feet wet watering something), then put my overalls and boots back on.</p>
<p>That done, I went out into the corridor. While it was unusual for a student to be in the office building early in the morning, it wasn’t unheard of, so when I passed by a pair of older women chatting in the hall, they didn’t give me a second look.</p>
<p>Rather than going out by the main doors, which might make Mrs. Henderson suspect something, I went up the hall towards the teachers’ lounge, where there was a staircase I could take down to the back exit. I passed out into the courtyard and headed for the dining hall.</p>
<p>When I got inside, I saw that Nora and Ranta were sitting together at a table in the far corner. Nora had her back to me, but Ranta noticed me come in and waved, and Nora turned and waved too. I waved back, smiling as best as I could. I didn’t go over to them right away, though; instead, I got in line for some scrambled eggs, pancakes, and fruit salad. I felt myself moving slowly on purpose, trying to put off the time I would have to tell them that we were entering a puzzle contest. In the past I had always let them choose whether they wanted to help me on a job or not. Now, I couldn’t afford to give them that choice, but I also couldn’t tell them what was really going on. It was making me nervous.</p>
<p>Finally, though, I couldn’t take any more time choosing my breakfast. I then went over to them, hoping they would be willing to help me.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Lily,” said Nora as I sat down next to her. A battered book called <em>The World’s Last Night</em>, by C.S. Lewis, lay on the table in front of her. She must have been reading it when Ranta found her.</p>
<p>“Morning,” I said.</p>
<p>“Looks like you left in a hurry,” said Ranta. “Were you in the garden?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I lied. “The calamomile is in bloom right now, and I wanted to make sure it didn’t cross-pollinate the chamorose, so I was doing some pruning.”</p>
<p>Ranta seemed to believe me, but Nora wore a troubled expression. While I ate my breakfast, Nora and Ranta went back to discussing books. Nora and Ranta are very different: Ranta is mature, calm under pressure, and outgoing, while Nora is shy and gets flustered easily. But they both like long, hard, dense books, books whose ideas I couldn’t even begin to understand. From what they were saying, I understood that Ranta had let Nora borrow <em>The World’s Last Night</em>, and that it was full of strange, difficult ideas about religion.</p>
<p>I was just finishing with my pancakes and getting into tea and fruit salad when Nora turned to me, squirming a little, and said, “Um, Lily? I notice you haven’t braided your hair.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I didn’t really have time,” I said. I kept my face on my fruit salad, hoping it wouldn’t give me away.</p>
<p>“Well, if it’s all right, would you like me to do it for you? Um, I used to braid my sister’s hair sometimes, so I’m not bad at it.”</p>
<p>Surprised and touched, I smiled. “I’d love that,” I said. “But I’ve got a lot of hair, so don’t worry about giving up if you get tired in the middle, okay?”</p>
<p>“I won’t,” said Nora.</p>
<p>I drank my tea without moving my head too much while Nora braided my hair and continued her conversation with Ranta. Partway through, Cora showed up, carrying her breakfast tray.</p>
<p>It looked like I wasn’t the only one who hadn’t had time to do her hair properly this morning. Cora’s hair was still black from when her brother had dyed it, and she hadn’t tied it into her usual twin ponytails. It was hanging loose, so full of knots that it looked like a patch of blackberry bramble which had overgrown a tangle of kudzu, which had then become the nesting site for several families of birds. Her eyes had a heavy, sleepless look to them, which didn’t really make sense to me, since she would have had to sleep on her hair to get it that messy.</p>
<p>“Um…Good morning, Cora,” said Nora uncertainly as Cora sat down next to Ranta.</p>
<p>“Morning.” She shot Nora a venomous scowl, making Nora flinch a little, then forced her face into a smile as she turned to me. “Lily, can I please do your hair next time?”</p>
<p>“Try doing your own hair first,” said Ranta.</p>
<p>They fought for about five minutes after that, but I ignored them, as I always did when they started fighting, and focused on my tea and the pleasant feeling of Nora’s small, soft hands in my hair.</p>
<p>After Cora and Ranta had finished fighting, I decided I’d better tell them about the job. Hoping they’d all agree to help me, I opened my mouth.</p>
<p>I forgot that I had tea in my mouth.</p>
<p>The tea went down my windpipe, and I coughed for about a minute. Nora patted me on the back to help it go down, and I opened my mouth again.</p>
<p>“Do any of you know Mr. Wardlaw?” I said.</p>
<p>“Wardlaw? Isn’t he that nutjob—” Cora began.</p>
<p>“The one who gave the assembly where he tried to teach us calculus?” Ranta said, nodding. “I know him. Half of my class hates him, and the other half have crushes on him because he’s handsome, but none of them understood a single word he said during that assembly.”</p>
<p>“I still have nightmares about it sometimes,” Nora sighed. “Where I’m being chased by those upside-down triangles and backwards sixes he kept writing on the board.”</p>
<p>This didn’t look good for me. They already knew him as a lunatic. But I had to ask anyway. “Mr. Wardlaw is the head of the Puzzle Club,” I said. “He needs more people to enter the puzzle contest this weekend. He asked if you could all enter.” I looked around at the abject terror on all of their faces, and quickly added, “Just so there’s someone from outside the club. I can’t enter, since middle schoolers aren’t allowed.”</p>
<p>“If the puzzles are anything like that assembly, you’ve got to be way past middle school to solve them,” said Ranta. “More like fourth year of college. Not just any college, either. Some math nerd school, like MIT. Sorry, Lily, but I don’t think my nerves can take it.”</p>
<p>My heart sank. I looked around at Cora and Nora, hoping for a volunteer. They both looked uncertain. I had to do something to get them in. It made me feel bad to take advantage of my friends like this, but I didn’t know what else to do; after all, I did owe Mr. Wardlaw one for last night.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath. “The truth is, I really need your help. I…got in trouble with Mr. Wardlaw last night. He told me he wouldn’t punish me if I could get some more people to enter the contest. I’m sorry, I don’t like asking like this…that’s why I didn’t say anything at first…but I do need your help. I’ll owe all of you an ice cream if you’ll do it.”</p>
<p>The three of them exchanged a look. Nora was the first to speak. “Um, if you really need my help, then of course I’ll help you,” she said. “After all, it can’t be worse than the hornet shed, or the dog, right?” she added, looking around at the others.</p>
<p>“The dog was only bad because you’re a flailer,” said Cora. “But you’re right. If it’s to help Lily, I’m in.”</p>
<p>“Me too,” said Ranta. “You should’ve told us you needed our help in the first place, Lily. Of course I’ll help.”</p>
<p>It made me happy that they all agreed to help me, and I was also glad that they hadn’t insisted on knowing how I’d gotten in trouble. I did wish I could’ve told them how nice Mr. Wardlaw actually was, though.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Not only did I feel bad about making Mr. Wardlaw sound a lot meaner than he really was, I also felt awful about lying to my friends like that.</p>
<p>The three of them went to Mr. Wardlaw with me so they could ask to enter the puzzle contest. When I saw how happy he was, I felt a little better, even if Nora was hiding behind her bangs the whole time and Ranta looked at him like he was a crazy, dangerous criminal when he nearly danced around the room with joy.</p>
<p>I felt terrible again after I found Nora asleep in the clubroom one day, lying on the window seat with a puzzle book open and laid over her face. I felt worst for asking her to get involved. Ranta was mature and calm, so she could handle the pressure of being in front of all those people and getting a puzzle wrong. I didn’t really care what happened to Cora. But Nora was shy and had a hard time being around strangers, so there was no doubt that she was having a hard time with this. But she’d still gone to the library to find puzzle books, hoping to make a good show of it.</p>
<p>I started sleeping in the dormitory again and didn’t have any more run-ins with teachers, and before I knew it, the weekend had come, and the day of the contest.</p>
<p>Since the weather was still nice, the contest was being held out on the grounds, outside the elementary school fence. I met the others at the elementary school gate, and we walked together to the site of the contest, halfway between the elementary school and the high school.</p>
<p>Cora once again looked awful, although she’d made a little effort to brush her hair this time. I wasn’t going to say anything, but Nora, compassionate soul that she is, asked if Cora was sleeping all right.</p>
<p>“No,” Cora growled, and Nora recoiled a little.</p>
<p>“Um, is s-something in particular keeping you awake?” she asked Cora.</p>
<p>“My roommate, Victoria. After she destroyed my brother’s old record player, I tried buying a new record player from the high school store to drown her out. But she wrote a song called ‘I Cannot Be Drowned Out By the Record Player Cora Bought at the High School Store’, and when she sang it next to the record player, the piece of junk shattered into pieces.”</p>
<p>“So her singing has been keeping you awake?” Nora asked.</p>
<p>“She’s been giving concerts of ‘I Cannot Be Drowned Out By the Record Player Cora Bought at the High School Store’ all around the dorm room whenever I’m trying to sleep,” Cora snarled.</p>
<p>We passed in silence under an old oak tree, its wide branches harboring a cool breeze. It was at peace here, I could feel, watching over us students as we played sports and took walks every day, and it was looking forward to the puzzle contest, as my friends were not.</p>
<p>“I wonder what kind of puzzles they’re going to have,” Ranta commented as we came out on the other side of the shade cast by the oak.</p>
<p>“I hope I’ve studied enough,” said Nora, a nervous chatter in her teeth. “I studied word puzzles and logic puzzles and riddles. I tried doing some number puzzles, but…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, someone who failed math would have trouble with those,” said Cora.</p>
<p>“And someone who failed reading would have trouble with word puzzles, and someone who failed thinking would have trouble with logic puzzles, so just what do you think you’re going to solve, Cora?” said Ranta.</p>
<p>“You shut up! And there’s no such subject as thinking!”</p>
<p>I blocked out their fighting as usual. I saw that Nora was fidgeting nervously at my side, her fingers woven together and wiggling back and forth, her eyes fixed on their movements. Figuring I could at least try to help her through the mess I’d made for her, I put my hand on her shoulder. “Don’t worry, Nora. It’ll be all right.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s just…Well, promise me you won’t think I’m bragging or anything?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” I agreed. I gently guided her around a large stone, which she hadn’t seen because she was so focused on what her fingers were doing.</p>
<p>“I, I’m usually good at school. It’s kind of the only thing I am good at. S-so it’s hard for me…to think about looking stupid in front of people. Please don’t think I’m bragging,” she added, her cheeks turning pink as she finally turned away from her fingers and looked at me.</p>
<p>“I don’t. You <em>are</em> good at school. You <em>are</em> smart. I know it, Nora. Even if you can’t answer a single puzzle, I know it. But since you are smart, and you’ve been studying, maybe you’ll even surprise them and take down one or two of their champions.”</p>
<p>Nora shook her head. “I-I won’t. But thanks for believing in me, Lily.”</p>
<p>Cora and Ranta stopped fighting as we reached the site of the contest. Obviously, Mr. Wardlaw hadn’t expected many people to turn up to watch; they’d only set up about twenty spectator chairs. Even that had been hoping for too much; there was no one at all in the audience. There were also eight chairs for the eight members of the Puzzle Club. I didn’t know any of the members; they were mostly boys, although there were two girls, one wearing a green T-shirt with a silver Chinese dragon painted on it, the other with a blonde ponytail and pink jeans with heart-shaped pockets.</p>
<p>Facing the spectator area from across a long table were three teachers, who I assumed were the judges: Mr. Wardlaw, Miss Hanover, and a third teacher, one I recognized from the middle school. She was short enough to be a middle school student, and her face had a round, childish look to it. Even Nora looked older than her. Her round, furry ears and fuzzy ball of a tail made her look like a teddy bear, and without her usual labcoat and glasses, her skirt and button-up shirt looked like doll clothes, like a child dressing up as her mother for fun. She wore her bruin-brown hair in a casual loose ponytail, far different from Miss Hanover’s carefully groomed carpet of red hair, and unlike the poised Miss Hanover and the excited Mr. Wardlaw, she was tapping her finger on the table and staring around, looking bored.</p>
<p>“They’ve got a student judging,” Ranta commented, indicating the third judge.</p>
<p>“She’s not a student,” I said, “and let’s try not to talk to her.”</p>
<p>“Do you know her?” Nora asked.</p>
<p>“She’s Ursula Huckle. She’s the science teacher at the middle school.”</p>
<p>“Is she a bear woman?” Nora seemed interested in getting a closer look, but Mr. Wardlaw had seen us coming and came forward eagerly to meet us.</p>
<p>“Good, good. Miss Rosen, Miss Reyes, Miss Fiorentino, may I please conduct you to your seats? Miss van Rossum, you may take a seat in the audience.”</p>
<p>This was the first time I’d ever heard their last names; I still didn’t know which name belonged to who. I imagined that Ranta was Miss Reyes.</p>
<p>I took a seat in the audience (I had my pick of the best ones; I tried to sit where Miss Huckle wouldn’t have any reason to notice me), and Mr. Wardlaw began the contest.</p>
<p>“Okay, here’s how it’ll go,” he said. “I’ll call two names. I’ve got you all matched up here—” He held up a piece of paper. “You’ll sit down there—” He waved his hand at two chairs which had been set up facing the judges’ table. “I’ll give you three puzzles, one at a time. If you think you have an answer, raise your hand and tell us. If you win two puzzles of the three, you win the round. If you lose a round, you’re out, and you have to go sit in the audience. If no one gets an answer within five minutes, we’ll move on to a new puzzle, and try that one on the next pair. Miss Hanover—” Miss Hanover smiled and gave a cheerful wave. “—and Miss Huckle—” Miss Huckle sneered, her cute, round face twisting with contempt. “—will be judging your answers. Does everyone understand?”</p>
<p>There was a murmur of confirmation from the contestants. “Okay,” said Mr. Wardlaw. “Then our first round will be Mr. Locke versus Miss Reyes!”</p>
<p>Ranta came forward, along with a brown-haired boy wearing a bandanna around his head. “Okay, your first puzzle is a word puzzle,” announced Mr. Wardlaw. “What’s a word that has three of one letter, two of another letter, and one of three more letters, one of them <em>z</em>? Additionally, if you change the first two letters, it goes from your kitchen to your bathroom.”</p>
<p>I could see why no one had turned up to watch this. It wasn’t very interesting, watching Ranta and Locke squirm nervously as they tried to think of an answer to this insane question. At the end of five minutes, neither of them had an answer. Both of them also failed at the next question, a riddle: “I harvest the earth, live by the earth, breathe in the earth. I work the earth without end; I never put my spade down, even when I die. Who am I?” But Locke managed to win by answering the third puzzle after three minutes; he figured out that the word “you can inflate by three letters to go from one round thing to another” was <em>ball</em>, which you could add to and get <em>balloon</em>.</p>
<p>Ranta came to join me in the spectator’s area after she had lost. “That was brutal,” she said. “Can’t wait to see Cora get thrashed.”</p>
<p>Her chance to see Cora get thrashed came soon, because Cora (who, it turned out, was “Miss Fiorentino”) was called up next, along with Mr. Figaro, a blond-haired boy with a very strong chin. Cora proceeded to stare at Mr. Wardlaw for fifteen solid minutes, looking more like a sheep than a cat, while Mr. Figaro puzzled over the first two questions from the last round. He had no more success with them than Ranta had, but he did tell the judges that the thing which you “feed to grow, water to kill” was a campfire.</p>
<p>“You should’ve come on the camping trip with us,” said Ranta as Cora came to join us in the spectator’s area. “You might have been able to get that one.”</p>
<p>“Oh shut up, Miss Amaranta Reyes,” Cora snapped. “Hope Nora’s up next, then she can lose quickly, and we can get out of here.”</p>
<p>It turned out that Nora was up next; she was called up to compete with Miss Chere, the girl in the Chinese dragon T-shirt. Mr. Wardlaw opened with the kitchen-to-bathroom question again. After about thirty seconds, Nora timidly raised her hand.</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss Rosen?” said Mr. Wardlaw.</p>
<p>“Um, well, I had a little time to think about this while I was waiting. Um, the word is f-f-‘freezers’, right?”</p>
<p>Mr. Wardlaw stared at Nora curiously, and Miss Hanover, who had so far just been trying to look politely interested, focused in on Nora and smiled at her. Even Miss Huckle looked interested.</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” Mr. Wardlaw conceded. “Can you explain why?”</p>
<p>“Um, well, ‘freezers’ has th-three <em>e</em>’s, t-two <em>r</em>’s, and one <em>f</em>, <em>s</em>, and <em>z</em>. And freezers are in your kitchen, b-but if you ch-change the first two letters into…” Nora trailed off, but Miss Hanover gestured for her to keep going, and she swallowed, and did. “If you change the first two letters to <em>tw</em>, you get ‘tweezers’—that’s something in your bathroom, right? So it ‘goes from your kitchen to your bathroom’.”</p>
<p>“That seems reasonable,” said Mr. Wardlaw, “but—”</p>
<p>“Oh, give it a rest, Daniel, she’s got it,” said Miss Huckle, speaking for the first time and surprising everyone. Her voice was just as cute as her face, just as teddy bear-like as her ears and tail, but somehow you still got the feeling you shouldn’t mess with her. Or maybe only I got that feeling, because I knew her.</p>
<p>“Okay. Correct. One point, Miss Rosen,” said Mr. Wardlaw.</p>
<p>“Look at her,” Cora whispered, pointing at Miss Chere, Nora’s opponent. She looked absolutely dumbstruck, as if she’d expected this contest to be a cakewalk and it had turned out the cakes had teeth.</p>
<p>Mr. Wardlaw then gave the second question he’d given to Ranta and her opponent: “I harvest the earth, live by the earth, breathe in the earth. I work the earth without end; I never put my spade down, even when I die. Who am I?”</p>
<p>After about twenty-five seconds, Nora timidly raised her hand again, and Mr. Wardlaw called on her. “Yes, Miss Rosen?”</p>
<p>“Um, is the answer a mole? Because they h-harvest the earth—they d-dig around for w-worms and r-roots, right? And they ‘w-work the e-earth w-without end’, looking for food. They ‘b-breathe in the earth’, right? B-because they smell the d-d-dirt wh-when they’re d-digging to find f-food. And their ‘spades’ are their h-h-hands, s-s-s…” Once again Nora trailed off, and once again Miss Hanover gave her an encouraging look, and Nora took off again. “Um, so they don’t put their spades down even when they die, because even when they’re d-dead, their hands are still attached to them, r-right?”</p>
<p>“Right again,” said Miss Huckle, and Miss Hanover beamed. Mr. Wardlaw looked confused, and until Miss Huckle poked him in the side, he didn’t even remember that Miss Chere had lost.</p>
<p>“Your friend cheated,” said Miss Chere once she’d taken her seat in the audience. “No one could’ve known that freezer question without cheating.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, how’d she do that? Mind-reading?” Cora demanded. “You’re just mad ’cause you lost!”</p>
<p>“I didn’t lose! You can’t lose to a cheater!”</p>
<p>“You’re just mad ’cause you’re dumber than that dumb-looking milksop girl!” Cora taunted.</p>
<p>“I—am—”</p>
<p>“Quiet in the audience!” barked Miss Huckle, and both Cora and Miss Chere immediately quieted down, mostly from shock that such a voice could come out of such a pudding bowl-faced, teddy bear-looking woman.</p>
<p>After that, I expected Mr. Wardlaw to call up several members of the Puzzle Club. And he did call up Mr. Locke and Mr. Figaro to face each other in the next round. (Mr. Figaro won.) Then he called up Nora to face Mr. Figaro.</p>
<p>“What word can you take one letter out of, rearrange a little, and get a word that only has two sounds in common with it?”</p>
<p>Again, that tentative hand, after about thirty seconds. “Um, ‘region’,” Nora suggested. “Take out the <em>o</em> and swap the <em>g</em> and <em>i</em> and you get ‘reign’, which only has <em>r</em> and <em>n</em> in common with ‘region’.”</p>
<p>“Right again,” said Miss Huckle.</p>
<p>“Very good,” said Mr. Wardlaw, although he didn’t seem to think it was very good—he seemed to think it was very hard to understand how it had happened. “Here’s your next puzzle. Suppose you take off in a hot-air balloon from the coast of Cornwall, heading over the sea. You rise to a height of 100 meters. You then drop a bag of sand over the side of the balloon. How long does it take for the bag of sand to hit the ground?”</p>
<p>Nora seemed to be struggling with this. Mr. Figaro seemed to take heart at her failure to respond within thirty seconds. I started to think about it. The bag would fall straight down. The acceleration of gravity would be 9.8 meters per second per second. If the balloon was 100 meters up, and the bag weighed—</p>
<p>I noticed that Nora had raised her hand. She looked even more nervous than she had before, and even seemed about ready to put her hand down, but at another encouraging smile from Miss Hanover, she kept it raised.</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss Rosen?” said Mr. Wardlaw.</p>
<p>“Um, well, um, I thought at first this might be a physics problem, and I’m…not so good at math, so I didn’t think I could solve it. But then I realized—um, well, you said the balloon is over the sea. So it’d never hit the ground, right? At least, not until it got to the ocean floor.”</p>
<p>I slapped myself in the forehead, so loud that Ranta turned and looked at me. Of <em>course</em> that was the answer!</p>
<p>But from the expression on his face, Mr. Figaro had been trying to solve it the same way I was. All three of us had thought it was a physics problem, but Nora—the one who had failed her math test—had quickly tried looking for a way around the math, and had found the right answer. That had to be right, because without knowing the mass of the sandbag, there was no way to calculate how fast it would fall through the air.</p>
<p>Mr. Figaro came to join us in the losers’ area. “Not quite like the stuff we do in the club, huh, Celice?” he said to Miss Chere and Mr. Locke, with a rueful smile. “Your friend is pretty cool, though,” he added to me, Ranta, and Cora.</p>
<p>“She cheated, Ed,” Celice said again. “Roll your eyes if you want, Cole!” she snapped at Mr. Locke. “But she’s cheating somehow.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, she cheated on four different questions, against two different challengers, and is such a good actress that she faked all that stuttering and cowering just so you’d buy it,” Cora scoffed.</p>
<p>I ignored them and turned my eyes to the challenger area. There were still five members of the Puzzle Club left, and Nora.</p>
<p>Mr. Wardlaw next called up Mr. Gau, a rangy boy with a blond crew cut, and Mr. Gabbiani, who was tall and had long, black hair. “It’s gotta be Seth,” said Cole.</p>
<p>It was; Mr. Gau came to join us in the losers’ area, and Mr. Wardlaw next called up Nora again to face Seth Gabbiani.</p>
<p>“I come once in a minute, twice in a moment, but not once in a thousand years. What am I?” said Mr. Wardlaw.</p>
<p>Nora’s nervous, tentative hand-raising happened almost immediately; even Miss Huckle seemed surprised.</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss Rosen?” she said, calling on Nora without bothering to wait for Mr. Wardlaw.</p>
<p>“It’s the letter <em>m</em>,” said Nora.</p>
<p>“Correct,” said Miss Huckle.</p>
<p>One question later, Seth came to join us in the losers’ area.</p>
<p>Now the members of the Puzzle Club were flabbergasted; they hadn’t expected anyone from outside the club to even show up, let alone beat half of their members. The ones with us in the losers’ area were chattering excitedly under their breath; from what they said, I gathered that Celice was the second-strongest in the club, and that everyone had expected the final battle to come down to her and Tina Branford, the girl with the blonde ponytail and the pink jeans, who was the best in the club.</p>
<p>The Puzzle Club members still in the challengers’ area were quiet, but they were looking around, seeming unsettled. Mr. Wardlaw had his eyes on his desk, and I couldn’t tell if he was in pain or trying not to laugh. Whatever emotion he was feeling, it had made his tie finally leave his chest; it was now flapping in the breeze.</p>
<p>“Mr. Garamonde and Miss Rosen,” said Mr. Wardlaw, his piece of paper with the order of pairings off to the side, forgotten.</p>
<p>Once Nora had defeated Mr. Garamonde, she made to return to the challenger area, but Mr. Wardlaw said, “No, Miss Rosen, please just stay right there. Mr. Magus, please.”</p>
<p>The Puzzle Club members in the spectators area started chattering again.</p>
<p>“Come on, Strago,” Celice intoned. “Show everyone how she’s cheating.”</p>
<p>“Are you kidding?” said Cole. “That girl beat you. D’you think a runt like Strago has a chance?”</p>
<p>“She’s cheating somehow and Strago’s gonna show it!” Celice insisted.</p>
<p>I could see Cora about to say something and start a fight again. I touched Celice on the shoulder. “Celice,” I said. “Please stop accusing my friend of cheating.”</p>
<p>“Well, she is,” Celice insisted.</p>
<p>“I know Nora. She’s an honest person, probably the most honest person I’ve ever met. Her teeth were chattering when we walked down because she was so nervous that she wouldn’t look smart if she failed at these puzzles. She spent the last few days reading puzzle books so she could put on a good show for all of you. And she has. Don’t you think?” I looked around at everyone else for support, both the other Puzzle Club members and my own members. Everyone seemed to be nodding in agreement.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I was just expecting to get another boring contest that would end with Tina beating Celice again,” said Seth Gabbiani.</p>
<p>“I was really impressed when your friend worked out that hot air balloon puzzle,” said Ed Figaro. “I was doing it totally wrong, trying to work out how fast the bag would fall.”</p>
<p>“Me too,” I admitted.</p>
<p>“We don’t usually do anything this hard in club,” said Cyrus Garamonde. “It’s mostly playing with Möbius strips and slide puzzles and working on crosswords. We weren’t ready, but you guys must’ve been even more not ready than us, huh? But your friend still beat all of us.”</p>
<p>Everyone else seemed to agree, but Celice didn’t look convinced, so I said, “Besides, Miss Hanover is one of the judges and she has the Gift of Trickery. Do you really think if there was any cheating going on, she wouldn’t know it?.”</p>
<p>Celice pouted and didn’t answer right away. “Fine, you’re right,” she admitted at last. “Miss Hanover would see if there was any cheating going on. So your friend is really good at puzzles. And you sneaked her in, knowing she’d make fools of us all.”</p>
<p>“We didn’t know anymore than you did,” said Ranta.</p>
<p>“We all thought she was just some idiot who used words no one could understand,” said Cora.</p>
<p>“What’s this ‘we all’? I never thought that!” said Ranta.</p>
<p>“So your friend was a puzzle genius and you had no idea?” said Celice. “You were calling her dumb all this time when she was smarter than any of you?”</p>
<p>“<em>I</em> never called her dumb!” said Ranta.</p>
<p>While the three of them fought, Nora easily defeated Strago on two easy puzzles. Mr. Wardlaw probably watered them down since Strago was, as Cole had said, the runt of the club. But he must have known that easier puzzles would give Nora an even bigger advantage.</p>
<p>With Strago coming to join us in the audience, that left just Tina and Nora. Mr. Wardlaw gestured to Tina that she should come to the battle area, and she did, moving with a calm air to her. She reminded me of a poplar tree: tall, outwardly calm, but with energy and passion inside her. She stopped by Nora’s chair to shake hands before sitting down in her own chair and waiting for Mr. Wardlaw, Miss Hanover, and Miss Huckle to finish a quick, whispered discussion.</p>
<p>“Let’s begin the final round,” said Mr. Wardlaw. He was looking a little disheveled; his perfectly combed hair had started to fall a bit, and there were wrinkles in his shirt from the way he’d been twisting around while Miss Hanover and Miss Huckle took Nora’s responses. I noticed he’d taken off his tie and laid it on the table next to his forgotten sheet of match orderings.</p>
<p>“Your friend is going down,” Celice whispered to me, Cora, and Ranta. “She may be good, but Tina’s the best.”</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s start the final round with a number puzzle,” said Mr. Wardlaw. “A warrior in ancient India once saved the kingdom from a demon. In return, the king offered the warrior anything in the kingdom.”</p>
<p>“The warrior told the king that all he wanted was some rice. He asked the king to take a chess board with sixty-four squares. ‘On the first day,’ he told the king, ‘put one grain of rice on the first square. On the second day, put two grains on the second square. On the third day, put four grains on the third square. On each day, put on the next square twice the number of grains which was on the previous square. When each square of the board has a pile of rice, I will take all the grains of rice on the board as my reward.’ The king thought this was a very meager prize. Was he right? Should the warrior have asked for something else?”</p>
<p>Nora and Tina both started working. I could see Nora struggling. It was a numbers thing, which wasn’t her strength.</p>
<p>“Ah, I see. Wardlaw decided to get rid of your friend,” said Celice. “This number stuff is Tina’s specialty.”</p>
<p>“So he’s going to cheat?!” Cora exclaimed.</p>
<p>“No, that must be what he discussed with Miss Hanover and Miss Huckle before he asked the question,” I said. “He knew he was asking a hard number puzzle, and he wanted to clear it with them so they wouldn’t think he was cheating.”</p>
<p>After three minutes, Tina raised her hand and gave the answer. “The king is wrong,” she said. “Based on my calculations, the king will end up owing the warrior about 36,000,000,000,000,000,000 grains of rice. Even if a pound of rice has a million grains in it, that comes out to more than 36 trillion pounds of rice.”</p>
<p>“That’s correct,” said Mr. Wardlaw.</p>
<p>The defeated members of the Puzzle Club gave a whoop, though Ed turned around to say “Nothing against you guys.”</p>
<p>Nora’s face had fallen, and she was looking down at her interwoven fingers again as they wiggled back and forth. Even though she’d done well on all the other puzzles, it seemed like her confidence was falling now that she’d been defeated.</p>
<p>Even though I’d roped her into this to get myself out of trouble, and I’d felt bad about doing it earlier, this had unexpectedly turned out to be a good thing for Nora—she’d discovered something she was good at, and it even looked like she’d impressed Miss Huckle, who was never impressed with anything. Even though there wouldn’t be any shame in losing to the Puzzle Club’s strongest when no one had expected anything out of her, I still felt like I wanted to see Nora win.</p>
<p>So, even though I was risking Miss Huckle’s wrath by making noise, I stood up, moved to the front of the spectator’s area, and cried out to her.</p>
<p>“Nora!” I called. “Don’t lose confidence! She hasn’t won yet!”</p>
<p>“She’s right, Nora!” Ranta joined in. “You can still win this!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, show these dorks you can out-dork the dorkiest of them!” Cora added.</p>
<p>“Down in front!” Miss Huckle barked, and with a squeak I shrank back into my seat.</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell if our words had helped Nora get into the mindset to win, but she did unweave her fingers and look at Miss Hanover, who gave her another smile. It was an encouraging smile, like before, but there was also a mystery to it, like a sphinx’s smile.</p>
<p>“Next puzzle,” said Mr. Wardlaw. “You are working aboard a ship. There are three crates in the hold, one of them labeled ‘Apples’, one labeled ‘Oranges’, and one labeled ‘Apples &amp; Oranges’. Unfortunately, these labels are all wrong. Since the fruit buyers don’t want to fruit with finger marks all over it, your job is to choose one crate, take one piece of fruit out of it, and use that to figure out where the labels go.”</p>
<p>Tina didn’t look as confident about this one, and I thought I knew why: this wasn’t something you could just calculate your way through, like she’d done with the grains of rice puzzle. She looked like she was concentrating very hard on it, squirming around in her seat like an earthworm, as if the movements of her body were mirroring the way her mind was working.</p>
<p>Nora stared thoughtfully off into the distance. Tina kept on raising her hand, but before anyone could call on her, she would put it down and start squirming again.</p>
<p>After about two minutes, Tina went to raise her hand again, then lowered it; just as she began to lower her hand, Nora raised her own.</p>
<p>“Miss Rosen?” said Miss Huckle.</p>
<p>“Um, so every single label is wrong, right?” said Nora.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Wardlaw.</p>
<p>“So the crate marked ‘Apples &amp; Oranges’, really, it’s just one or the other, right? Because that label is definitely wrong. So if we get one fruit out of that crate, we know which label goes on it. If we get an orange, we put the ‘Oranges’ label on it, and if we get an apple, we put the ‘Apples’ label.”</p>
<p>“Right so far,” said Miss Huckle.</p>
<p>“So, if we got an orange out of that crate, we put the ‘Oranges’ label on it. Then we have a crate with no label, a label with no crate, and a crate marked ‘Apples’. Since we know that one’s wrong, that crate must really be ‘Apples &amp; Oranges’, because the first crate was ‘Oranges’. Then we know the last crate, the one with no label, must be ‘Apples’.”</p>
<p>“Correct,” said Miss Huckle. “So, we now have Miss Branford with one point and Miss Rosen with one point. The last problem will decide the game. Mr. Wardlaw?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Wardlaw. “The last problem. Let’s say that you come to a pair of doors. One of those doors is guarded by Miss Hanover, and the other by Miss Huckle. Miss Hanover tells you that behind one door is a freezer full of ice cream, and behind the other is a mountain of math homework. She and Miss Huckle both know which door is which; one of them will always tell the truth whenever you ask her a question, and the other one will always lie. You can ask one of them one question to find the door you want. How do you figure out which door is which?”</p>
<p>“I know this one!” said Tina, raising her hand immediately. “Ask Miss Hanover which door Miss Huckle would say has the ice cream behind it. If Miss Hanover is the liar, she’ll say that Miss Huckle would tell me to take the door with the math homework, which will be a lie, because Miss Huckle would be the truth-teller, and she’d show me the right door. And if Miss Hanover is the truth-teller, she’ll <em>still</em> say that Miss Huckle would tell me to take the door with the math homework, because Miss Huckle would be the liar, and Miss Hanover would tell me, truthfully, that she would lie.”</p>
<p>My head was spinning trying to follow that logic. Ranta wasn’t following it either, and Cora had given up and started chasing grasshoppers around the field as they enjoyed the last warm days before autumn. But it looked like Tina had one; she seemed so sure of herself that I didn’t think she could be wrong.</p>
<p>“Except…” Nora began, then stopped and raised her hand.</p>
<p>“Go ahead, Nora,” said Miss Hanover.</p>
<p>“Um, Mr. Wardlaw said originally that Miss Hanover told us that one door had ice cream and the other had math homework. But if Miss Hanover is the liar, then <em>that</em> could be a lie. Maybe both doors are full of math homework. She could even be lying that one of them always tells the truth—maybe they both lie all the time. So I don’t think the question has an answer.”</p>
<p>“Correct. Miss Rosen wins the contest,” said Miss Huckle.</p>
<p>I couldn’t believe it—Nora had won! I jumped out of my seat and ran to her, totally forgetting myself as I threw my arms around her, crying “You won! You won! And you were worried you’d look stupid—you looked smarter than all of us put together!”</p>
<p>Ranta was close behind me, and also gave Nora a hug. Nora looked happy, but also surprised. But her surprise was nothing next to Mr. Wardlaw; he was staring at her with eyes the size of palm leaves, his gaping mouth opening and closing slowly like a big-mouthed bass. Miss Hanover was beaming, and even Miss Huckle was actually smiling.</p>
<p>Once Ranta had released Nora from her hug, Tina came over to shake Nora’s hand. “You beat me fair and square,” she said. “You’re an amazing puzzle solver.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Nora, her cheeks turning red again. “I’m sorry, I didn’t even know I was good at them until today, otherwise…”</p>
<p>“It just shows me I have a lot to learn,” said Tina. She went to rejoin her companions from the Puzzle Club. Celice looked unhappy, but it didn’t seem like she thought Nora was cheating anymore.</p>
<p>Mr. Wardlaw had finally collected himself enough to come around the judge’s table with Miss Hanover and Miss Huckle. “Nice work, kid,” said Miss Huckle. “Look me up when you get to middle school next year. We’ll work on some physics, some differential equations, a little programming. You’ll be a researcher by the time you’re in high school.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Miss Huckle, but I’m hopeless with numbers,” said Nora shyly.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t matter. That’s what computers are for. Ask your friend Lily to show you my office.” She jerked her head at me, and I winced reflexively, causing her to sneer. “Well, I’ve got some work to do. Daniel, Anne, see you later.” She left, heading back towards the middle school building. I could see Nora watch her go, watch how her fuzzy little tail swayed as she walked. I had once wanted to grab that tail and stroke it, just to feel the fur. Now I knew that doing so would be even more dangerous than grabbing a real bear’s tail.</p>
<p>Mr. Wardlaw came forward, his handsome face serious and stern, his appearance more rumpled than I’d ever thought it could be. Nora, Ranta, and I sobered a little, our eyes on him, wondering what he was going to do.</p>
<p>To everyone’s surprise, Mr. Wardlaw sank to his knees on the grass in front of Nora and bowed his head to the dirt. “Please, Miss Rosen, I’m begging you—won’t you join the Puzzle Club?”</p>
<p>“Um, I’m sorry, Mr. Wardlaw, but I can’t,” said Nora. “You see, I already promised Lily I would stay in her club.”</p>
<p>“You can switch if you want, Nora,” I said. “I won’t hold you back.” Though I really wanted to hold her back, really thought it wouldn’t be worth it if I couldn’t come into the clubroom every day and find her on the window seat or at the table, reading, and ask her what she was reading, and hear the excitement in her voice as she talked about it.</p>
<p>Nora shook her head. “No, I love being in this club. If not for this club, I never would have entered this puzzle contest. I’m staying here.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wardlaw stood up, looking deflated, like a sun-dried tomato. “I see. Well, if you change your mind, come and see me.” He went over to the members of the Puzzle Club and directed them to start cleaning up. It seemed that they had dragged the chairs and the tables out here themselves.</p>
<p>Miss Hanover stepped up and put a hand on Nora’s shoulder, her smile as wide as a jack o’ lantern’s. “Good job, Nora,” she said. “I knew you could do it.”</p>
<p>“Miss Hanover,” I said as Cora approached, finally having realized that the contest was over and she could stop chasing grasshoppers. “Since Nora won the puzzle contest, does that mean she gets to end math tutoring? After all, some of those puzzles were math, and Nora did pretty good with them.”</p>
<p>Miss Hanover’s smile didn’t waver at all as she said, “No, Nora, I actually think we should do extra math tutoring. After all, you can obviously do math, so it seems you were just being lazy on your exam.”</p>
<p>Nora looked as deflated as Mr. Wardlaw had a second ago, and Cora looked horrified, possibly because she hadn’t realized Miss Hanover could be so cruel. But I knew Miss Hanover just a little bit better than they did. “Oh, stop being mean,” I said. “Look at poor Nora!”</p>
<p>Miss Hanover chuckled. “You’re right. I’m sorry, Nora. I think you just don’t do well with numbers, but whenever a problem is given in words, you can solve it. You did get all the word problems on your last test right. And I bet you can explain in words why Tina’s answer to the grains of rice problem was correct, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Nora. “Since every pile of rice is twice as large as the last one, not only is the amount of rice getting bigger every day, but the rate that the amount of rice is getting bigger is also getting bigger. The number you double each day is double the number you doubled last time. So the piles of rice get huge really quickly. And then you add them all up, and you’ve got a really really huge pile of rice!” She held her arms up to the sky.</p>
<p>“A really really huge pile!” Cora repeated, also throwing her arms up to the sky.</p>
<p>“Did you catch a really really huge pile of grasshoppers, Cora?” Ranta asked. “Where are they, did you eat them?”</p>
<p>“Shut up, Amaranta!”</p>
<p>Ignoring their usual fighting, I turned to Nora and said, “Should we help them clean up?”</p>
<p>“That’s an easy one,” said Nora.</p>
