I think a good way to do a Sudoku solver might be with an interference graph (kind of like the ones they use in compiler optimization) with vertices representing squares and edges going to squares that could interefere (e.g. square (0, 0) is connected to (0, 1) because they're in the same row; it's connected to (1, 0) because they're in the same column; it's connected to (2, 1) because they're in the same 3x3 square, but it's not connected to (4, 4) because putting something there can only indirectly affect (0, 0)).
