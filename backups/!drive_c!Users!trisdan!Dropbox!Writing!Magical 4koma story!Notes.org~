* Characters
** Nora
*** Stats
Full name: Nora Emily Rosen
Date of  birth: April 4th
Hair: Brown, wears in A-line
Eyes: Green
Ancestry: Irish
As of story's beginning:
Height: 5'2"
Weight: 110 lbs
Age: 11
*** Concrete
The main character. A shy and stuttering girl who hides behind her long bangs when scared. Dogs hate her for some reason, and bark at her when she approaches, which scares her. She has a dreamy nature and loves poetry and the natural world. Her Gift is unknown at the beginning of the story. In sixth grade. An above-average student. 

Her middle name comes from poet Emily Dickinson.

*** Notional
She skipped fourth grade, so she is actually younger than the others. (That's part of why her math is so bad—she was ahead of the curve in everything else but average in math, so she's still catching up.) [The way I draw her, she has breasts, and she's kind of tall and thin too, so she definitely doesn't look younger. That's why it's notional.]

(Roosevelt? wanted more Irish sound. Briallen? Linnaeus? Rosen? Roisin?) [Names I considered]

Her mother, Carol, is an actuary and gifted with numbers. Her father, Lawrence (never Larry) is a professor of literature. Both are very serious and straightlaced, though kind and very interested in raising their children well.

Her Gift is breaking into weird places (the recursive world, the wormhole in the applegate, the labyrinth, the cafe in the snow). Alternately, her Gift is manifestation (she created the labyrinth unconsciously so she could pay Ranta back for saving her in The Camping Trip, and the others are just coincidence.)
** Lily
*** Stats
Full Name: Lily van Rossum
Date of Birth: April 31st
Hair: Blonde, long, often in single braid
Eyes: Blue
Ancestry: Dutch
As of story's beginning:
Height: 5' 4"
Weight: 117 lbs
Age: 12
*** Concrete
President of the Helping Hands Club, which has the goal of helping anyone with a problem. Has the Gift of Gardening, which makes her able to intuitively understand the needs of plants, as well as giving her the ability to grow some very unusual plants like the Strawberry Sunflower. Makes friends easily and has them all over the place. Although she seems very gentle she has a strong underlying nature. Becomes Nora's first friend in the school when Miss Hanover sends Nora to join the Helping Hands. In the seventh grade. 

Her last name comes from Python creator Guido van Rossum.

*** Notional
Has four younger brothers and sisters and grew up in relative poverty. Her parents used to fight about money a lot and divorced. She's sort of a Cloud Cuckoolander, like Harry Potter's Luna Lovegood (but without believing in the Crumple-Horned Snorkack or any of that. It's more in a cheesy way like she talks about believing in yourself and stuff). She is bullied, but not outright; she's bullied in a subtle way by being ostracized and by people hiding her things. No one tries to beat her up or does anything openly inflammatory. Some of the boys in the high school are attracted to her. 

[Another idea: Lily's stepfather doesn't like her and part of her reason for going to St. Galgani's was to be away from him. But given what a sweetheart she is, it's already hard enough to explain how widely disliked she is—by her roommate, Alexis; by the Wooden Girls; by the other girls in her grade in the middle school.]

Lily's classmates hate flowers and plants, so Lily hates them. She hates middle school students in general, which is why most of her friends are from the elementary school or the high school. (I decided to go with her just not seeing eye to eye with their desire to grow up faster since she wants to stay a kid for a while after seeing what her parents went through.)

She has a roommate who doesn't like her and divides the room in half with a curtain. Sometimes the roommate's friends all come over and the room is so loud that she can't sleep and has to go find somewhere else to sleep. She tried telling one time but everyone got mad at her and she came to class to find her desk gone the next day, so she doesn't anymore.

** Cora
*** Stats
Full Name: Cora Yolanda Fiorentino
Date of Birth: July 19th
Hair: Orange with white stripes
Eyes: Yellow
Ancestry: Italian and tabby
As of the story's beginning:
Height: 4'9"
Weight: 96 lbs
Age: 11
*** Concrete
A cat girl with glasses and twin tails in Nora's class. At first she is mean to Nora, but she idolizes Lily because Lily helped her out a while ago when she was in trouble. She comes to the club and discovers Nora there and decides to try and be friends with Nora as a way to get closer to Lily. Not very smart and a tsundere with a bad temper. Also has a good side, though, as we see in some of the stories. Active and good at sports. Like Nora, she starts the story as a Potential.

Has a roommate, Victoria, who has the gift of singing and loves opera. Cora doesn't like opera. She tries many ways to avoid hearing it.

She likes Lily because Lily saved her from the Wooden Girls' wrath by claiming to be the evil mastermind and taking the heat off her. See plot notes for "Alone with Lily" for more explanation.
*** Notional
She often does strange things because of her temper, like throwing a book at the window when she can't read it. She believes people like her only because she is good at sports. She wants to find friends who will like her for who she is, including the strange parts, and won't leave her when she can't control her temper. That's (another reason) why she tried to befriend Lily.

Her glasses are fake. She wears them because she's trying to look more intellectual like her father (who is a psychiatrist) and her brother. Lily tells her later that she doesn't need fake glasses to change what friends she has; she has to change what kind of person she is.  

She became popular when she was younger, but now she's not growing up as fast as the other girls, and is still having temper tantrums and being pissy and showing no interest in boys, clothes, or makeup. Amy, the goth-loli girl, capitalizes on this and humiliates Cora, turning the popular girls against her as part of a plot to make Cora become friends with her instead. 
** Ranta
*** Stats
Full name: Amaranta Julia Eufemia Marikit de los Reyes III (final version)
Date of Birth: December 1st
Hair: Dark brown
Eyes: Violet
Ancestry: Filipino (Pacific Islander type)
As of the story's beginning:
Height: 5' 5"
Weight: 123 lbs
Age: 11
*** Concrete
 A tomboyish girl who likes sports. Has short hair and the Gift of Running, which allows her to run further and faster than a normal human (superhuman, but not really at the level of The Flash). Cora considers her a rival at sports and they're also rivals at test scores, although both of them have awful test scores. Ranta secretly likes reading, so she makes a connection with Nora when they meet in the library. A competent and caring person at heart, who believes in fair play. Her name is short for Amaranta; her full name is Amaranta Julia Eufemia Marikit de los Reyes III, after her grandmother and mother, and she comes from a rich family. She is Filipino but grew up in the United States. She is a sixth grader like Nora and Cora but is in the other class (there are only two). 

Her family owns a big house in San Francisco.

** Miss Hanover
*** Stats
Full name: Anne Hanover
Date of Birth: September 30th
Hair: Red (like the Red Fox)
Eyes: Brown
Ancestry: English, Fox girl
As of the story's beginning:
Height: 5'7"
Weight: 119 lbs
Age: 27
*** Concrete
The teacher of class 6-1 (Nora and Cora's class). Lily's former teacher. Has the Gift of Trickery. This makes her adept at both playing tricks on others and seeing through tricks played on her. 

A former student of St. Galgani's, and one of the few teachers who is. She went to college at alternate reality UC San Diego and got a degree in Classics with a double minor in literature and education; she also has a Master's of Education that she completed in one year after her bachelor's. Started working at St. Galgani's on an internship during her Master's degree and became an official employee when she was twenty-five.

*** Notional
Her rival in high school and college was Wilhelmina Shortz, a Grey Fox woman with the Gift of Gaming. Wilhelmina's gift let her quickly understand and apply the rules of games, finding good strategies (similar to Keima Katsuragi when he thrashes Haqua at Almagemachina that he's never played before). But Miss Hanover was able to overcome her with trickery (not cheating, per se). Miss Hanover has refused to play any more games with her ever since they got out of college, so Wilhelmina kidnaps the Helping Hands and holds them hostage to make Miss Hanover play her.

Unbeknownst to Wilhelmina, Miss Hanover threw her chance at a prestigious scholarship / internship opportunity in Sweden to let Wilhelmina go. This was because Miss Hanover also had the St. Galgani's internship, which she was equally satisfied with, and she wanted to let the other one go to someone who valued it more.
** Secondary Characters
*** Aurelio Julio Octavio Mahal de los Reyes III
Ranta's older brother, a delicate and fairy-ish high school boy who makes costumes for the high school's drama club. Ranta is embarrassed by him. Goes by 'Rel', the same way Ranta goes by 'Ranta'. 

Has the Gift of Teleportation [Instant Transmission? Apparition, to borrow a phrase from Harry Potter?]. It's similar to Kuroko Shirai's teleportation in To Aru Kagaku no Railgun. He has a range limit that gets longer as he gets older. He can bring others along as long as he's touching them (but he has to be touching the person—if he's just touching the clothes, the clothes get teleported off the person and go with him). There's a vague weight / size limit to bringing people along; he could bring three people of Nora's size, six or seven babies, and one full-grown adult. There's no "calculations" like with Kuroko; he just has to imagine the place he wants to be, and have sufficient will to reach it (just enough so that his powers don't activate when he imagines home and thinks "I sure do miss that place").

There's no "effect" when he teleports; he just suddenly isn't there anymore, as if you blinked and he was gone. A camera would just measure him there one frame and gone the next. He doesn't find this theatrical enough, so he likes to carry smoke bombs and powder balls to make it look cooler. 
*** Lucian Rolando Fiorentino
Cora's older brother. Looks like their mother and has a snide, princely air about him. Loves teasing Cora; he tricks her into taking lots of allergy medication and falling asleep, then dyes her hair black in "Cora's Weekend". Calls her "Orangey", which bothers her. In medical school, training to be a pediatrician.
*** Annamaria Fiorentino
Cora's little sister. Four years old. Looks like Cora (and their father). 
*** Linda Siobhan Rosen
Nora's big sister. Their parents are both serious and straightlaced people, very bookish and unassuming. Nora is like them, but because she grew up with the wild and irresponsible Linda, she has a bit of a sarcastic side. Linda is four years older than Nora (so 15 when the story begins) and acts like a grubby twelve-year-old boy. She likes soccer, bows and arrows, and pranks. Recently she's become aware of her good looks and started trying to doll herself up a little. [She'd get along well with Lucian, ne?]
*** Asha Grayson
Daughter of Mr. Grayson, the teacher who made Cora read /Ulysses/. In eighth grade. The fighter of the Wooden Twins (Graywood Girls? Graywood Twins?). Has the Gift of Might. An expy of Karen-chan. Her name is also a reference to Asha Greyjoy in /A Song of Ice and Fire/. 
*** Elma Grayson
Daughter of Mr. Grayson and twin sister of Asha (the younger twin, by nine minutes). In eighth grade. The planner (schemere?) of the Wooden Twins. Has the Gift of Swift Healing. An expy of Tsukihi-chan. No reference to ASoIaF.
*** Theona Grayson
Either the older or younger sister of the Wooden Twins. Who knows what role Theona will play. Her name is a reference to Theon Greyjoy from /A Song of Ice and Fire/. (So she ought to be younger, because Theon is younger than Asha.)
*** Akari Kanzaki
The same character from Neither Here Nor There, in her younger days living with her grandfather. 
*** Ursula Huckle
Lily's science teacher. A bear woman who looks twelve even though she's old enough to have taught Miss Hanover during Miss Hanover's senior year of high school. Made a deal with Lily that Lily could do whatever she wants during science lab periods as long as she keeps up with her theoretical work, and also as long as she writes reports on what she's doing for Miss Huckle. Miss Huckle adopted the dog from "Dogs don't like me for some reason!" when she discovered it roaming the grounds.
*** Daniel Wardlaw
A young, handsome teacher at the elementary school. Has a PhD. in math and an M.Ed. Came to St. Galgani's out of idealism but finds the work a little boring, and amuses himself doing independent math research and advising the puzzle club. In "Puzzles aren't that hard", he finds Lily sneaking into the office building to sleep in the clubroom (because her roommate has been having annoying parties and she can't sleep in there, but it's too cold to sleep in the hammock in the garden). Rather than kick her out, he lets her stay on the condition that she enter her junior members in the Puzzle Contest. This leads him to discover Nora's incredible skill at puzzles when she defeats his club's ace, Tina Branford. He develops a crush on Nora after this (in as non-creepy a sense as possible; it's more like he talks about her in pseudo-religious tones). Lily has sort of a crush on him in turn. (although she's just as likely to pursue her yuri crush on Nora if it comes right down to it.)  
*** Other Members of Class 6-2
**** Greta and Sweta
A pair of twins. Look like pigs. Friends and servants of Cora. They like trashy daytime soap operas and Cora. Members of the Fiorentino family.
**** Gracie
A friend and servant of Cora. Member of the Fiorentino family. African-American ancestry.
**** Willow
Another member of the Fiorentino family. Sits next to Cora in class. Copies Cora's homework even though she knows it's wrong. 
**** Leah
Another member of the Fiorentino family. Stylish, fashionable, wears brand-name clothes and has carefully tended auburn curls. Loves giving makeovers. Known as the Mad Makeover Queen.
**** Amy
Originally the wooch, gopher, servant, and brown-noser of Cora and her friends, she organized the Fiorentino family and concocted the plan to take Nora hostage. Very small. Has black hair usually cut in a Dutch bob. Likes to dress in black (you could call her a goth loli). Likes /Horror High/, the terrible series of books that later became a cartoon about Draculicious, Werewolfina Jr. and Sr., Ghostricia, Frostina, Frankenbaby, and Mummette (we're just staying away from Harlahotep IV of the Middle Kingdom, okay?). Who knows what role Amy will play in days to come.

Lily theorizes that Amy really came up with the plan to kidnap Nora to trick the Fiorentino family into sitting through the folk sing-along and make them suffer for mistreating her.

Notional: What if Amy becomes bitter after her defeat and starts to hate Cora and dedicates her life to bringing Cora down? She manages to embarrass Cora in front of everyone and get the class (except for Nora) to turn against her. Obviously she would do this by capitalizing on Cora's weaknesses: foul temper, propensity to throw tantrums, and stupidity. This causes the Fiorentino family to become the Leah family. Or maybe she doesn't do it purely to punish Cora; she has a larger plan: to make Cora become friends with her, by isolating her from the rest of the class! It only half-works, though, because Cora immediately goes to hang out with Nora, and Amy has to then try to break in on their little group, even though Nora knows that Amy is an evil mastermind. (And this should be written from Cora's point of view. She is, of course, oblivious to the liberty she takes by crawling to Nora when no one else will take her, and she also doesn't know that Nora knows that Amy is evil.)
**** Mikaela
The only one of Cora's friends not included in the Fiorentino family. A member of the soccer club. 
*** Other members of Class 6-1
**** Jill
A friend of Ranta's from her own class. A good runner, tall, lanky, straw-colored hair. Ranta describes her as built like a cheetah. 
** Insignificant Characters
*** Ms. Rutherford
The girls' PE teacher for the elementary school. Sort of a derelict; asked Lily, Nora, and Cora to clean out a hornet-infested shed in Book 1 "My rival!". 
*** Mr. Grayson
The teacher who made Cora read /Ulysses/ in fifth grade. Father of the Wooden Girls, Asha and Elma.
*** Mr. Woodbury
The boys' PE teacher. Not a child molester. (I.e. not based on Mr. Woodard.)
*** Mrs. Lovett
The dorm mother at Cora, Nora, and Ranta's dorm. Very strict.
* World

I think this is the same world as Neither Here Nor There. There are elves and Elder Ones (Arishil) in it too. And the world of Neither Here Nor There is the same world as Elf Balm. 

Strawberry Sunflower takes place in America somewhere (probably somewhere in California since NiThere doesn't use California). St. Galgani's Academy is a a school for spiritual-class nyvamna (whatever word we end up with; they're just 'Gifted' in Strawsun). 

Nora's old school was in the same world. I'm scrapping the alternate world idea.

** St. Galgani's Academy for the Gifted and Talented

*** Cleanliness
St. Galgani's has a dorm mother who helps the students with housekeeping, and she and the teachers and other faculty enforce a standard on the housekeeping and personal grooming, but unlike Hogwarts, there aren't any servants; the students have to maintain everything themselves, and they're assigned to clean the common areas on weekly crews, with a mixture of older and younger students at the elementary school.

In the middle school and high school, there's also a dorm mother for each dorm (boys and girls are separated at the other schools), but she doesn't help as much with the cleaning; older students are expected to do more of it themselves.
** Gifts
The Strawberry Sunflower world contains magic and psychic powers, but "gifts" are something different. Only gifts can spectacularly violate the laws of physics, for example. But each person just has one.
** List of plants in Lily's garden
*** Applegate Tree
A tree which grows apples that have "wormholes" that lead to other planets.
*** Calamomile
*** Chamorose
A pun on 'chamomile', 'rose', and 'morose'. A hybrid of chamomile and blue rose that induces a depressive and melancholic state when brewed into tea.
*** Choreographed Carrot
Carrots that love to dance. If you start dancing, they will follow along. Excellent backup dancers.
*** Crab-apple
Apples that grow crab legs and claws. They cut themselves down when the claws grow in and begin fighting for dominance, so they have to be harvested as soon as possible before they all squish each other.
*** Foxtail dart
Large foxtail which can be thrown as a dart. Used against Leah the Mad Makeover Queen in "The Cat Girl's Mafia".
*** Honeysquirtle
Grows large, tubular "gunblossoms". The stalks have air sacs near the base of the flower; if the air sac is squeezed, the blossom shoots out a large glob of sticky material. Used against Greta in "The Cat Girl's Mafia". Only good for one shot.
*** Peppy mint
A mint variant that can raise the spirits and increase energy. 
*** Shuriken thistle
Thistle grown into the shape of a ninja star. Used against Leah the Mad Cosmetologist in "The Cat Girl's Mafia".
*** Strawberry sunflower
A sunflower that grows strawberries in the center rather than normal sunflower seeds. 
*** Valerian /verité/
Valerian which can be made into a brew that immediately puts the drinker to sleep. While asleep, they will truthfully answer questions by sleeptalking. This is not, however, an unbeatable interrogation technique, because the drinker is only peripherally aware of the questions and will often misunderstand or provide too little information, or speak in an incoherent murmur. The brew itself is also called valerian /verité/.
