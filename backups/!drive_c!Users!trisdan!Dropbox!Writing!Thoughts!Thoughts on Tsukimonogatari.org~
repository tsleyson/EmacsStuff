* Thoughts on Tsukimonogatari
** December 21st 2013: 
This is the third-season novel all about Yotsugi, containing the story Yotsugi Doll. I read the first few chapters posted on Baka Tsuki, which fortunately didn't have any spoilers for Hitagi End. In fact, this novel seems to take place just after Hitagi End, since Koyomi mentions the incident where Nadeko became a snake god at the end of the year, as if the whole thing is over and done. 

The main reason I felt compelled to read it is that I was filled with the charitable spirit towards Yotsugi after her part in Shinobu Time, especially letting Mayoi-chan ride on her shoulders to surprise-kiss Koyomi and declare her love. The main reason I felt compelled to write about it is that the first three chapters are basically all about Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan.

After a ranty prologue where Koyomi talks about Yotsugi, we go into an even rantier first chapter where Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan come to wake Koyomi up, and while he tries not to wake up he thinks about how much he hates alarm clocks and why it might be that he hates them so much. He makes all sorts of totally unjustified puns to try and explain why he hates alarm clocks, and then engages in a battle of wits with his sisters as they try to wake him up. Koyomi mentions how he once bought an alarm clock, but Karen-chan smashed it with her fist of justice, saying they wouldn't let a machine take their jobs (she's like the John Henry of little sisters who wake up their brothers). Koyomi says they should rename themselves the Clock Sisters and the merchandising people should make a clock with Karen-chan as the minute hand and Tsukihi-chan as the hour hand (so their heights would be preserved) that tolls the hour with the voices of Kitamura-san and Iguchi-san. Karen-chan reminds him that the anime is already over (I guess Nisio-san didn't realize that they would make an anime of the second season, just like he thought it was okay for Tsukihi-chan to strip in Neko Black and justify it by saying they would never adapt the sixth novel to anime.)

Koyomi mentions that the next day is Valentine's Day and asks if they've started on their chocolates for him. Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan both say it's pathetic to so casually expect chocolate from your sisters and Tsukihi-chan speculates that if he wants sister chocolate so badly, he must not really have a girlfriend and Hitagi is an actress that he hired for 1000 yen an hour to play his girlfriend. Apparently they've both been hanging out with Hitagi and getting along well recently, which Koyomi speculates is due to the similarity between her and Tsukihi-chan's personalities, and Koyomi thinks that they're going to give Hitagi chocolate and push some kind of yuri agenda. (Tsukihi-chan says a BL agenda would be better. Karen-chan should introduce her to Suruga some time.)

With Koyomi firmly awake, Karen-chan goes off to run and asks him to run a bath for her since she'll be all sweaty when she gets back. Koyomi does so, following a short conversation where Tsukihi-chan gets mad at him for mentioning the breakup of the Fire Sisters and the farewell party with just him and a bunch of middle school girls, all while thinking about the future. He's now on break to study for his college entrance exam. He tells us that it was thanks to Hitagi and Tsubasa that he was able to get the necessary knowledge to have a shot at passing the exam, but it's thanks to Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan that he was able to get to school often enough to have the necessary attendance days to graduate. He's now worried about their futures; he thinks that Karen-chan is probably okay, but he's worried about Tsukihi-chan due to her personality and weird habits. (I'm wondering if he's actually worried about her because she's a kai; as we know, kai and those who've encountered kai tend to attract more kai, so chances are Tsukihi-chan will find out about kai at some point, being one herself. Up to now he's been around to protect her, along with Shinobu, but he's going to college and presumably Shinobu is going with him, so they won't be around to look after her.) 

Koyomi decides that taking a bath sounds nice and justifies it by saying that he's making sure it's safe for Karen-chan, like those royal food testers, but for baths. He goes into the changing room and takes his shirt off, when Tsukihi-chan comes in half-naked, having stripped and thrown her clothes on the floor outside, which she apparently does a lot. Koyomi tells us that she gets sweaty easily and tends to bathe whenever she can. (Another shocking similarity between Tsukihi-chan and myself.)

Koyomi and Tsukihi-chan fight about who's going to take a bath first. Koyomi says in his narration that he doesn't mind letting her go first in principle (since she says her mind is already in the bath), but as the eldest it is his right by Japanese tradition to go first in bathing, and he doesn't want to set a precedent that will lose him that right, so he fights with her. Koyomi says she must defeat him, so Tsukihi-chan throws a bottle of shampoo at him and Koyomi says he meant to defeat him with words. They argue over who has the better claim to the first bath, knowing that time is against them since when Karen-chan gets back she will definitely have the best claim and also she can beat them both up. Tsukihi-chan says she has a compromise, which Koyomi thinks is impossible since bathing order is a zero-sum game, but Tsukihi-chan says they should go in together. 

And horribly, that is where Chapter 3 ends and no more is translated. I could totally read an entire book of stuff like this and probably summarize it all in great detail with pleasure, but I assume before long we go into Yotsugi's story. I'm kind of hoping, though, that this story will follow Tsukihi-chan a little more. It is called Tsukimonogatari, and Koyomi slightly foreshadowed it by mentioning how he was worried about her future. Yotsugi and Tsukihi-chan sort of have a connection since Yotsugi did try to kill her (for which I still haven't entirely forgiven her). Maybe this is where Tsukihi-chan finds out about kai (which she should, being one herself). Now that we know Nisio-san isn't against writing about Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan, since Nisemonogatari was his fanfic about them, there is some small hope. After all, Karen-chan's story kind of feels done, but there's a lot to Tsukihi-chan that's never been explored. Her story was left hanging. We know she's smart and figures out a lot of things about what's going on, so she must have some idea that something weird went on during the summer; there's no way she bought Koyomi's story about a truck hitting the house, even if she didn't remember exactly what happened. We've seen and heard many times that Tsukihi-chan likes to play her cards close to the vest (Tsubasa mentioned she seemed to be hiding something in Neko White, when Tsukihi-chan figured out that Koyomi's H-san was her; also, in Otori, Tsukihi-chan herself said to Nadeko that if Nadeko had decided to go after Koyomi, she might have just kept quiet and watched from the sidelines). So it might be that she remembers exactly what happened, knows something is strange about Koyomi, and chose not to say anything.

I will look forward to more of this novel (or an anime version) with great eagerness.

They did make an anime version!

I keep wondering how far they’re going to push it with Monogatari anime. It would be amazing if they would adapt all the novels up to the end into anime so I could see the final ending, since the novels are never going to all be translated. Even though the more recent anime versions haven’t been as brilliant as Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari, and Nekomonogatari Black, it’s still a unique story, and I have a pretty big emotional investment in these characters at this point, so I would probably watch them all unless they were only available on Blu-Ray sets from Aniplex USA and fansubs weren’t even an option. (Setting aside that I have no ability to watch Blu-Rays right now, Aniplex USA is just awful. I just finished Madoka and loved it, so I looked into getting it on DVD, but see my thoughts on Madoka for what I found. Even the $150 Blu-Ray only releases of Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari look like a good deal next to what they did with Madoka.)

Like Hanamonogatari and Nekomonogatari Black, Tsukimonogatari is split into episodes, but they were shown as one long broadcast and they’re also shown that way online. Tsukimonogatari is only available on Daisuki, another legal streaming site which is smaller than Crunchyroll, but it sometimes gets things earlier because it’s directly connected to the Japanese distributors in some way. So far I’m far from impressed with Daisuki. I discovered that one of my Firefox plugins, Adblock Plus, is capable of blocking the ads in streaming videos, and all this time it had been blocking the ads in Crunchyroll videos so that there’s just a black screen for a second whenever an ad comes up. Daisuki and some other sites just refuse to load if you have Adblock Plus, so I had to disable it and watch commercials for tourism in Corpus Christi, Texas. That in itself wouldn’t have been that terrible, but the Daisuki player is finicky and buggy overall. Sometimes when it loads, the subtitle timing is totally off, so each line of dialogue is translated three lines later. You have to reload to fix this. During playback, the video will randomly pause. You have to click on the tracker in the timeline, which turns the pause button into a play button, then click the play button to get it going again. I know this has nothing to do with my network signal because I’m watching from exactly the same spot I watch Crunchyroll from, in my bed, and because when I click the play button it restarts right away and will play with no problems for five to ten minutes before it does it again. Also, the Daisuki player doesn’t save your spot; every time you load a video, it starts over from the beginning, similar to the buggy and frustrating Crunchyroll Android app. This is a big problem when you have five episodes squashed together and you’re trying to watch one episode at a time. With Hanamonogatari on Crunchyroll, I could just reload the page the next day and the video would start from where I left off. With Daisuki, I have to screw around finding where I was, which, like the Crunchyroll player, has a tendency to freeze the video and necessitate a reload.

But enough about the various dissatisfactions; what about the show itself? I’ve watched two episodes, and while it hasn’t totally brought back the glory days, it’s definitely more Nise than Hana, with the same silly tone, bizarre conversations, and awesome fan service, lacking the darkness of Second Season or the mystery of Hanamonogatari. The visual style has changed again, with interstitial cards that remind me of those postcards with a bunch of stamps on them, probably meant to parallel Yotsugi’s flamboyant, colorful wardrobe. There’s an opening in the same visual style, where Saori Hayami sings in her flat Yotsugi voice. The song kind of sounds like Japanese elevator music with a techno underpinning. (In other words, everything is as weird as ever.)

Although they cut some bits from that juicy scene with Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan, the remainder is still a pretty good scene, and contains some in-jokes that were already all over Anime and Manga SE before I even realized the show was out. The biggest is the scene where Koyomi talks about the Fire Sisters breakup party with him and a bunch of middle school girls; for like one second, a picture flashes up with a shadowy Koyomi being cuddled up to by shadowy middle school girls. If you pause and look, the Madoka girls are clearly among them. (You can see the outlines of Madoka’s distinctive twin tails and of Kyouko’s distinctive ponytail, and that identification made, it’s pretty easy to see that the girl with long hair next to Madoka is Homura, and the girl with short hair next to Kyouko is Sayaka. Madoka doesn’t seem to be into Koyomi, either, and shrinks towards Homura instead.) Tsukihi-chan also tells Koyomi that Nadeko came home, that she’s currently in the hospital, and that he should go visit her. Koyomi thinks that his shame is such that he can never see Nadeko again.

Once Koyomi and Tsukihi-chan get in the bath, the action really starts (even though the novel was only translated up to the scene where Tsukihi-chan proposes going into the bath together, I think we all knew there was no way Koyomi was just going to decide it was too awkward and leave). Koyomi and Tsukihi-chan are constantly getting naked together and admiring each other’s bodies, and they do so in the bath as they sit side by side and wash themselves, doing all sorts of juicy poses. (Mostly it’s Tsukihi-chan doing juicy poses, but if there are any women actually still watching this show, Koyomi’s muscles feature prominently in one bit, where Tsukihi-chan points out that he has an eight-pack and Koyomi tells her not to count them.) For some reason, Tsukihi-chan proposes that rather than washing themselves side by side, they should wash each other, so she washes Koyomi. When she washes his hair, she spikes it up to look like Astro Boy and calls him “Tetsuwan Oniichan”. Koyomi then washes Tsukihi-chan, even scrubbing her breasts. (There’s a great GIF of this online.) When he rinses her hair out, he ends up tossing a full pan of water in her face, and for some reason Tsukihi-chan enjoys this and adorably cries out for him to do it again, which he does.

At this point, though, Koyomi realizes that he has no reflection in the mirror. The mirror was behind them, so Tsukihi-chan didn’t notice (or so we think—I suspect and hope that we’ll later find she did notice). Koyomi panics, and in his panic to ensure Tsukihi-chan doesn’t notice, ends up with both of them on their knees, her head in his hands. Tsukihi-chan misinterprets this and, saying it’s all right, closes her eyes and puckers her lips for a kiss. At that moment, Karen-chan comes in and finds them naked together in the bath, apparently about to make out.

(Karen-chan has started to grow her side ponytail back. It’s longer than the alternate reality side ponytail posited in the doujinshi Koyomi Sandwich, but still much shorter than her original side ponytail. Tsukihi-chan has super-long hair, all the way down to her thighs, and for some reason she’s started saying “Nya” as an expression of surprise or confusion. I swear, the story keeps getting thinner, but Tsukihi-chan just keeps getting more adorable.)

Koyomi goes back to his room and summons Shinobu to talk about his problem. Shinobu doesn’t want to come out, so he lies that he has Mr. Donuts golden chocolate donuts. After taking his licks for lying, Shinobu tells him that only full vampires should lack reflections, adding that she was so powerful, she actually had a reflection. (Like Medaka Box’s Hinokage, who was so powerful that everyone forgot he existed. Nisio Isin has a weird idea of what happens when you become super-powerful.) She says this is beyond her knowledge, and Koyomi needs help from an expert in immortal kaii, like Yozuru Kagenui. Koyomi has no idea how to contact her, so Shinobu suggests Izuko Gaen; just as she says that, Koyomi receives a text from Gaen telling him where to meet Yozuru.

Tsukihi-chan comes in, mad that Koyomi bailed and left her to face Karen-chan’s punishment alone. (This scene parallels the toothbrushing scene in a lot of ways—in that instance, Tsukihi-chan came in and found Karen-chan and Koyomi apparently about to make out, got angry, and punished them by nearly killing them with awls. Here, Karen-chan is the one who gets angry and apparently beats up Tsukihi-chan as punishment, since Tsukihi-chan complains about Koyomi leaving her to take all the beatinga alone.) Tsukihi-chan demands an apology. Koyomi says he has a request to make of her that she must do, and if she’ll do it, an apology is nothing. He wants her to go to Suruga’s house with Karen-chan and spend the night. (He even hugs her, to her confusion.) Later, he thinks that he really did Suruga a favor by sending his two cute sisters to spend the night at her house.

That accomplished, Koyomi goes that evening to meet Yozuru. He and Shinobu find Yotsugi in a crane game machine. The arm is too weak to grab her, but he manages to knock her over to the chute after about twelve tries. 

Yozuru tells Koyomi that he’s becoming a vampire because he’s been using his vampiric powers too often and his body got used to it. He used his powers almost every day during the period when Nadeko was a god, because he kept going to the shrine to try and talk to her, and she would get angry and stab him. Koyomi asks if there’s some way to reverse it, and Yotsugi tells him there is no way.

Yozuru recommends that he minimize his use of vampiric power and stop going after kaii. Koyomi asks why she chose to specialize in immortal kaii, and Yozuru gives him a winding non-answer in which she mentions that all kaii are in some sense dead already. She also says there’s one other specialist who only hunts immortal kaii, named Tadatsuru Teori, but unlike Yozuru, who just wants to kill them, Tadatsuru has a sense of aesthetics and finds them somehow artistic and perfect.

Izuko contacts Yozuru and notifies her that Karen-chan, Tsukihi-chan, and Suruga have been kidnapped from Suruga’s house. She instructs Yozuru to help him, so Yozuru loans him Yotsugi so they can go to the house and check things out. Yotsugi uses Unlimited Rulebook to get them there, and she, Koyomi, and Shinobu investigate, finding an empty house and a weird trick paper crane in Suruga’s room, which unfolds into a chain of colored cranes. They bring this back to Yozuru, who proclaims it the work of Tadatsuru Teori. She unfolds the paper cranes and finds that he wrote “Kitashirahebi Shrine” on one of them, with no time given.

Due to his artistic nature, Yozuru says that Tadatsuru definitely hasn’t killed anyone yet. She says she’ll continue to loan him Yotsugi and come along later to help, since Izuko asked her to help him. Yotsugi brings them to the foot of the mountain so they won’t be seen. At the foot of the mountain, they encounter Ougi.

I almost stopped writing after the bath scene, because the parts with Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan are the only ones I care about. (Especially Tsukihi-chan. She’s platinum adorable with her long hair and new habit of saying “Nya”.) I don’t really have anything to say about the rest of the material, except that it was funny and weird like Monogatari should be, and I was glad to see it get back on track a little after Hanamonogatari. The part where Yotsugi was in the crane game machine was both funny and typically symbolic, since the title is “Yotsugi Doll” and she was in the machine with the other dolls. Yotsugi is a pretty weird character herself anyway. She dresses weird, and every time she appears she has some weird new catchphrase (“I said, with a posed look” in Tsukihi Phoenix, “Peace peace” in Hitagi End, and now “Yay yay”. I liked “peace peace” the best, especially when Kaiki said it was really annoying and threatened her to make her stop).
