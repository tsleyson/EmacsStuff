  Have the threads go and put their answers on the answers queue until
  the task queue is empty.
  Have the manager queue wait while the task queue is not empty.
  When the task queue is empty, wake up the manager. Have it check the
  answers queue. If there's anything in it, the smallest should be in
  it. If the answers queue is empty, the manager refills the task
  queue and lets everyone else go ahead.
