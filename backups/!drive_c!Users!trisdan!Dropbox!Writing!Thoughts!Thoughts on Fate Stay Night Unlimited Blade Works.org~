* Thoughts on Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works <2014-10-24 Fri>
** Prologue <2014-10-24 Fri>
I decided to try watching this and see if I could get through it before I was in any danger of playing the visual novel Unlimited Blade Works. It looks like that won't happen, so I'll have to stop playing the visual novel at some point, because it would totally ruin this.

The first episode covers the prologue of the visual novel, where Rin summons Archer and then later saves Shirou from death, then goes back to save him, meeting Saber. Having played the visual novel kind of ruined it. First of all, I knew what was going to happen (that's a general thing for me with the Fate franchise, because I loved it so much after I saw the 2006 anime, and I assumed there would be no more and I would never read the visual novel, so I looked up all kinds of spoilers online). But also, the anime cuts a lot of dialogue from the scenes, and of course we lose the narration. Even though most of this lost dialogue wasn't really useful or necessary in the visual novel, my mind kept on filling it in, and noticing the differences, which was pretty annoying. The only losses I felt were really significant were the ones in Rin's scenes with Sakura. We still got the gist of those scenes, that Rin likes Sakura (and of course, this series assumes you've seen Fate/Zero, and so know they're sisters already), but they were fuller in the visual novel. Mitsuzuri's scene gets cut to almost nothing, but she's such a minor character that it doesn't really matter, and the anime version of the scene actually makes more sense: Rin doesn't come into the archery dojo, have tea, then say she has no interest in watching practice and leave. Instead, she stands in the doorway for a minute, then leaves, saying a friendly word to Sakura on her way out (but not as friendly as I wanted it to be). The later scene where she helps Sakura carry some paper to Kuzuki was more like it, although it was a little short And when Rin saves Shirou's life, she makes it clear that she's doing so for Sakura's sake, saying "She's going to be devastated". (At any rate, it's clear if you know that Rin and Sakura are sisters and that Sakura likes Shirou. Most of the audience probably does, because most of them have probably seen Fate/Zero and many of them have probably seen either the visual novel or the Deen anime.)

So I really don't want to play the visual novel Unlimited Blade Works before I finish the anime,  but it's going to take forever to finish the anime since it's on right now and so coming out one week at a time, with a delay so Crunchyroll can give its premium viewers something special. 

The anime does add some nice bonuses to the visual novel story. For one thing, the animation is even more amazing than Fate/Zero. I especially liked the crumbling, ivy-covered Tousaka manor, fallen into disrepair after years of having Rin and her crippled mother, and later just Rin, as its only occupants. In the visual novel, since Rin was the viewpoint character, we couldn't see her, but in the anime she makes all kinds of cute expressions that get across what was expressed in narration in the visual novel. Also, we get to see her in her nightgown, which we haven't yet in the visual novel. And flashback Tokiomi actually looks like Fate/Zero Tokiomi; in fact, the first scene is Rin dreaming about the last time she ever saw her father, in Fate/Zero just before he was killed by Kirei, when he gave her the magic book in Hebrew. (That's more of a bonus over the Deen anime, though.) Also, the fight scene between Lancer and Archer is really cool.  The fight scenes might be even better than Fate/Zero. 

I also have high hopes for the story going forward. The Fate storyline was very shounen-like in a lot of ways. The way it shapes up is actually something of a disappointment in retrospect, because the story starts with such a dark feeling, but the Fate story basically lets everything go Shirou's way, with enemies becoming allies, magical super-weapons appearing at the last minute when they're needed, and truth and justice conquering all. Everyone says Heaven's Feel is the darkest story, and Unlimited Blade Works is supposed to be intermediate in darkness between Fate and Heaven's Feel. Fate/Zero was super-dark, probably closer to Heaven's Feel, but Unlimited Blade Works ought to at least approach it in darkness. (Lancer's defeat and Kariya's final few episodes were some of the darkest damned things I've ever seen in an anime, even including Death Note, and the older anime like Akira that tried hard to be dark.) 
** Episode 1 <2014-10-25 Sat>
This episode covers Shirou's side of the prologue, just as we saw in the visual novel. Like the prologue, even though some dialogue is cut, nothing we lose actually feels that significant; most of the losses are more than acceptable. 

There's also some material here that wasn't in the Fate route of the visual novel. There's a scene where Sakura notices a strange bruise on Shirou's arm, similar to the one he notices a bit earlier on her arm (yes, that scene is in the anime). The scene where Shinji gets Shirou to clean the dojo is also different—Shirou accuses Shinji of hitting Sakura, which Shinji denies, forcing Shirou to apologize. As atonement, he makes Shirou clean the archery dojo. 

As I mentioned in the file on the visual novel, the difference between this and the Deen anime is that when the Ufotable anime cuts something, it's never something vital to establish character or atmosphere. Some details are not as clear, like how Sakura came to be doing housework for Shirou or why Shinji is angry at Shirou (although we know that Shirou knows that Shinji hits Sakura, and we are told that  Shinji drove Shirou out of the archery club, so that definitely explains the animosity much more than it was in the Deen anime). There might be some details we don't get, but there's always enough there that we get the same impression we did in the visual novel. The Deen anime cut so much that it actually became illogical, explicable only by utter stupidity on the part of someone (usually Shirou). 

This episode is also an hour long. I can't tell if the whole series is going to be like this or not, but Fate/Stay Night is one of the few anime I know of that could actually benefit from doing hour-long episodes, both because there's so much story and because the story is so contiguous and hard to split into episodes. You can split it up by day from the visual novel, but that's usually far too much material for a single half-hour episode. And even then, it's very contiguous. So it would be cool if we had hour-long episodes. 
** Episode 2 <2014-10-26 Sun>
Not much happens in this episode; it just covers Shirou's visit to the Kotomine Church and ends with them running into Berserker as they leave. There are a few more differences with the Fate route of the visual novel, though: Archer isn' t injured by Saber, and instead accompanies them to the church; later, when the group is on the way back, Archer comes out and tells Rin she ought to kill an easily defeatable enemy who's right in front of her. We also get to see all of Rin's cute expressions and the adorable sight of her rolling around on the floor with her butt in the air as she regrets that Saber was summoned by Shirou instead of her. Rin tells Archer she's not killing Shirou because she feels indebted to him since he used a Command Spell to stop Saber from killing her, and Shirou comments that she's actually a good person and he likes people like her, which throws her off.

The opening song is kind of interesting. It's within spec for a Fate show, but it's a little different from the epic, operatic songs from Fate/Zero. It's a little more like the songs from the Deen anime (at least one of which was also in the visual novel), but it's more upbeat, and is performed by meg rock, who also did all the openings for Bakemonogatari.
** Episode 3 <2014-11-02 Sun>
This plays out very differently from the first anime and the Fate route in the visual novel. Illya attacks and Saber goes into battle just like in the Fate route, but rather than stand back and watch Saber, Rin dispatches Archer to help. Archer goes to a roof far away and shoots Berserker with his arrows, supporting Saber, but they have no effect. Saber takes the battle away, to a graveyard, where she can get cover from Berserker. She manages to score several good cuts on him, but he never goes down. Meanwhile, Rin confronts Illya in the woods and they have a magical duel, but Illya is able to overcome Rin, who is only saved when Archer shoots at Illya and destroys her hair familiars. (She has the same magic as Iri, or I guess out of universe, Iri has the same magic as Illya. By the way, I think it’s funny that the Tousaka magic is based on pretty jewels, and the Einzbern magic is based on alchemy and pretty doves, but the Matou magic is based on corpses and gross worms and maggots and giant mosquitos. Gen Urobuchi even said in an interview that he doubts Aoi would have been charmed into marrying Kariya Matou if he’d brought her back to his gross worm pit.)

Shirou arrives and gathers up Rin, bringing her to witness the final battle of Saber and Berserker. Saber is amazed at how agile Berserker is and what sword skills he has, thinking he must be a hero of great renown. She tries to finish him off using Excalibur, although it’s not the final giant beam attack, because she doesn’t yell the name; she does shoot off the wind that keeps it invisible, then stab Berserker with the golden blade. He disintegrates, but isn’t finished off. Archer uses his Noble Phantasm and shoots an arrow that makes a giant explosion, keeping Berserker crippled enough that Shirou and Saber are able to escape. 

Illya says she didn’t care about Rin at all, but now she’s interested in Archer and she’ll let them live for now. Shirou collapses, injured.

This scenario was interestingly different from the Fate route, but it also makes a lot more sense in various ways. It makes sense that Rin would have Archer join the battle and provide support rather than hold him back and rely on Saber. (Although I guess she didn’t do that in Fate because he was at her house, injured, and she only had one Command Seal left, whereas here he was never injured and has been with her the whole time.) Saber’s actions also make more sense, as does Rin’s decision to go after Illya, and even though it’s foolish of Shirou to run into the battle, the way he does it is much less stupid than it was in Fate. The battle was amazingly animated, too. It was pretty shocking to see Berserker moving around like a ballerina and dueling with Saber instead of just standing there and relying on his size and thick skin, but it’s consistent with his identity as Heracles, a great swordsman and all-around warrior. (Though in the myths, he did often favor wrestling and clubs, so it’s not inconsistent for him to be a giant monster either.) I just wish I didn’t have to wait a week between episodes. That really ruins my groove, man. One episode a day is about perfect; it lets me absorb the story without leaving me time to forget anything or lose interest in a show. At this rate, I might lose interest in the show before it’s done, and that would be terrible.
** Episodes 4 and 5 <2014-11-19 Wed>
Unlimited Blade Works hasn’t yet been as cool as Fate/Zero when it comes to plot and character, but it is a lot cooler than the 2006 anime, which was actually pretty cool in a lot of ways, even if Shirou was a complete idiot, even more so than in the visual novel.

In Episode 4, Rin saves Shirou from his wounds after the battle (no self-healing in this route) and tells him they’re done and they’re now enemies. Saber explains that she can’t reveal her true name to Shirou because there are magi who can read minds that might be able to get it out of him, since he has no defense. 

Taiga calls Shirou to bring her lunch at archery practice, and Shirou complies, but Saber won’t let him go alone, so she comes along. She waits outside the dojo while Ayako receives the lunch, but Ayako notices her and asks who she is. Shirou tells her Saber is an old friend of Kiritsugu’s who’s boarding with him for now.

Saber leaves on her own and ends up running into Kuzuki. She and Kuzuki trade glares until Shirou arrives and apologizes for having outside people in the school. He ends up giving Saber a tour of the school and runs into Taiga and Sakura on their way home. He explains things to Taiga and Sakura and they seem to take it well, except later that night, when Shirou asks Taiga to bring Sakura home, she says she can’t, because she’s going to be staying there, and she invites Sakura to do the same.

In Episode 5, Rin is on the trail of Caster, who’s been sucking people dry to augment her own mana. (This translation doesn’t say anything about “stealing souls”, and as I always thought that was kind of cheesy, I’ll stick with it.) Archer chastizes her for going after a difficult enemy when there’s a sitting duck in front of her, and Rin says if Shirou is still screwing off the next time they meet, she’ll kill him.

Shirou is still screwing off, so Rin attacks him. This was also in the 2006 anime, but it made a lot more sense here because they haven’t already made an alliance, and Rin, although she clearly doesn’t want to kill him, still thinks it might be necessary. Also, it seems pretty obvious that she pulls her punches in this version, missing several perfect chances to kill or maim Shirou, and she never summons Archer, who could have made short work of Shirou if she really wanted to kill him. By contrast, the 2006 anime makes her look merely incompetent in this fight. She still doesn’t thrash Shirou as bad as Lancer does, but it’s pretty clear that she’s capable of ending him if she wanted to, and that her internal ambivalence is preventing it.

As they’re fighting, Shirou notices a girl getting attacked outside and breezes past Rin to go to her. Rin follows, and they find that she’s been sucked dry and will die without help. Rin does what she can, while Shirou blocks Rider’s attack and goes into the forest to engage Rider. Afterward, Rin brings Shirou to her house to heal his wounds and proposes an alliance, to which Shirou agrees.

We see several hints about Shinji, too; Shinji is out of school, and Ayako has also been out of school, shortly after Shinji was seen arguing with her, implying that he attacked her and possibly killed her. (I think Unlimited Blade Works is cold-blooded enough to kill off Ayako. Maybe not Taiga, but yes Ayako.)

I wonder whose house they’re going to live in in this route. Is Rin still going to move into Shirou’s house, or is Shirou going to move into her house? Yes, those are the stupid things that concern me. 
** Episode 6 <2014-12-03 Wed>
Archer walks Shirou home, but Shirou says Archer can leave because he doesn’t want to be guarded by someone who wants to kill him. Archer compliments him for figuring that out (he’s not nearly as dumb as he was in the Deen anime) and tells Shirou how Servants don’t all fight for the Grail, and in fact many of them would just as soon be left alone, but they’re forced to come back by Masters.

Saber, of course, is angry at him for not consulting her on the alliance matter, but not as much as she might be, and she gets him to train with her. Shirou invites Sakura to keep staying over, since it’s not safe for her to walk home at night, an offer which Sakura gladly accepts. Taiga tells him that Ayako was found and although she’s in bad shape, she’s not dead. 

Rin and Shirou go around the school erasing the sigils for Shinji’s barrier, but Shinji confronts Shirou afterward and reveals that he’s a Master and the barrier was his insurance. He asks Shirou to team up with him, but Shirou refuses, so Shinji says he can’t have Sakura staying at Shirou’s house if they’re going to be enemies, and Shirou agrees to send her home. Shinji claims that Rider attacking that girl was something she did on her own and that he can’t control her, although Shirou seems suspicious, and mentions that Shinji was the last person Ayako talked to before she disappeared. Shinji laughs and says it was just brainless chitchat and nothing to worry about.

That night after training with Saber, Shirou goes to the shed to work on his magic. Saber comes in and watches, but he screws up, and Saber says she can feel that he’s nervous around her and leaves. Later, as Shirou is asleep, threads creep in through the window and grab him, dragging him out to Ryudou Temple, where he wakes up and finds Caster standing over him. Caster explains how she’s been behind all the attacks and how she’s now going to take all his mana, until a rain of arrows comes down and severs the threads, and Archer confronts Caster. Caster is nonplussed that a Servant breached her barrier. Meanwhile, Saber is on her way and comes to the stairs, where she confronts Assassin.

This was mostly a glue episode, and the conversation with Shinji felt oddly rushed, but I expect the next episode to be pretty damned cool. And I don’t have to wait to see it, because I fell behind a little, so I have one more episode available.
** Episodes 7-10, <2014-12-28 Sun>
I fell behind on writing about the episodes and now here we are. 

Unlimited Blade Works is pretty cool, but it feels kind of rushed and not as well-planned as Fate/Zero. It’s probably because it adapts a sprawling visual novel plotline where Fate/Zero was a novel, so it could be more focused and purposeful. Or maybe Urobuchi is just a better writer than Nasu. (What? Nasu is good at making characters and magical systems and building a world, but his plot writing is straight from the overly dramatic, semi-coherent school of chuunibyou writing. Urobuchi is just an amazing plot writer, almost like George R.R. Martin. And Nasu is kind of like J.R.R. Tolkien. So Fate/Zero was like a fusion of LotR and ASOIAF. That’s pretty hard to beat.)

As Saber clashes with Assassin on the steps of Ryuudou Temple, Archer manages to sneak in and face Caster. He and Caster fight, with Caster astonished at his power. Caster offers to team up with him and Shirou and pool their power to take out Berserker, but Shirou absolutely refuses. Archer forces Caster to retreat, but tells Shirou that Caster’s plan was a good way to end the Holy Grail War with less bloodshed: by gathering mana from bystanders and walloping Berserker, possibly killing a few, but preventing greater destruction. Shirou thinks back to the fire that killed his parents, but says he can’t get behind that, so Archer cuts him open with Kanshou and Bakuya.

Archer carries Shirou out, interrupting Saber’s fight with Assassin. Assassin allows Saber to leave with Shirou while he fights with Archer. Saber tends Shirou’s wounds, and later, Rin apologizes and tells Shirou she used a Command Spell to ensure that Archer won’t attack him as long as their alliance is going. Rin left Archer at home, since she’s mad at him.

After Rin and Shirou destroy several of the sigils for his barrier, Shinji attacks and activates Rider’s Bloodfort, enveloping the school in an evil mana-sucking field. As usual, he blames Shirou for destroying his sigils so he had to attack early in order to gain power and “defend himself”. Shirou uses a Command Seal to summon Saber to fight with them, but they find Rider nailed to the wall (killed by Caster) and Shinji a quivering mess. Shirou sends Shinji to the Kotomine Church, where Kirei tells him there’s a Servant in search of a Master. I thought he was going to give Shinji Lancer, his backup, but he instead gives Shinji Gilgamesh, his main man.

With Shinji defeated, Rin turns her attention to the other Master at the school, who she believes to be Caster’s Master and hence connected with Ryuudou Temple. She gets Shirou to ask Issei if he’s a Master; Shirou makes Issei strip and checks for an absence of Command Spells. Shirou also keeps sword training with Saber, who is surprised and happy when he shows off surprisingly good technique, but gets miffed when she hears that he was copying Archer’s technique that he saw the other night, rather than learning from her. We see Shirou a few times holding two kendou shinai like Archer’s falchions and thinking about Archer’s technique and how skilled and beautiful it was.

Shirou discovers that Kuzuki, Rin’s homeroom teacher, is living at Ryuudou Temple and recently brought back a mysterious beauty who he claims is his fiancee. Rin is sure that Kuzuki is Caster’s Master and plans an attack on him. She leaves Archer at home since she’s worried about Archer and Caster getting the chance to talk again (Archer and Rin argued because Archer told her that having an alliance with good, but having an alliance with Shirou was stupid, and she ought to consider Caster’s offer. Rin angrily beat him down). Kuzuki summons Caster and laughs off Shirou’s suggestion that he’s under mind control, saying he doesn’t know what Caster is up to, but he doesn’t really care because he likes killing.

Saber takes on Caster while Shirou and Rin fight Kuzuki, who overpowers both of them and knocks Rin flat. Seeing Rin and Saber in trouble (but mostly Rin), Shirou manages to summon Projection magic and make his own versions of Kanshou and Bakuya, with which he fights off Kuzuki and gets them to retreat.

Afterwards, Shirou’s left side is numb, but he hides it from everyone and continues like nothing is wrong. But Saber notices that Shirou is breaking a lot of dishes. Rin comes over, angry that Shirou stood her up for their daily check-in meeting and left her in the Student Council room with Issei. She invites herself to lunch, after which they discuss what to do now and come to the conclusion that only massive and overwhelming force will suffice against Caster, who’s now barricaded herself in the temple along with Kuzuki. Rin invites herself to dinner, overcoming Taiga’s objections, then invites herself to stay over, having Archer bring her a bag.

Rin and Shirou have a talk in the courtyard about their reasons for practicing magic; Rin says although she kind of wants to live a normal life, she ultimately wouldn’t be practicing magic if she didn’t enjoy it; she says she’s a hedonist at heart, and her alliance with Shirou is even motivated by her interest in him. She asks if it’s the same for Shirou, and Shirou says he never really enjoyed it, but he viewed it as a tool that he could use to save others. Rin gets angry, but won’t tell Shirou why; she says she’s angry because he doesn’t know why she’s angry, and walks off in a huff.

Saber goes to the shed to confront Shirou about his numbness, and Shirou owns up. Archer comes in, and Saber is cagey, but Shirou tells her to let Archer come. Archer helps Shirou, saying in about three days the numbness should subside, and says he went through something similar. Archer and Shirou discuss philosophy and Archer says if you fight for an ideal, and not for something real, then you’ll only be able to save ideals, and not anything real.

The plot felt really hurried and most of the fight scenes were very anticlimactic, especially the Shinji fight scene. I think that was partially intentional; Unlimited Blade Works is a more serious exploration of ideals and reality than Fate, and as such, it lacks Fate’s explosive shounen anime fight scenes with satisfying endings where the truly evil die and the secretly good become friends with the hero.

Episode 10 was my favorite of these episodes—Rin character building! It seems that Shirou is starting to have a crush on Rin, noticing her nice legs in her tights and blushing. Their conversation in the snowy courtyard was interesting; we got to hear how Rin felt about her upbringing and how different she actually is from Tokiomi, who was all about fronts and duties and propriety. Tokiomi would have scoffed at a pathetic specimen like Shirou, and probably killed him (or left him to die on his own) rather than team up with him. Rin, though, has an intuition about people that Tokiomi didn’t have; not only does she sense something interesting in Shirou, behind the front of idiocy, she also realizes that he’s trustworthy and that trust can be just as important as raw power in an ally. Not only that, from the very beginning, she never liked or trusted Kirei. That, too, seems to be intuitive; she’s never hinted at a suspicion that Kirei was involved with her father’s death or her mother’s injuries, but nonetheless, she doesn’t like him, and recognizes that he’s a sadist.

From the way their conversation flowed, it almost seemed like when Rin asked if it was the same for Shirou, she was asking if he found her interesting the way she found him interesting; Shirou actually backtracked when he started talking about practicing magic to something she had said before. That could be why Rin was mad: because Shirou misunderstood the question she was actually asking, and also in some small way rejected her when she decided to be a little bit honest and put her feelings out there. 

I’m looking forward to the next episodes, not only to learn more about Rin and see more sides of my favorite character, but also because I’m interested in how the romance between her and Shirou will develop. The romance between Shirou and Saber, although often thwarted by Saber’s personality, was ultimately natural; they’re two people with the same values, the same goals, and who are brought closer together by necessity, in order to survive. But Rin and Shirou are rather different; Rin is subtle, devious, and, as she says, hedonistic, where Shirou is straightforward, unsophisticated, and self-sacrificing to a fault. That could be why Rin was interested in him: their differences attracted her. As they get closer, I can see them developing a respect for each other; Rin learns more about Shirou’s true depths, about the amount of thought he puts into his beliefs, and Shirou grows to admire Rin’s cunning and skill, as well as come to know her true kindness. Seeing that turn into romance will be interesting.
