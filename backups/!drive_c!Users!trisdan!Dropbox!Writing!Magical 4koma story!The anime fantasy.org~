In my fantasy anime of Strawberry Sunflower, this would be the cast:

Nora: Kana Hanazawa (with her adorable Kobato Hanato voice)

Lily: Sayaka Oohara (she's based on Alicia-san) or Yui Horie (with her Tsubasa voice) or Minako Kotobuki (Mugi-chan!)

Cora: Rie Kugimiya or Kana Asumi or Yuka Iguchi or Ryo Hirohashi (with Kyo voice)

Ranta: Chiwa Saito (with her Aika voice) or Saori Hayami or Kanae Ito

Miss Hanover: Ayako Kawasumi (with Mahoro voice) or Yui Horie

I want to write characters that could be voiced by Ai Nonaka and Ayana Taketatsu. (Akari, maybe, could be voiced by Ai Nonaka.) 

The first ending song would be done by Marble and would be like the endings of Hidamari Sketch (especially "Ryuusei Record"). The second ending would be Kana Hanazawa's "Too Late for Chocolate". The opening would be similar musically to "Jumping", the opening of Kin-Iro Mosaic.
