# June 2 Questions
## Why can't science *alone* tell us how to make reasonable judgments about how we should respond to climate change?
The issue of climate change encompasses questions which are not purely scientific. Some are metascientific, such as how climate scientists arrived at their conclusions on the basis of the evidence. Others concern human conduct and morals, such as how societies should react to climate change in the face of uncertainty, and how we should hear and consider conflicting interests and views.

## Why is mathematics excluded from the natural sciences?
The mode of discovery and nature of evidence in mathematics is very different from sciences such as chemistry, physics, earth science, and biology. Mathematics uses deductive reasoning from axioms within formal systems, and does not rely on observation or experiment; the natural sciences rely on inductive reasoning based upon observation and experiment.

## How is applied science different form pure science?
Applied science has the goal of creating or designing a physical object; metallurgy deals with creation of metals, engineering creates structures and machines, technology creates tools and processes for making and improving tools. Pure science has the goal of discovering general rules or laws of nature.

## Who is the the most influential natural philosopher before the Scientific Revolution?
Aristotle.

## What are the differences between a geocentric and heliocentric system?
In a geocentric system, the Earth is the center of the universe and everything else revolves around it. In a heliocentric system, the sun is the center and the stars and planets all revolve around it.

## What does Galileo mean by "the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics"?
Natural laws can often be described very precisely by mathematics. For instance, we can say that "gravity grows weaker the further one goes from the body exerting the gravitational pull", but the mathematical equation for gravitational pull on a body, G(Mm)/r^2, tells us exactly the rate at which the pull weakensâ€”as the square of the distance.

## What does the "institutional structure of science" refer to?
The structures that allow scientists to trust work done by other scientists which they have never met, without personally reproducing the experiment, such as accrediting organizations, peer-reviewed journals, and professional societies that set ethical standards.

## What are the four images of science?
  1. Science is a way of accumulating useful facts by observation. A
  scientist observes the natural world and makes inductive generalizations
  from these observations.
  2. Science is a creative act. Scientists begin from conjectures on the edge
  of current knowledge and investigate, continually reevaluating their
  hypotheses and the validity of their results. Sometimes this results in
  useful discoveries.
  3. Science is the epitome of rationality, the best way of using our
  minds to make sense of the world. There is a strong, definite causal
  link between evidence and hypotheses; because of this, theories with
  more evidence backing them, such as quantum mechanics and the germ theory
  of disease, can be depended upon more than less well-supported theories.
  4. The non-celebratory view; science is a human endeavour, and just as
  much affected by the people doing it as any human endeavour. Science is
  subject to the values, beliefs, prejudices, and expectations of its
  practitioners. Some go so far as to say that science never advances, but
  merely revolves; the doctrines are set out and followed until overthrown
  by a new order.

## What does "value-free" mean?
The authors state their intention to argue that scientists must be mindful of the social consequences of their work, especially its role in crafting policy. They set this against the traditional notion that science should be value-free, which apparently denotes objective, dispassionate inquiry in which scientists set aside their humanity where their work is concerned.

# Bill Nye vs. Marc Morano
Bill Nye the Science Guy and our supposedly unbiased host, Piers Morgan, debate climate change with crackpot Marc Morano, whose only apparent credential to doubt global warming is that he runs a website for people who doubt global warming (note: totally biased summary).

Morano cites several dubious "facts" supposedly from "peer-reviewed studies" but never mentions the inquirers in the studies. (For one thing, he claims there hasn't been a Category 3 or higher storm in the US since 1900, but Hurricane Katrina and Sandy were both Category 3 or higher.)

# Nicholaus Copernicus and the Heliocentric Model
Short history of the heliocentric model.

# Aristotle's Four Causes:
Hipsters use cookie-making to explain Aristotle's four causes, different ways to explain how something came to exist:
  1. Material cause: the materials from which something is formed. E.g.
  water, sugar, flour, peanut butter, oil, eggs, etc. came together, and
  that's why snickerdoodles exist.
  2. Formal cause: When the ingredients are combined according to the recipe,
  this causes snickerdoodles to exist.
  3. Efficient cause: Because Elizabeth (the girl in the video)
  performed the actions of mixing, measuring, shaping, baking, etc., the
  snickerdoodles came to exist.
  4. Final cause: The snickerdoodles came to exist so they could be eaten.
  Equivalently, we could say that since a desire for cookies existed,
  the cookies came to exist; the desire caused the cookies. The
  tautological, highly evasive cause.
