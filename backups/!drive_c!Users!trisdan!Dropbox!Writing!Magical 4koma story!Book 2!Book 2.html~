<h1 id="the-camping-trip-part-2.-by-ranta.">The camping trip, part 2. By Ranta.</h1>
<p>How are you? I’m Amaranta, but call me Ranta.</p>
<p>We’ve never spoken before, but the last time you heard about me, I was running off into the dark forest to save my friend Nora. We had gone camping with the geology club, but we got separated from our group and ended up lost in the forest. We tried to find the campsite, but we didn’t figure out how to read our map until it was already late in the afternoon. We didn’t think we had enough time to get there before dark, so we decided to spend the night in a grove of oak trees, whose tops had twisted into a little roof. But we ran into some bad luck when it turned out the grove was actually the front doorstep of two giant spiders, who chased us out into the night and came after us.</p>
<p>When we saw those giant spiders, huge, ugly things with hideous fangs, each the size of a pony, I knew we had to escape. If I had been alone, I could have easily gotten away with my Gift of Running, which lets me run further and faster than anyone. But I couldn’t have carried Nora with me, and she couldn’t have kept up. So I told her to hide while I distracted the spiders and lured them away. Then, after I had drawn the spiders away, she could start for the campsite. I’m not going to ask you to praise me for this, unlike Cora, my rival. All I did was try to save my friend. That’s not the sort of thing you should be praised for—it’s the sort of thing you should do without a second thought, as a matter of course. That’s what I think, anyway.</p>
<p>Running at night is hard, and that goes double in the forest. I couldn’t really see where I was going, since it was dark and the trees overhead were so thick that even the moonlight barely made it through. I also had to watch my feet and make sure I didn’t trip on any rocks, roots, or branches, or slip on any pine needles or any patches of loose dirt. I had a flashlight, but its beam only shined about ten feet ahead, and I was covering ten feet about every three seconds, so I only had a small window of time to check the ground in front of me and make sure I wasn’t about to go falling on my face and feed myself to the spiders.</p>
<p>I looked back every so often to make sure the spiders were still behind me, but not too far. If they fell back too far, they might give up and go back to the grove, and Nora might not be far enough away yet. I wanted them to think they could catch me. There was no way they could catch me—even if they never got tired, I could run so far away that it would take them days to get there at the speed they were moving. Even Nora could probably outrun them if she were fully rested, but we’d been walking half the day and hadn’t gotten any sleep.</p>
<p>I noticed myself pulling ahead, so I slowed down a little to let the spiders catch up. I was about to take off again when I heard a voice.</p>
<p>“Wait! Don’t run! We don’t want to hurt you!”</p>
<p>I stopped. There was no way that spider had just talked to me.</p>
<p>“Yes, please don’t run! We don’t want to hurt you. We only want to talk.”</p>
<p>I heard the leaves rustling under sixteen legs, and I turned my flashlight on the spiders, who had come to a stop about twenty feet away from me.</p>
<p>“Did you just talk?” I asked, feeling stupid for even thinking it.</p>
<p>“Yes, we did,” said one of the spiders. I didn’t actually see its mouth move—even its two huge fangs were still—but the voice unmistakably came from its direction. It was a woman’s voice, a hoarse and croaky voice like an old grandmother.</p>
<p>“We didn’t want to hurt you,” said the other spider, its voice also old and croaky. “I’m sorry we put such a scare into you.”</p>
<p>“Why did you chase me?” I asked. “What do you want?”</p>
<p>“We wanted to sell to you,” said the first spider. “We thought you were a customer.”</p>
<p>“A customer of what?”</p>
<p>“We weave fine clothes, sheets, and curtains out of silk,” said the spider. “If you please, I’m Doris and this is Phyllis. We’re the Weaving Spider Sisters.”</p>
<p>You might have found it hard to believe that two gigantic spiders could actually be harmless, silk-weaving old ladies, and I certainly did, so I asked them, “How do I know you’re telling the truth?”</p>
<p>The first spider, which had called itself Doris, took a sack from its back and tossed it to me. I opened the sack, and inside were shirts, sheets, nightgowns, and other clothes, all made from silk and expertly dyed. I rubbed the material of a beautiful crimson blouse between my fingers. It was the best silk I had ever seen, not that I was an expert in silk.</p>
<p>“Do you live inside the mountain?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. We deal with shopkeepers and traders, and they all know the grove is our signpost. We heard you outside and thought someone had come to do business.”</p>
<p>“We apologize for scaring you,” added the second spider, which had called itself Phyllis.</p>
<p>“If this is true, then maybe you can help me. I’m trying to find the campsite. Can you guide me there?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Doris.</p>
<p>“And my friend. I told her to hide, then make for the campsite. Is she safe in this forest?”</p>
<p>The two spiders shivered, and clattered their fangs, seeming disturbed. “What is it?” I asked.</p>
<p>“If your friend had stayed at the grove,” said Phyllis, “all would be well. Our third sister, Bea, is there, and would have made sure no harm befell her. But in the direction of the campsite, there lives a dangerous hermit. He traps any who wander that way, lures them to his cabin, and puts them into his machine to steal their water, leaving them dried out husks. Your friend may be in danger.”</p>
<p>I felt my blood chill once again. “Where is his cabin?” I asked.</p>
<p>“At the foot of the hill, thirty minutes’ walk from our grove, perhaps,” said Doris.</p>
<p>“I’m going for her. If you mean us well as you say, then come after me and help. I can make it worth your while.”</p>
<p>“You mean to say you’ll buy from us?” asked Doris.</p>
<p>“Better. My family owns Eufemia, the clothing store. If you help us, I can convince my parents to buy your silk and sell it in our stores. You could make a lot of money.”</p>
<p>Doris and Phyllis exchanged a look, although it was hard to tell what it meant, with them being spiders. “We’ll help you,” said Doris. “We don’t <em>need</em> repayment, mind you, but afterward, if you happen to feel at all grateful to us…”</p>
<p>I couldn’t really promise that my parents would buy their silk. After all, I’m just a kid. I’m not part of their business. Still, I said, “If you help me rescue my friend, I’ll talk to my parents for you. Your craftsmanship and material look first-rate, so I’m sure they’ll be happy to buy from you.”</p>
<p>I asked the spiders to follow me as quickly as they could, and I set off, now running at full speed.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Running through the forest at night at full speed is even more difficult, but I had to reach the cabin and make sure Nora wasn’t there. The spiders had said it was about a thirty minutes’ walk from the grove to the cabin, and I had been running from them for at least five minutes, but at full speed I could cover a mile in six minutes, and I made quick work of the distance, dodging and hopping between the branches and over the soft spots in the dirt.</p>
<p>I came to a log cabin at the foot of the hill, without windows, with a low thatched roof. I could see the flickering of a lantern or candle between the cracks in the logs, and I could hear the squeaking of rusted metal and an odd, muffled sound that might have been someone trying to scream through a gag.</p>
<p>I knocked on the door of the cabin, but there was no answer. I knocked again, harder this time. Still no answer. I tried turning the knob, but it was locked. I glanced at the hinges on the door. They weren’t held on with screws or nails; they were stuck in with wooden pegs, hammered through the holes straight into the ends of the logs.</p>
<p>I moved back about a hundred feet from the door. With my weight and strength, I would normally never be able to break through. But my Gift of Running was good for more than just beating Cora in the mile run. After all, the force of an object is based on its momentum, and the momentum is based on both the mass and the speed.</p>
<p>Speed was my kingdom.</p>
<p>I dug my feet into the ground and took off, throwing my legs under me so fast that I almost fell on my face. I managed to stay upright, moving so fast I was almost flying, pushing myself to go faster, faster, faster.</p>
<p>The door loomed ahead of me. I pushed off the ground with my feet, jumping into the air, and slammed the soles of both shoes into the door.</p>
<p>The door flew off its hinges and slammed into the wooden floor, me on top of it. I landed hard on my butt. My tailbone felt bruised, but otherwise I was fine.</p>
<p>Inside, the cabin was full of metal rods and black rubber hoses. The rods and hoses all twisted around each other in a complicated setup that led back down to Nora, strapped to a chair, with a band of leather around her mouth stopping her from making any sound. As soon as she saw me, she began struggling against her restraints, the metal chair creaking and squeaking and shaking.</p>
<p>The hermit, a stooped old man in a wooden mask, with a long white beard and long ragged robes, looked up from his panel of instruments and saw me. “Is the bottled water good?” he asked, advancing on me with a length of rope in his hands.</p>
<p>I jumped to my feet, ran at the hermit, and tried the same jump kick I had used against the door. My feet sank into his robes, through several layers of clothes, and the hermit stumbled back, unhurt. I hadn’t been able to gain enough speed to do any damage to him.</p>
<p>“Come after me!” I cried, trying to get up and run, but the hermit grabbed my ankle and coiled the rope around my leg. I kicked out at him, struggling to free myself, and managed to get to my feet.</p>
<p>The hermit threw the rope at me like a lasso, but I easily dodged it. I grabbed the end and yanked on it, trying to pull the hermit off balance. He yanked back, sending me stumbling forward.</p>
<p>I was too small to win in a tug of war match with the hermit; my only hope was to get him out in the open and use my speed to take him down. I waited for him to yank on the rope again, and I let go. The hermit lost his balance and fell backwards crashing into a bundle of black rubber hoses running this way and that between pipes.</p>
<p>I darted out the door back into the forest. I hoped the hermit wouldn’t have time to start the switch on the contraption had had Nora strapped into before he came after me.</p>
<p>He didn’t. He stumbled out the door, the rope still in his hands. “Is the bottled water good?!” he asked, yelling now into the darkness.</p>
<p>“The bottled water’s over here. Come and find out!” I called, and I trotted off towards the edge of the clearing. The hermit limped along after me. His right leg seemed to be hurt, so he couldn’t move very fast.</p>
<p>At the edge of the clearing, I turned around suddenly and started racing at the hermit at full speed, even faster than I had run at the door. My feet were taking huge chunks of dirt out of the ground and kicking it off behind me with each stride. My legs felt as if they were going to tear apart. I ran, ran, ran, ran—</p>
<p>The hermit threw the rope at me, but I dodged it, and then I bounded into the air, my feet ahead of me. I felt my shoes sink into the hermit’s many layers of clothing, and this time, it wasn’t enough to protect him.</p>
<p>The hermit and I toppled to the ground in a pile, me on top, him on the bottom. I grabbed the end of the rope that was still in his hand, jumped up, and ran into the cabin.</p>
<p>Nora looked relieved to see that I had come back in instead of the hermit. I undid the leather strap around her mouth and got to work untying her. “I’m sorry!” she wailed. “He made it sound like he knew how to find the campsite, and I was scared of the spiders, and wasn’t thinking straight…”</p>
<p>“It’s all right,” I said as I pulled out the last knot. “By the way, about the spiders…”</p>
<p>“Is the bottled water good?!” the hermit yelled suddenly, appearing at the door with the other end of the rope in his hand. I tensed up, ready to take Nora in my arms and run, but I didn’t have to.</p>
<p>“Really, Zeke, attacking a pair of dear little girls like these two? You ought to be ashamed of yourself!” came an old lady’s voice from behind the hermit.</p>
<p>“Dreadful, dreadful,” scolded another.</p>
<p>The spiders had finally arrived.</p>
<p>“The bottled water is good!” the hermit yelled, jumping at the spiders. But he and I were holding two ends of the same rope. I yanked on my end, pulling him off balance. Then one of the spiders—I couldn’t tell if it was Doris or Phyllis—reared up like a stallion and came down on top of the hermit, pinning him to the ground.</p>
<p>The other spider began to pull a string of silk out of her…ah, maybe I’d better not say. If you know where it comes from, you might be too grossed out to wear clothes made from it. And then my parents might be mad at me for convincing them to sell the clothes that Doris and Phyllis make in our stores.</p>
<p>So let’s just say that she got a string of silk from somewhere. Then she wrapped it around the hermit’s middle, gumming him up so he couldn’t move his arms at all. Then she got another string of silk from somewhere and gummed up his legs.</p>
<p>I felt Nora’s hands on my back. She was hiding behind me, her eyes as wide as a full moon, staring at the spiders. “Yeah, about the spiders,” I said, smiling a little. “They’re not so bad. In fact, they only chased us because they wanted to sell us clothes.”</p>
<p>Nora threw her arms around me and buried her face in my shoulder. We’re about the same height, so she had to bend down to do it. “Thank you so much for saving me!” she said.</p>
<p>“Of course. We’re friends, aren’t we?” I said.</p>
<p>“A-are we?”</p>
<p>“We’re not?”</p>
<p>Nora shook her head. “No, of course we are! Um, you’re the second friend I’ve made at St. Galgani’s, after Lily.”</p>
<p>After the spiders had finished tying up the hermit, they walked us back to the campsite. I could tell that Nora was still nervous around them, and I couldn’t really blame her. Walking next to giant spiders is a little creepy, even when you know they won’t hurt you.</p>
<p>“You know, instead of thanking me for saving you,” I mentioned as we walked along behind the spiders, “you should be angry at me for getting us into this mess.”</p>
<p>“No, it wasn’t your fault, Ranta…I’m the one who dragged us over the cliff,” said Nora. I couldn’t see her face well, but I could hear the pine needles crunching under her hiking boots.</p>
<p>“Yes, but I’m the one who thought she could use a map and a compass, and really couldn’t. I’m sorry. I led us off into the forest, when really, we should have just stayed where we were and yelled for help.”</p>
<p>“No, you don’t need to apologize” said Nora. “I can’t be mad about that. We’re both safe, and we have a story to tell Lily and Francine when we get to the campsite.”</p>
<p>It took us about an hour to walk to the campsite. I knew we were there because we reached a ring of large trees that had obviously been planted on purpose to enclose a clearing, and I could see the light of campfires in the clearing. The spiders led us up to the edge of the ring of trees.</p>
<p>“Well, goodbye, dearies, and do try not to go off with old hermits in the future, there’s a good girl,” said one of them—Doris or Phyllis, I still couldn’t tell.</p>
<p>“Goodbye, Doris and Phyllis,” I said. “Thank you for your help. I’ll talk to my parents.”</p>
<p>“There’s a dear.”</p>
<p>With that, the spiders went off into the dark forest again, chattering amongst themselves in their high old woman voices. I led Nora into the ring of trees.</p>
<p>As we came into the light of the campfires, I saw her yawn. “I’m tired,” she said. “I can’t wait to get to bed.”</p>
<p>We found our group, camped out under an old fir tree. When we came up, Mrs. Julian, Lily, Francine, and Maria were still sitting around the fire, but the children had all been put to bed inside the tents.</p>
<p>Lily was the first to see us. “Nora! Ranta!” she cried out, and jumped to her feet, surprised and delighted to see us. She was so happy to see us that she seized Nora in a hug and then took me by the hands and spun me around in a quick and energetic waltz. “Thank goodness you’re here!”</p>
<p>We sat down around the fire, and Mrs. Julian cooked bacon and eggs and made tea for us on the campfire while Nora and I recounted what had happened.</p>
<p>When I came to the part about the giant spiders, Francine gasped in shock, but Maria said, “Come on, there’s no such thing as giant spiders.”</p>
<p>I was about to insist they were real, but Lily beat me to it. “Sure there is,” she said. “I’ve met some before. Bought some pajamas from them.”</p>
<p>“They sell pajamas?” said Maria, with a tone of disbelief.</p>
<p>“Sure, and their names were Doris and Phyllis,” said Lily.</p>
<p>“There’s no way you’re serious. Quit joking around,” said Maria.</p>
<p>All at once, Nora, Lily, and I started talking, insisting the spiders were real. “Fine, fine, the spiders are real,” said Maria after a few minutes, and I continued the story.</p>
<p>Then Nora told how she’d been taken captive by the hermit, and tied in a strange machine that the hermit had said would suck all the water out of her so he could taste it and find out whether it tasted good. “Okay, you almost had me with the spiders, but that’s just ridiculous,” said Maria. “A hermit who sucks the water out of you? Just stop. I think you two just wandered around the forest for a few hours and then decided it would be fun to tell us all a weird story about what happened.”</p>
<p>Nora and I both spoke at the same time again, insisting that wasn’t it, but Maria was having none of it this time. “Whatever. I’m going to bed. Great joke, you two, but I’m not falling for it.”</p>
<p>We finished the story, telling Francine, Lily, and Mrs. Julian about how I’d fought off the hermit, and how the spiders had come and tied him up and guided us to the campsite. When we’d finished, Lily clapped, and Francine joined her.</p>
<p>“Do you believe us, Mrs. Julian?” I asked, looking at her anxiously. I was worried that she would think the same as Maria, and punish us for running off and then telling lies.</p>
<p>Mrs. Julian smiled. “I’m glad you’re safe,” she said. “I think it’s time we all went bed. Lily, would you mind putting the food sack over against the tree? That way we won’t have any visits from bears or pine cats inside our tents.”</p>
<p>“We’d better finish this bacon,” I told Nora. “Pine cats love pork, so if there’s any left, they’ll be after it.”</p>
<p>After that, the rest of the trip passed uneventfully. The little kids ran around and screamed all day, while Maria yelled at them to stay in a group, and Mrs. Julian, Francine, and Lily studied the rock formations. Nora and I would listen to them talk about rocks until we couldn’t stand it anymore, and then we’d go off and enjoy the forest: the whisper of the breeze through the redwoods; the scent of the pines; the thick, white foam of the river as it crashed over the rocks. It was a beautiful place, and I decided that I wanted to come back sometime, with fewer people, and see it again.</p>
<p>After we got back to St. Galgani’s, I wrote my parents and asked if they would consider buying clothes from Doris and Phyllis, as I’d promised the spiders I would. But I didn’t think I could stand to wear the clothes myself, not after I’d seen where the silk came out of. I later asked Lily how she dealt with it when she wore the pajamas she’d bought from the spiders.</p>
<p>“It just doesn’t bother me,” she said.</p>
<p>“But surely you know where the silk comes from? What part of the spider makes the silk?” I said.</p>
<p>“Sure. It just doesn’t bother me,” she repeated.</p>
<p>That was the first sign I had that Lily is a little bit different. A little bit weird.</p>
<p>After all, it doesn’t bother her at all to wear clothes woven from silk that came out of a spider’s—eh, I’d better not say after all.</p>
<h1 id="coras-weekend.-by-nora.">Cora’s weekend. By Nora.</h1>
<p>How are you? It’s Nora again. Good to see you!</p>
<p>Lily, Ranta, and I got back from the camping trip on Sunday evening, just in time to have dinner in the dining hall. We chose a table together and talked about our trip as we ate.</p>
<p>Partway through our meal, a girl I didn’t know came up and sat with us as if it were the most natural thing in the world. She was a cat girl, like Cora, and she even had her hair tied in twin pigtails like Cora. But unlike Cora, her hair was deep, inky black, as if it had been dyed with Chinese calligraphy ink. Also, she wasn’t wearing glasses.</p>
<p>I didn’t mind if she sat with us, but I thought it was a little strange that Ranta and Lily didn’t stop talking to acknowledge her right away. Then I saw her scowling. Cora’s scowl.</p>
<p>It was Cora.</p>
<p>“Cora, what happened to your hair?” I asked, causing Lily and Ranta to stop recounting the pine cat we’d seen above the waterfall that morning, and look around at Cora and me.</p>
<p>“Don’t ask,” Cora growled.</p>
<p>“Looks like your weekend didn’t go so well,” said Ranta.</p>
<p>“And what happened to your glasses?” I asked. “Aren’t you almost blind without them?”</p>
<p>“Just—just don’t ask,” Cora said again. “It sounds like you three had fun on your camping trip. Just—just talk about that for a while.”</p>
<p>Lily and Ranta and I went on talking about the camping trip while Cora scowled at her dinner. Every so often, I would sneak a look at her. I was trying to see if there was anything else different about her, anything that might give me a clue about what had happened to her, but I didn’t see anything different. She scowled just like always, though she was being a little quieter than usual and hadn’t yet yelled at me or started a fight with Ranta. She just sat, scowling and listening as we talked, eating her chicken Parmesan and scowling at it, scowling at her garlic bread, scowling at her glass of iced tea, and scowling at me whenever she caught me looking at her.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The next morning, before class, I decided I would ask Cora what had happened. Maybe she hadn’t wanted to say in front of Ranta and Lily. Maybe she was afraid Ranta would make fun of her, or Lily would think she wasn’t cool. I was pretty sure Lily didn’t think she was cool to begin with, but Cora seemed to think there was a chance that Lily did, and she didn’t want to ruin it by admitting that she’d done something embarrassing.</p>
<p>Even if Cora didn’t want to tell me, I was so curious to know that I had to try asking. When I saw her come into the classroom, I got up and walked up the row towards her desk. She was wearing her glasses again, but her hair was still black.</p>
<p>As I came closer, I began to speak. “Um, C-Cora? Would you t-tell me what h-happened over the week—” I began, but stopped talking when one of the other girls—her name was Willow, I was pretty sure—grabbed me by the wrist as I passed by.</p>
<p>“Hey, new girl,” said Willow. “What do you think you’re doing, walking towards Cora like you’re going to talk to her?”</p>
<p>Another girl, a tall redhead in a pink shirt with hearts printed all over it, whose name I thought was Leah, chimed in as well. “Yeah, Cora doesn’t want to talk to you. Just go back to your seat and stick your ugly nose in your ugly book, new girl.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, new girl,” jeered Greta, and Sweta added, “New girl!” as if that by itself were an insult. And the way they said it, it almost was.</p>
<p>I shrank back, getting ready to give up, but then Cora spoke, her words spitting out like a cat hissing in the back of its throat.</p>
<p>“I was trying to get my brother to give me his old record player,” she said. “I’ll tell you the rest after class.”</p>
<p>I thought it best to get out of there as quickly as possible, so I said “Okay, after class”, freed myself from Willow’s grip, and quickly returned to my own seat.</p>
<p>But after class, Miss Hanover handed back our tests from last week, and Cora and I both discovered that we’d failed math. She kept us for extra lessons so we could go over the problems we’d failed on the tests. After half an hour of math, Miss Hanover let me go, and kept Cora back to work on reading.</p>
<p>I went over to the clubroom and found Lily and Ranta both inside. Lily was tending the plants in the pots and vases, while Ranta sat at the table with a cup of tea.</p>
<p>“So, Lily, I’d like to ask you something,” Ranta said just as I came in. She flashed me a smile and indicated that she’d set out a cup and saucer for me at the table. I sat down, and Ranta poured me a cup of jasmine tea, a delicious fragrance rising from the cup as it filled.</p>
<p>“Go ahead, ask me anything,” said Lily. “You can ask me anything. I can’t answer anything, but I can answer what I can answer.”</p>
<p>“You said you have a set of pajamas made by Doris and Phyllis,” said Ranta. I sipped my tea and took a chocolate-filled roll cookie from the plate that Ranta passed me.</p>
<p>“I do,” said Lily. “I have pajamas made by four different animals that start with <em>s</em>—spiders, silkworms, sloths, and seals.”</p>
<p>“And it doesn’t bother you that you’re wearing something made from silk that came from the spider’s—the spider’s you-know-where?”</p>
<p>“Not really. It just doesn’t bother me,” said Lily.</p>
<p>“You know where the you-know-where is, right?”</p>
<p>“The abdomen?”</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah, close enough. So how do you deal with it?”</p>
<p>“It just doesn’t bother me,” Lily repeated.</p>
<p>Ranta nodded meaningfully. I couldn’t tell what the meaning was, but I knew it had some meaning. I sipped down my tea and took another roll cookie. Ranta took one too, and then said, “So what happened to Cora? Did either of you find out?”</p>
<p>“Not me,” said Lily.</p>
<p>“I tried asking her this morning,” I said. “She told me she was trying to get her brother’s old record player.”</p>
<p>“Trying to get her brother’s old record player?” Ranta repeated, confused. “But what does that have to do with her hair turning black?”</p>
<p>“She said she’d tell me after class,” I said. “But both of us failed our math tests, so Miss Hanover kept us back to go over them. And after we were done, she kept Cora back to go over the reading test.”</p>
<p>“And what about her glasses?” Lily added. “I thought she was blind as a eucalyptus without them.”</p>
<p>“Her glasses were back on this morning,” I said.</p>
<p>“I know her roommate has the Gift of Singing and likes to blast opera music,” said Lily. “That might be why she wanted a record player. She wanted to drown out her roommate.”</p>
<p>“But how would that make her hair black?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Maybe her brother made her prove herself,” Ranta suggested. “Maybe he made her go on a quest to show she was worthy to receive his old record player. After all, if he’s Cora’s brother, he’s probably pretty twisted, right?”</p>
<p>Lily perked up when she heard that, and a sudden mood struck me, and I said, “Of course, that must be it. Cora’s brother was willing to give her the record player, but he wanted a fair trade. He wanted a stone from the bottom of Inky Lake, at the highest peak of the furthest-away mountain. Cora knew there was only one way to get it: she had to go there, dive into the lake, and pull it out.”</p>
<p>“Since they didn’t have them at the gift shop,” said Ranta.</p>
<p>“Cora started to climb the mountain. She climbed up the winding trail, scaled many crags, and clambered up countless crevasses to get up to the peak.”</p>
<p>As I spoke, all three of us could feel ourselves leaving the comfortable clubroom at the school and going off to the peak of the faraway mountain. The scent of jasmine tea became the scent of pine, and the flowers became poison oak and bramble. It helped that we’d just spent a weekend in the wilds ourselves; I could imagine the mountain near our campgrounds, where we’d spent Saturday and half of Sunday looking at rocks and trees and the river.</p>
<p>“Cora even had to fight a pine cat,” I continued. “She came up to where it was eating a rack of ribs, and she said ‘Give me those ribs, pine cat!’”</p>
<p>“And the pine cat said, ‘Get your own!’ So Cora punched him in the nose. And he left the ribs behind, and said, ‘I’ll get you for this someday!’ But after she’d fought the pine cat for them, Cora just left the ribs behind.</p>
<p>“After a while, Cora came to a village of dwarves. The dwarves told her that a cruel witch was menacing them, flying over each day, cackling and screeching, throwing balls of fire at them and burning down their workshops and stopping them from making their flagship product.”</p>
<p>“They were very practical dwarves,” said Ranta, “and where other dwarves might have wasted their time making golden rings or emerald necklaces, these dwarves made—”</p>
<p>“Tuna cans?” Lily asked.</p>
<p>“Zipper pulls?” I suggested, after a glance down at my book bag.</p>
<p>“The prongs of lamp plugs!” said Ranta.</p>
<p>I picked up the story again. “The dwarves told Cora they had a secret path that could lead her halfway to the summit. But they would only let her use it if she could stop the witch from menacing them, so they could get back to making practical things like tuna cans, zipper pulls, and the prongs of lamp plugs.</p>
<p>“Cora agreed. She went off and found the witch, who lived in a squat little cabin on the side of the mountain. Cora thought the best way to defeat the witch would be to challenge her to a game of wits.”</p>
<p>“Of course, Cora lost the game of wits,” said Ranta.</p>
<p>“And she now found herself tied up,” said Lily, “lying on the witch’s table. ‘You’ll make me a fine meal!’ the witch cackled—” And here Lily did a very good witch cackle, which took me by surprise and sent a chill down my spine.</p>
<p>“Fortunately,” I said, “Cora had been inside Lily’s garden before she started climbing the mountain. She had something in her pocket that could defeat that witch.</p>
<p>“Cora told the witch, ‘Witch, I don’t mind if you eat me, but I’m afraid I won’t taste very good without seasoning. There are some herbs in my pocket. Please use them to season me.’</p>
<p>“And the witch did. What she didn’t know was that the herb in Cora’s pocket was blustersage. As soon as she seasoned Cora, Cora ate a few leaves. And she huffed, and she puffed, and she blew the witch’s house down!</p>
<p>“Cora then chewed through her ropes with her sharp fangs. Freed from her ties, Cora started to insult the witch. ‘You’ve got a wart on your nose! Why not see a doctor about that?’ she mocked. The witch was so offended that she turned into a housefly and flew away.”</p>
<p>“And Cora,” said Ranta, “being a cat, was able to catch her and swallow her down, where she melted in Cora’s stomach acid.”</p>
<p>The three of us laughed for a while at the image of Cora swallowing the fly, before we continued.</p>
<p>“The dwarves allowed Cora to use their secret path. But they told her there was one more danger to face: just before the summit, there lived a vicious giant named Andre, who loved to dance” I said. “He would challenge anyone who passed to a dance-off, and anyone who couldn’t dance better than him got eaten!</p>
<p>“Cora made her way up the path, towards the summit. But just before she reached the top, she ran into the giant, Andre. Andre was big, huge, hideous, and slobbering. He stank like a thousand piles of garbage and a hundred sewers. His teeth were yellow and black, like a hive of bees. When he spoke, his horrible breath wafted across Cora, carrying a great stench of the gum disease gingivitis.”</p>
<p>“Andre then hitched up his white pants and put on his white jacket,” said Ranta, “and he led Cora onto his dance floor, his disco ball spinning high above them, and said ‘This is my Platinum Disco! If you can show that your disco is more platinum than mine, I’ll let you past. Otherwise, I’ll be polishing you off the platinum in my teeth!’”</p>
<p>“Then Andre danced,” I said, “and the mountain rumbled, and the ground shook, with the force of his groovy moves.”</p>
<p>“But Cora had a secret weapon,” Lily joined in. “In her pocket, she had three choreographed carrots she had taken from the garden. These carrots would sync up their movements with hers, making them perfect backup dancers.”</p>
<p>“Cora danced, and the choreographed carrots danced with her,” I said. “And they danced, and they danced, and even Andre was forced to admit that Cora’s disco was more platinum than his. But Andre had no intention of playing fair. He tried to grab Cora and eat her anyway!”</p>
<p>“But Cora had one last trick up her sleeve,” said Lily. “She had a handful of spring-heeled onions in her pocket. When she ate them, she gained super jumping abilities. Cora jumped over Andre and sprung up the rest of the peak, all the way to the summit, leaving Andre shaking his fist at her.”</p>
<p>“Now she’d finally reached the summit,” I said. “It was time to dive into Inky Lake and claim an inkstone.</p>
<p>“Cora dived in, and the dark waters dyed her hair deep black, just as we saw it when she walked in last night and I didn’t recognize her. She grabbed a stone and surfaced, thinking herself victorious, only to be grabbed by a hawk!</p>
<p>“The hawk was a friend of the pine cat whose ribs Cora had stolen earlier. His friend the pine cat had sent him to get revenge on Cora for stealing those ribs. The hawk told Cora he was going to bring her back to his nest and eat her.”</p>
<p>“Then he’d throw her up for his chicks,” Ranta added, to cries of “Eww!” and “Gross!” from me and Lily.</p>
<p>“But the hawk didn’t count on Cora’s sharp tongue,” Ranta went on. “Cora called the hawk names and said terrible things about his family, things so cruel he had to cry. But being a tough hawk, he didn’t want anyone to see him crying, so he lifted a claw to wipe his eyes. And when he did, he dropped Cora.”</p>
<p>“But Cora had stolen one more plant from the garden,” I said. “Icarus palm leaves. With these, she was able to fly home. But just because she could fly, that didn’t mean she could land.”</p>
<p>“Cora crashed into the roof of her house and fell down the chimney. She emerged into her living room in a cloud of soot and ash.”</p>
<p>“When her little sister saw Cora, she thought Santa Claus had come early that year, and she begged for a present. But Cora had nothing to give her. To make her little sister stop crying, Cora gave her the inkstone.”</p>
<p>“But Cora’s brother, being just as wicked and cruel as Cora,” said Ranta, “told her ‘You didn’t deliver me the inkstone. You failed your quest.’ And after all that, Cora didn’t get the record player after all.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Cora opened the door and came in.</p>
<p>I froze. My heart was pounding. Had she heard us? If she had, she was definitely going to yell at me.</p>
<p>Cora sat down at the table and sighed. “Glad that’s over.”</p>
<p>“So, Cora, I hear you didn’t do so well on your exams,” said Ranta casually. “You know, <em>I</em> passed everything.”</p>
<p>“Just shut up. Please, just shut your ugly face,” Cora muttered. “I’m not in the mood to listen to you right now.”</p>
<p>Trying to defuse the situation, I stood up and poured Cora a cup of tea, and offered her roll cookies, hoping the sweets would calm her down. I was planning to wait for her to work her way through five or six of them before I piped up, but Lily, much braver than me, beat me to it.</p>
<p>“So, Cora, about your hair…” Lily said.</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah. See, my roommate, Victoria, has the Gift of Singing,” said Cora. “She loves opera. It gets pretty annoying after a while, listening to the soprano parts from <em>Carmen</em> and <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em> and <em>The Ring of the Nibelungs</em> every day. So I asked Lucian, my brother, if I could borrow his old record player. I was hoping I could drown Victoria out, at least for a little while.</p>
<p>“Lucian told me he wouldn’t give it to me unless I beat him in a challenge, even though that jerk hasn’t used the thing since I was five years old. But I really wanted it, so I took the challenge.”</p>
<p>“What did he make you do?” Lily asked.</p>
<p>“He made me take allergy pills and try to stay awake. Every ten minutes I stayed awake, it was another pill.”</p>
<p>It was just like Cora to completely ignore the possibility of death because she wanted a record player. Taking a pill every ten minutes could have killed her, if it was the wrong kind of pill. But Cora’s brother was in medical school, so I guessed he knew which pills were dangerous.</p>
<p>“I fell asleep after about thirty minutes, and when I woke up, that jerk had dyed my hair black. My parents yelled at me for dying my hair. Last night, Mrs. Lovett yelled at me for dying my hair. This morning, Miss Hanover—didn’t yell at me, but I could see her trying not to laugh at me when I told her how this happened.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Lovett was the dorm mother; it was her job to make sure we did our laundry and kept our rooms clean, and it was also her job to organize and lead the cleaning crews that took care of the common areas. Every student had to take part in a cleaning crew at least once a month; Mrs. Lovett was strict about that. She was strict about everything, so it was easy to imagine her being strict with Cora for breaking the rule on hair dyeing.</p>
<p>“Well, maybe it was all worth it,” said Lily, turning back to her plants to resume watering. “After all, you got the record player. Now you can drown out Victoria.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Cora. “That’s the worst part.”</p>
<p>“What?” I asked, curiosity overcoming fear.</p>
<p>“When I went back to my room to drop my stuff off, after Miss Hanover let me out, Victoria told me she’d made up a new song. It was called ‘I Cannot Be Drowned Out By Cora’s Brother’s Old Record Player’. When she sang it, not only did I hear every bit of it no matter how loud I turned up the volume, after a few minutes, the record player broke in half. It’s gone now.”</p>
<p>It’s not quite as fantastical as the story that Lily, Ranta, and I made up together, but Cora did have an interesting weekend.</p>
<h1 id="puzzles-arent-that-hard.-by-lily.">Puzzles aren’t that hard. By Lily.</h1>
<p>How are you? I’m Lily.</p>
<p>Even though I’ve never talked to you before, I’m not here today to tell you about myself. I’m pretty boring, to be honest. I have the Gift of Gardening. If you’ve ever thought about which superpower you’d choose if you could have any you like, you probably didn’t choose gardening.</p>
<p>Today I’m going to tell you about something that happened to my friend Nora. She wouldn’t tell you herself because she didn’t want to sound like she was bragging. But even if she did brag a little, I think that would be all right, because Nora has a gift that’s a lot more amazing than my gardening. But she got embarrassed when I told her, and said she didn’t like to boast or brag, and wouldn’t talk about it anymore. Even though she’s really smart—I might even say she’s a genius—she’s so modest. She’s the opposite of someone like Cora, who has a little talent and a big mouth. That’s why I love her. Well, one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Nora and I had known each other for about three weeks when this happened. She’d been helping me in the garden, and had joined my club, the Helping Hands. We’d helped Ms. Rutherford clean the PE shed together; we’d gotten rid of a dog for the student council; and we’d gone on a camping trip with the Geology club. Nothing much had happened since the camping trip, and we’d spent most of our days drinking tea in the clubroom while Cora and Ranta fought over various things.</p>
<p>Nora didn’t know I had spent most of the nights of the past three weeks sleeping in a hammock in the garden, strung up between two Artillerinut trees (those are the trees that shot at her just before she and I met. I felt so bad about that!). I would eat dinner in the elementary school dining hall with my friends, and then I would go out and head for the middle school building. On the way, I’d take a detour to the garden and spend the night there. I’d wake up with the rising sun and go over to the middle school dormitory, and slip into my room and change clothes while my roommate was at breakfast. Then I’d go to breakfast, attend morning classes, then slip back into the room and change into my gardening clothes, and go work in the garden through afternoon classes, heading over to the clubroom when the elementary school classes let out.</p>
<p>But yesterday, I’d stepped through the dewy grass, cool with the air of the setting sun, and lain down on my hammock only to find there was a chilly breeze passing between the two trees, which made it too cold to sleep there. I had thought for a minute about what to do. I decided to sneak into the clubroom; no one would be there at this time of night.</p>
<p>The gates of the elementary school area were shut, but all I had to do was climb the fence and I was in. I couldn’t directly climb on the tall, smooth black iron poles, but there was a nice growth of ivy wrapped around them that I could use to climb up to the top, as long as I kept my weight spread out enough that I didn’t break any of the vines. I clambered over the spiky tops of the poles and came down in the courtyard, glad for my thick boots that absorbed the shock of my hard landing.</p>
<p>The office building looked eerie in the twilight, like a haunted house just before the Witching Hour was to begin. Rays of orange light were bouncing off the windows, like the glow in the eyes of a dying tiger. But even though I felt like I was doing something bad, I knew I had to get in there. Otherwise I might wake up tomorrow with a cold, and then who would look after the garden?</p>
<p>I came around the building to the tall white doors, so happy and inviting by day, so gloomy and forbidding by evening. The lights in the lobby were still on, but it looked like most of the windows were dark. I tried the knob. It was still unlocked, so someone was inside, but I hoped I’d be able to get to the clubroom without being spotted.</p>
<p>My hopes were dashed the moment I opened the door; standing in the lobby, just getting ready to lock up, was one of the elementary school teachers. He wasn’t very old; like Miss Hanover, he looked like he’d just gotten out of college. Everything about him gave off an air of precision: his neatly combed hair, his crisp white shirt, his pressed and pleated slacks, and his tie, which somehow seemed to stay perfectly flat against his front, even when his movements should have made it flap. I didn’t know his name, but I didn’t think he’d be very happy about me being here so late, so I tried to quickly steal inside and hide in a dark corner next to the door.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t quick enough, and the teacher saw me. “Oh, hello,” he said. “I was just about to lock up. Did you need something?”</p>
<p>Caught, I came forward into the light. I knew my only chance was to lie. I’ve always been a terrible liar, though, so it was a slim chance. But I tried anyway. “Um, I just forgot something in my clubroom,” I said. “I came back to get it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, okay. Do you want me to walk up with you? Then I can lock up afterwards. Mrs. Henderson—” She was the secretary who oversaw the front office. “—will have my skin if I forget.” He held up a shiny brass key, which must have been the key to the two tall white doors I had just come through.</p>
<p>“Um, that’s all right. I-I can get it by myself. Um, just go ahead and lock up. I’ll find my own way out.”</p>
<p>Anyone with eyes could see I was carrying a blanket and pillow, and anyone with a brain could work out that I didn’t need those things to get something I’d forgotten in the clubroom. Also, unless I was a magician (which I wasn’t), there was no way I could just find my own way out of a locked building. So it was a pretty weak lie, like most of mine. And this teacher I didn’t know was looking at me with suspicion, like he thought I was lying, which I was. I wanted to sink back into the corner and become a potted plant, like the one behind the reception desk, just so I didn’t have to see him staring at me.</p>
<p>“You’re Lily van Rossum, aren’t you?” the teacher asked.</p>
<p>“Y-yes…How did you know?”</p>
<p>“Miss Hanover told me that you’re the president of some sort of volunteer club…the Helping Hands?”</p>
<p>I ventured a little bit further out of the corner, a little bit closer to the teacher. “That’s right,” I said. This seemed like a weird thing to be talking about if he were going to yell at me and put me in detention, so I thought he probably wasn’t. “We like using our unique gifts to help people. Of course, we’ll help anyone who needs it. We helped Ms. Rutherford clear the old PE sheds, and we helped Mrs. Julian on the Geology Club camping trip, and two of our members, Nora and Cora, helped the student council get rid of a stray dog that was causing trouble.”</p>
<p>“Are any of your members good at puzzles?” the teacher asked.</p>
<p>I certainly wasn’t, and I couldn’t see Cora being any good at them. Nora and Ranta might be okay, but I didn’t think either of them were secret masters of puzzles. “I don’t think so,” I said.</p>
<p>“Well, I guess it doesn’t matter that much if they’re good or not…Listen, I’m Daniel Wardlaw. I’m the faculty supervisor for the Puzzle Club.” He held out his hand. I came forward, completely out of the dark corner, and shook it, finally convinced he wasn’t going to yell at me. “We’re holding a Puzzle Contest for the elementary school this weekend, but…we’re short on people. Only the members of the Puzzle Club have signed up to compete so far. We were really hoping to have a strong challenger, or at least some people good enough to recruit to the club.”</p>
<p>“You want me to enter my members?” I asked. “But, Mr. Wardlaw, I’ve just told you, I don’t think any of them are good at puzzles…”</p>
<p>“That’s okay. If people from outside the club enter, maybe it’ll get more people from outside to enter. At worst, we’ll have a few fillers for the early rounds before our people have to face each other. Besides,” Mr. Wardlaw added with a smile, “if you do this this for me, I could let you go up to your clubroom and get whatever you forgot, while I lock up and let you find your own way out.”</p>
<p>I felt a chill up my spine. He’d tricked me.</p>
<p>“I’ll do it,” I agreed.</p>
<p>“Good. By the way, Miss van Rossum, I don’t know why you’re sleeping in your clubroom, but if it’s anything I can help you with, please let me know. Miss Hanover tells me you’re a good girl and a good student, so I trust you have your reasons.” He went for the door, and flashed me a smile on his way out, his straight, white teeth shining gold in the light of the dying sun. “Well, I’ll just lock things up. Good night.”</p>
<p>“Ah…Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>Ah, he was really handsome when he smiled.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When I got up to the clubroom, I had a little trouble finding somewhere to sleep. I had first bedded down on the window seat. I knew Nora slept there sometimes, and I had liked being able to see the stars and the distant lights of the high school buildings across the campus. But the cold, damp drafts of air coming off the glass had eventually driven me to the sofa in the corner.</p>
<p>I had meant to wake up early the next day, but the sofa was so comfortable that I overslept; when I woke up, I could already hear teachers talking in the corridors outside the clubroom. I got up and hid my blanket and pillow in one of the cupboards. Now that tests were over and homework was starting to pick up again, it was possible I’d be able to sleep in my room tonight. But if I couldn’t, I’d be sure to get in here earlier, so I wouldn’t have another close call like yesterday.</p>
<p>I took a hairbrush from my satchel and, looking at my reflection in the big window, did my best to tame my hair. Rather than tie it into a long braid like I usually did, I just tied it back into a ponytail with a rubber band. I put on the spare pair of socks I always carried in my satchel (in case I got my feet wet watering something), then put my overalls and boots back on.</p>
<p>That done, I went out into the corridor. While it was unusual for a student to be in the office building early in the morning, it wasn’t unheard of, so when I passed by a pair of older women chatting in the hall, they didn’t give me a second look.</p>
<p>Rather than going out by the main doors, which might make Mrs. Henderson suspect something, I went up the hall towards the teachers’ lounge, where there was a staircase I could take down to the back exit. I passed out into the courtyard and headed for the dining hall.</p>
<p>When I got inside, I saw that Nora and Ranta were sitting together at a table in the far corner. Nora had her back to me, but Ranta noticed me come in and waved, and Nora turned and waved too. I waved back, smiling as best as I could. I didn’t go over to them right away, though; instead, I got in line for some scrambled eggs, pancakes, and fruit salad. I felt myself moving slowly on purpose, trying to put off the time I would have to tell them that we were entering a puzzle contest. In the past I had always let them choose whether they wanted to help me on a job or not. Now, I couldn’t afford to give them that choice, but I also couldn’t tell them what was really going on. It was making me nervous.</p>
<p>Finally, though, I couldn’t take any more time choosing my breakfast. I then went over to them, hoping they would be willing to help me.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Lily,” said Nora as I sat down next to her. A battered book called <em>The World’s Last Night</em>, by C.S. Lewis, lay on the table in front of her. She must have been reading it when Ranta found her.</p>
<p>“Morning,” I said.</p>
<p>“Looks like you left in a hurry,” said Ranta. “Were you in the garden?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I lied. “The calamomile is in bloom right now, and I wanted to make sure it didn’t cross-pollinate the chamorose, so I was doing some pruning.”</p>
<p>Ranta seemed to believe me, but Nora wore a troubled expression. While I ate my breakfast, Nora and Ranta went back to discussing books. Nora and Ranta are very different: Ranta is mature, calm under pressure, and outgoing, while Nora is shy and gets flustered easily. But they both like long, hard, dense books, books whose ideas I couldn’t even begin to understand. From what they were saying, I understood that Ranta had let Nora borrow <em>The World’s Last Night</em>, and that it was full of strange, difficult ideas about religion.</p>
<p>I was just finishing with my pancakes and getting into tea and fruit salad when Nora turned to me, squirming a little, and said, “Um, Lily? I notice you haven’t braided your hair.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I didn’t really have time,” I said. I kept my face on my fruit salad, hoping it wouldn’t give me away.</p>
<p>“Well, if it’s all right, would you like me to do it for you? Um, I used to braid my sister’s hair sometimes, so I’m not bad at it.”</p>
<p>Surprised and touched, I smiled. “I’d love that,” I said. “But I’ve got a lot of hair, so don’t worry about giving up if you get tired in the middle, okay?”</p>
<p>“I won’t,” said Nora.</p>
<p>I drank my tea without moving my head too much while Nora braided my hair and continued her conversation with Ranta. Partway through, Cora showed up, carrying her breakfast tray.</p>
<p>It looked like I wasn’t the only one who hadn’t had time to do her hair properly this morning. Cora’s hair was still black from when her brother had dyed it, and she hadn’t tied it into her usual twin ponytails. It was hanging loose, so full of knots that it looked like a patch of blackberry bramble which had overgrown a tangle of kudzu, which had then become the nesting site for several families of birds. Her eyes had a heavy, sleepless look to them, which didn’t really make sense to me, since she would have had to sleep on her hair to get it that messy.</p>
<p>“Um…Good morning, Cora,” said Nora uncertainly as Cora sat down next to Ranta.</p>
<p>“Morning.” She shot Nora a venomous scowl, making Nora flinch a little, then forced her face into a smile as she turned to me. “Lily, can I please do your hair next time?”</p>
<p>“Try doing your own hair first,” said Ranta.</p>
<p>They fought for about five minutes after that, but I ignored them, as I always did when they started fighting, and focused on my tea and the pleasant feeling of Nora’s small, soft hands in my hair.</p>
<p>After Cora and Ranta had finished fighting, I decided I’d better tell them about the job. Hoping they’d all agree to help me, I opened my mouth.</p>
<p>I forgot that I had tea in my mouth.</p>
<p>The tea went down my windpipe, and I coughed for about a minute. Nora patted me on the back to help it go down, and I opened my mouth again.</p>
<p>“Do any of you know Mr. Wardlaw?” I said.</p>
<p>“Wardlaw? Isn’t he that nutjob—” Cora began.</p>
<p>“The one who gave the assembly where he tried to teach us calculus?” Ranta said, nodding. “I know him. Half of my class hates him, and the other half have crushes on him because he’s handsome, but none of them understood a single word he said during that assembly.”</p>
<p>“I still have nightmares about it sometimes,” Nora sighed. “Where I’m being chased by those upside-down triangles and backwards sixes he kept writing on the board.”</p>
<p>This didn’t look good for me. They already knew him as a lunatic. But I had to ask anyway. “Mr. Wardlaw is the head of the Puzzle Club,” I said. “He needs more people to enter the puzzle contest this weekend. He asked if you could all enter.” I looked around at the abject terror on all of their faces, and quickly added, “Just so there’s someone from outside the club. I can’t enter, since middle schoolers aren’t allowed.”</p>
<p>“If the puzzles are anything like that assembly, you’ve got to be way past middle school to solve them,” said Ranta. “More like fourth year of college. Not just any college, either. Some math nerd school, like MIT. Sorry, Lily, but I don’t think my nerves can take it.”</p>
<p>My heart sank. I looked around at Cora and Nora, hoping for a volunteer. They both looked uncertain. I had to do something to get them in. It made me feel bad to take advantage of my friends like this, but I didn’t know what else to do; after all, I did owe Mr. Wardlaw one for last night.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath. “The truth is, I really need your help. I…got in trouble with Mr. Wardlaw last night. He told me he wouldn’t punish me if I could get some more people to enter the contest. I’m sorry, I don’t like asking like this…that’s why I didn’t say anything at first…but I do need your help. I’ll owe all of you an ice cream if you’ll do it.”</p>
<p>The three of them exchanged a look. Nora was the first to speak. “Um, if you really need my help, then of course I’ll help you,” she said. “After all, it can’t be worse than the hornet shed, or the dog, right?” she added, looking around at the others.</p>
<p>“The dog was only bad because you’re a flailer,” said Cora. “But you’re right. If it’s to help Lily, I’m in.”</p>
<p>“Me too,” said Ranta. “You should’ve told us you needed our help in the first place, Lily. Of course I’ll help.”</p>
<p>It made me happy that they all agreed to help me, and I was also glad that they hadn’t insisted on knowing how I’d gotten in trouble. I did wish I could’ve told them how nice Mr. Wardlaw actually was, though.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Not only did I feel bad about making Mr. Wardlaw sound a lot meaner than he really was, I also felt awful about lying to my friends like that.</p>
<p>The three of them went to Mr. Wardlaw with me so they could ask to enter the puzzle contest. When I saw how happy he was, I felt a little better, even if Nora was hiding behind her bangs the whole time and Ranta looked at him like he was a crazy, dangerous criminal when he nearly danced around the room with joy.</p>
<p>I felt terrible again after I found Nora asleep in the clubroom one day, lying on the window seat with a puzzle book open and laid over her face. I felt worst for asking her to get involved. Ranta was mature and calm, so she could handle the pressure of being in front of all those people and getting a puzzle wrong. I didn’t really care what happened to Cora. But Nora was shy and had a hard time being around strangers, so there was no doubt that she was having a hard time with this. But she’d still gone to the library to find puzzle books, hoping to make a good show of it.</p>
<p>I started sleeping in the dormitory again and didn’t have any more run-ins with teachers, and before I knew it, the weekend had come, and the day of the contest.</p>
<p>Since the weather was still nice, the contest was being held out on the grounds, outside the elementary school fence. I met the others at the elementary school gate, and we walked together to the site of the contest, halfway between the elementary school and the high school.</p>
<p>Cora once again looked awful, although she’d made a little effort to brush her hair this time. I wasn’t going to say anything, but Nora, compassionate soul that she is, asked if Cora was sleeping all right.</p>
<p>“No,” Cora growled, and Nora recoiled a little.</p>
<p>“Um, is s-something in particular keeping you awake?” she asked Cora.</p>
<p>“My roommate, Victoria. After she destroyed my brother’s old record player, I tried buying a new record player from the high school store to drown her out. But she wrote a song called ‘I Cannot Be Drowned Out By the Record Player Cora Bought at the High School Store’, and when she sang it next to the record player, the piece of junk shattered into pieces.”</p>
<p>“So her singing has been keeping you awake?” Nora asked.</p>
<p>“She’s been giving concerts of ‘I Cannot Be Drowned Out By the Record Player Cora Bought at the High School Store’ all around the dorm room whenever I’m trying to sleep,” Cora snarled.</p>
<p>We passed in silence under an old oak tree, its wide branches harboring a cool breeze. It was at peace here, I could feel, watching over us students as we played sports and took walks every day, and it was looking forward to the puzzle contest, as my friends were not.</p>
<p>“I wonder what kind of puzzles they’re going to have,” Ranta commented as we came out on the other side of the shade cast by the oak.</p>
<p>“I hope I’ve studied enough,” said Nora, a nervous chatter in her teeth. “I studied word puzzles and logic puzzles and riddles. I tried doing some number puzzles, but…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, someone who failed math would have trouble with those,” said Cora.</p>
<p>“And someone who failed reading would have trouble with word puzzles, and someone who failed thinking would have trouble with logic puzzles, so just what do you think you’re going to solve, Cora?” said Ranta.</p>
<p>“You shut up! And there’s no such subject as thinking!”</p>
<p>I blocked out their fighting as usual. I saw that Nora was fidgeting nervously at my side, her fingers woven together and wiggling back and forth, her eyes fixed on their movements. Figuring I could at least try to help her through the mess I’d made for her, I put my hand on her shoulder. “Don’t worry, Nora. It’ll be all right.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s just…Well, promise me you won’t think I’m bragging or anything?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” I agreed. I gently guided her around a large stone, which she hadn’t seen because she was so focused on what her fingers were doing.</p>
<p>“I, I’m usually good at school. It’s kind of the only thing I am good at. S-so it’s hard for me…to think about looking stupid in front of people. Please don’t think I’m bragging,” she added, her cheeks turning pink as she finally turned away from her fingers and looked at me.</p>
<p>“I don’t. You <em>are</em> good at school. You <em>are</em> smart. I know it, Nora. Even if you can’t answer a single puzzle, I know it. But since you are smart, and you’ve been studying, maybe you’ll even surprise them and take down one or two of their champions.”</p>
<p>Nora shook her head. “I-I won’t. But thanks for believing in me, Lily.”</p>
<p>Cora and Ranta stopped fighting as we reached the site of the contest. Obviously, Mr. Wardlaw hadn’t expected many people to turn up to watch; they’d only set up about twenty spectator chairs. Even that had been hoping for too much; there was no one at all in the audience. There were also eight chairs for the eight members of the Puzzle Club. I didn’t know any of the members; they were mostly boys, although there were two girls, one wearing a green T-shirt with a silver Chinese dragon painted on it, the other with a blonde ponytail and pink jeans with heart-shaped pockets.</p>
<p>Facing the spectator area from across a long table were three teachers, who I assumed were the judges: Mr. Wardlaw, Miss Hanover, and a third teacher, one I recognized from the middle school. She was short enough to be a middle school student, and her face had a round, childish look to it. Even Nora looked older than her. Her round, furry ears and fuzzy ball of a tail made her look like a teddy bear, and without her usual labcoat and glasses, her skirt and button-up shirt looked like doll clothes, like a child dressing up as her mother for fun. She wore her bruin-brown hair in a casual loose ponytail, far different from Miss Hanover’s carefully groomed carpet of red hair, and unlike the poised Miss Hanover and the excited Mr. Wardlaw, she was tapping her finger on the table and staring around, looking bored.</p>
<p>“They’ve got a student judging,” Ranta commented, indicating the third judge.</p>
<p>“She’s not a student,” I said, “and let’s try not to talk to her.”</p>
<p>“Do you know her?” Nora asked.</p>
<p>“She’s Ursula Huckle. She’s the science teacher at the middle school.”</p>
<p>“Is she a bear woman?” Nora seemed interested in getting a closer look, but Mr. Wardlaw had seen us coming and came forward eagerly to meet us.</p>
<p>“Good, good. Miss Rosen, Miss Reyes, Miss Fiorentino, may I please conduct you to your seats? Miss van Rossum, you may take a seat in the audience.”</p>
<p>This was the first time I’d ever heard their last names; I still didn’t know which name belonged to who. I imagined that Ranta was Miss Reyes.</p>
<p>I took a seat in the audience (I had my pick of the best ones; I tried to sit where Miss Huckle wouldn’t have any reason to notice me), and Mr. Wardlaw began the contest.</p>
<p>“Okay, here’s how it’ll go,” he said. “I’ll call two names. I’ve got you all matched up here—” He held up a piece of paper. “You’ll sit down there—” He waved his hand at two chairs which had been set up facing the judges’ table. “I’ll give you three puzzles, one at a time. If you think you have an answer, raise your hand and tell us. If you win two puzzles of the three, you win the round. If you lose a round, you’re out, and you have to go sit in the audience. If no one gets an answer within five minutes, we’ll move on to a new puzzle, and try that one on the next pair. Miss Hanover—” Miss Hanover smiled and gave a cheerful wave. “—and Miss Huckle—” Miss Huckle sneered, her cute, round face twisting with contempt. “—will be judging your answers. Does everyone understand?”</p>
<p>There was a murmur of confirmation from the contestants. “Okay,” said Mr. Wardlaw. “Then our first round will be Mr. Locke versus Miss Reyes!”</p>
<p>Ranta came forward, along with a brown-haired boy wearing a bandanna around his head. “Okay, your first puzzle is a word puzzle,” announced Mr. Wardlaw. “What’s a word that has three of one letter, two of another letter, and one of three more letters, one of them <em>z</em>? Additionally, if you change the first two letters, it goes from your kitchen to your bathroom.”</p>
<p>I could see why no one had turned up to watch this. It wasn’t very interesting, watching Ranta and Locke squirm nervously as they tried to think of an answer to this insane question. At the end of five minutes, neither of them had an answer. Both of them also failed at the next question, a riddle: “I harvest the earth, live by the earth, breathe in the earth. I work the earth without end; I never put my spade down, even when I die. Who am I?” But Locke managed to win by answering the third puzzle after three minutes; he figured out that the word “you can inflate by three letters to go from one round thing to another” was <em>ball</em>, which you could add to and get <em>balloon</em>.</p>
<p>Ranta came to join me in the spectator’s area after she had lost. “That was brutal,” she said. “Can’t wait to see Cora get thrashed.”</p>
<p>Her chance to see Cora get thrashed came soon, because Cora (who, it turned out, was “Miss Fiorentino”) was called up next, along with Mr. Figaro, a blond-haired boy with a very strong chin. Cora proceeded to stare at Mr. Wardlaw for fifteen solid minutes, looking more like a sheep than a cat, while Mr. Figaro puzzled over the first two questions from the last round. He had no more success with them than Ranta had, but he did tell the judges that the thing which you “feed to grow, water to kill” was a campfire.</p>
<p>“You should’ve come on the camping trip with us,” said Ranta as Cora came to join us in the spectator’s area. “You might have been able to get that one.”</p>
<p>“Oh shut up, Miss Amaranta Reyes,” Cora snapped. “Hope Nora’s up next, then she can lose quickly, and we can get out of here.”</p>
<p>It turned out that Nora was up next; she was called up to compete with Miss Chere, the girl in the Chinese dragon T-shirt. Mr. Wardlaw opened with the kitchen-to-bathroom question again. After about thirty seconds, Nora timidly raised her hand.</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss Rosen?” said Mr. Wardlaw.</p>
<p>“Um, well, I had a little time to think about this while I was waiting. Um, the word is f-f-‘freezers’, right?”</p>
<p>Mr. Wardlaw stared at Nora curiously, and Miss Hanover, who had so far just been trying to look politely interested, focused in on Nora and smiled at her. Even Miss Huckle looked interested.</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” Mr. Wardlaw conceded. “Can you explain why?”</p>
<p>“Um, well, ‘freezers’ has th-three <em>e</em>’s, t-two <em>r</em>’s, and one <em>f</em>, <em>s</em>, and <em>z</em>. And freezers are in your kitchen, b-but if you ch-change the first two letters into…” Nora trailed off, but Miss Hanover gestured for her to keep going, and she swallowed, and did. “If you change the first two letters to <em>tw</em>, you get ‘tweezers’—that’s something in your bathroom, right? So it ‘goes from your kitchen to your bathroom’.”</p>
<p>“That seems reasonable,” said Mr. Wardlaw, “but—”</p>
<p>“Oh, give it a rest, Daniel, she’s got it,” said Miss Huckle, speaking for the first time and surprising everyone. Her voice was just as cute as her face, just as teddy bear-like as her ears and tail, but somehow you still got the feeling you shouldn’t mess with her. Or maybe only I got that feeling, because I knew her.</p>
<p>“Okay. Correct. One point, Miss Rosen,” said Mr. Wardlaw.</p>
<p>“Look at her,” Cora whispered, pointing at Miss Chere, Nora’s opponent. She looked absolutely dumbstruck, as if she’d expected this contest to be a cakewalk and it had turned out the cakes had teeth.</p>
<p>Mr. Wardlaw then gave the second question he’d given to Ranta and her opponent: “I harvest the earth, live by the earth, breathe in the earth. I work the earth without end; I never put my spade down, even when I die. Who am I?”</p>
<p>After about twenty-five seconds, Nora timidly raised her hand again, and Mr. Wardlaw called on her. “Yes, Miss Rosen?”</p>
<p>“Um, is the answer a mole? Because they h-harvest the earth—they d-dig around for w-worms and r-roots, right? And they ‘w-work the e-earth w-without end’, looking for food. They ‘b-breathe in the earth’, right? B-because they smell the d-d-dirt wh-when they’re d-digging to find f-food. And their ‘spades’ are their h-h-hands, s-s-s…” Once again Nora trailed off, and once again Miss Hanover gave her an encouraging look, and Nora took off again. “Um, so they don’t put their spades down even when they die, because even when they’re d-dead, their hands are still attached to them, r-right?”</p>
<p>“Right again,” said Miss Huckle, and Miss Hanover beamed. Mr. Wardlaw looked confused, and until Miss Huckle poked him in the side, he didn’t even remember that Miss Chere had lost.</p>
<p>“Your friend cheated,” said Miss Chere once she’d taken her seat in the audience. “No one could’ve known that freezer question without cheating.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, how’d she do that? Mind-reading?” Cora demanded. “You’re just mad ’cause you lost!”</p>
<p>“I didn’t lose! You can’t lose to a cheater!”</p>
<p>“You’re just mad ’cause you’re dumber than that dumb-looking milksop girl!” Cora taunted.</p>
<p>“I—am—”</p>
<p>“Quiet in the audience!” barked Miss Huckle, and both Cora and Miss Chere immediately quieted down, mostly from shock that such a voice could come out of such a pudding bowl-faced, teddy bear-looking woman.</p>
<p>After that, I expected Mr. Wardlaw to call up several members of the Puzzle Club. And he did call up Mr. Locke and Mr. Figaro to face each other in the next round. (Mr. Figaro won.) Then he called up Nora to face Mr. Figaro.</p>
<p>“What word can you take one letter out of, rearrange a little, and get a word that only has two sounds in common with it?”</p>
<p>Again, that tentative hand, after about thirty seconds. “Um, ‘region’,” Nora suggested. “Take out the <em>o</em> and swap the <em>g</em> and <em>i</em> and you get ‘reign’, which only has <em>r</em> and <em>n</em> in common with ‘region’.”</p>
<p>“Right again,” said Miss Huckle.</p>
<p>“Very good,” said Mr. Wardlaw, although he didn’t seem to think it was very good—he seemed to think it was very hard to understand how it had happened. “Here’s your next puzzle. Suppose you take off in a hot-air balloon from the coast of Cornwall, heading over the sea. You rise to a height of 100 meters. You then drop a bag of sand over the side of the balloon. How long does it take for the bag of sand to hit the ground?”</p>
<p>Nora seemed to be struggling with this. Mr. Figaro seemed to take heart at her failure to respond within thirty seconds. I started to think about it. The bag would fall straight down. The acceleration of gravity would be 9.8 meters per second per second. If the balloon was 100 meters up, and the bag weighed—</p>
<p>I noticed that Nora had raised her hand. She looked even more nervous than she had before, and even seemed about ready to put her hand down, but at another encouraging smile from Miss Hanover, she kept it raised.</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss Rosen?” said Mr. Wardlaw.</p>
<p>“Um, well, um, I thought at first this might be a physics problem, and I’m…not so good at math, so I didn’t think I could solve it. But then I realized—um, well, you said the balloon is over the sea. So it’d never hit the ground, right? At least, not until it got to the ocean floor.”</p>
<p>I slapped myself in the forehead, so loud that Ranta turned and looked at me. Of <em>course</em> that was the answer!</p>
<p>But from the expression on his face, Mr. Figaro had been trying to solve it the same way I was. All three of us had thought it was a physics problem, but Nora—the one who had failed her math test—had quickly tried looking for a way around the math, and had found the right answer. That had to be right, because without knowing the mass of the sandbag, there was no way to calculate how fast it would fall through the air.</p>
<p>Mr. Figaro came to join us in the losers’ area. “Not quite like the stuff we do in the club, huh, Celice?” he said to Miss Chere and Mr. Locke, with a rueful smile. “Your friend is pretty cool, though,” he added to me, Ranta, and Cora.</p>
<p>“She cheated, Ed,” Celice said again. “Roll your eyes if you want, Cole!” she snapped at Mr. Locke. “But she’s cheating somehow.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, she cheated on four different questions, against two different challengers, and is such a good actress that she faked all that stuttering and cowering just so you’d buy it,” Cora scoffed.</p>
<p>I ignored them and turned my eyes to the challenger area. There were still five members of the Puzzle Club left, and Nora.</p>
<p>Mr. Wardlaw next called up Mr. Gau, a rangy boy with a blond crew cut, and Mr. Gabbiani, who was tall and had long, black hair. “It’s gotta be Seth,” said Cole.</p>
<p>It was; Mr. Gau came to join us in the losers’ area, and Mr. Wardlaw next called up Nora again to face Seth Gabbiani.</p>
<p>“I come once in a minute, twice in a moment, but not once in a thousand years. What am I?” said Mr. Wardlaw.</p>
<p>Nora’s nervous, tentative hand-raising happened almost immediately; even Miss Huckle seemed surprised.</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss Rosen?” she said, calling on Nora without bothering to wait for Mr. Wardlaw.</p>
<p>“It’s the letter <em>m</em>,” said Nora.</p>
<p>“Correct,” said Miss Huckle.</p>
<p>One question later, Seth came to join us in the losers’ area.</p>
<p>Now the members of the Puzzle Club were flabbergasted; they hadn’t expected anyone from outside the club to even show up, let alone beat half of their members. The ones with us in the losers’ area were chattering excitedly under their breath; from what they said, I gathered that Celice was the second-strongest in the club, and that everyone had expected the final battle to come down to her and Tina Branford, the girl with the blonde ponytail and the pink jeans, who was the best in the club.</p>
<p>The Puzzle Club members still in the challengers’ area were quiet, but they were looking around, seeming unsettled. Mr. Wardlaw had his eyes on his desk, and I couldn’t tell if he was in pain or trying not to laugh. Whatever emotion he was feeling, it had made his tie finally leave his chest; it was now flapping in the breeze.</p>
<p>“Mr. Garamonde and Miss Rosen,” said Mr. Wardlaw, his piece of paper with the order of pairings off to the side, forgotten.</p>
<p>Once Nora had defeated Mr. Garamonde, she made to return to the challenger area, but Mr. Wardlaw said, “No, Miss Rosen, please just stay right there. Mr. Magus, please.”</p>
<p>The Puzzle Club members in the spectators area started chattering again.</p>
<p>“Come on, Strago,” Celice intoned. “Show everyone how she’s cheating.”</p>
<p>“Are you kidding?” said Cole. “That girl beat you. D’you think a runt like Strago has a chance?”</p>
<p>“She’s cheating somehow and Strago’s gonna show it!” Celice insisted.</p>
<p>I could see Cora about to say something and start a fight again. I touched Celice on the shoulder. “Celice,” I said. “Please stop accusing my friend of cheating.”</p>
<p>“Well, she is,” Celice insisted.</p>
<p>“I know Nora. She’s an honest person, probably the most honest person I’ve ever met. Her teeth were chattering when we walked down because she was so nervous that she wouldn’t look smart if she failed at these puzzles. She spent the last few days reading puzzle books so she could put on a good show for all of you. And she has. Don’t you think?” I looked around at everyone else for support, both the other Puzzle Club members and my own members. Everyone seemed to be nodding in agreement.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I was just expecting to get another boring contest that would end with Tina beating Celice again,” said Seth Gabbiani.</p>
<p>“I was really impressed when your friend worked out that hot air balloon puzzle,” said Ed Figaro. “I was doing it totally wrong, trying to work out how fast the bag would fall.”</p>
<p>“Me too,” I admitted.</p>
<p>“We don’t usually do anything this hard in club,” said Cyrus Garamonde. “It’s mostly playing with Möbius strips and slide puzzles and working on crosswords. We weren’t ready, but you guys must’ve been even more not ready than us, huh? But your friend still beat all of us.”</p>
<p>Everyone else seemed to agree, but Celice didn’t look convinced, so I said, “Besides, Miss Hanover is one of the judges and she has the Gift of Trickery. Do you really think if there was any cheating going on, she wouldn’t know it?.”</p>
<p>Celice pouted and didn’t answer right away. “Fine, you’re right,” she admitted at last. “Miss Hanover would see if there was any cheating going on. So your friend is really good at puzzles. And you sneaked her in, knowing she’d make fools of us all.”</p>
<p>“We didn’t know,” said Ranta.</p>
<p>“We all thought she was just some idiot who used words no one could understand,” said Cora.</p>
<p>“What’s this ‘we all’? I never thought that!” said Ranta.</p>
<p>“So your friend was a puzzle genius and you had no idea?” said Celice. “You were calling her dumb all this time when she was smarter than any of you?”</p>
<p>“<em>I</em> never called her dumb!” said Ranta.</p>
<p>While the three of them fought, Nora easily defeated Strago on two easy puzzles. Mr. Wardlaw probably watered them down since Strago was, as Cole had said, the runt of the club. But he must have known that easier puzzles would give Nora an even bigger advantage.</p>
<p>With Strago coming to join us in the audience, that left just Tina and Nora. Mr. Wardlaw gestured to Tina that she should come to the battle area, and she did, moving with a calm air to her. She reminded me of a poplar tree: tall, outwardly calm, but with energy and passion inside her. She stopped by Nora’s chair to shake hands before sitting down in her own chair and waiting for Mr. Wardlaw, Miss Hanover, and Miss Huckle to finish a quick, whispered discussion.</p>
<p>“Let’s begin the final round,” said Mr. Wardlaw. He was looking a little disheveled; his perfectly combed hair had started to fall a bit, and there were wrinkles in his shirt from the way he’d been twisting around while Miss Hanover and Miss Huckle took Nora’s responses. I noticed he’d taken off his tie and laid it on the table next to his forgotten sheet of match orderings.</p>
<p>“Your friend is going down,” Celice whispered to me, Cora, and Ranta. “She may be good, but Tina’s the best.”</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s start the final round with a number puzzle,” said Mr. Wardlaw. “A warrior in ancient India once saved the kingdom from a demon. In return, the king offered the warrior anything in the kingdom.</p>
<p>“The warrior told the king that all he wanted was some rice. He asked the king to take a chess board with sixty-four squares. ‘On the first day,’ he told the king, ‘put one grain of rice on the first square. On the second day, put two grains on the second square. On the third day, put four grains on the third square. On each day, put on the next square twice the number of grains which was on the previous square. When each square of the board has a pile of rice, I will take all the grains of rice on the board as my reward.’ The king thought this was a very meager prize. Was he right? Should the warrior have asked for something else?”</p>
<p>Nora and Tina both started working. I could see Nora struggling. It was a numbers thing, which wasn’t her strength.</p>
<p>“Ah, I see. Wardlaw decided to get rid of your friend,” said Celice. “This number stuff is Tina’s specialty.”</p>
<p>“So he’s going to cheat?!” Cora exclaimed.</p>
<p>“No, that must be what he discussed with Miss Hanover and Miss Huckle before he asked the question,” I said. “He knew he was asking a hard number puzzle, and he wanted to clear it with them so they wouldn’t think he was cheating.”</p>
<p>After three minutes, Tina raised her hand and gave the answer. “The king is wrong,” she said. “Based on my calculations, the king will end up owing the warrior about 36,000,000,000,000,000,000 grains of rice. Even if a pound of rice has a million grains in it, that comes out to more than 36 trillion pounds of rice.”</p>
<p>“That’s correct,” said Mr. Wardlaw.</p>
<p>The defeated members of the Puzzle Club gave a whoop, though Ed turned around to say “Nothing against you guys.”</p>
<p>Nora’s face had fallen, and she was looking down at her interwoven fingers again as they wiggled back and forth. Even though she’d done well on all the other puzzles, it seemed like her confidence was falling now that she’d been defeated.</p>
<p>Even though I’d roped her into this to get myself out of trouble, and I’d felt bad about doing it earlier, this had unexpectedly turned out to be a good thing for Nora—she’d discovered something she was good at, and it even looked like she’d impressed Miss Huckle, who was never impressed with anything. Even though there wouldn’t be any shame in losing to the Puzzle Club’s strongest when no one had expected anything out of her, I still felt like I wanted to see Nora win.</p>
<p>So, even though I was risking Miss Huckle’s wrath by making noise, I stood up, moved to the front of the spectator’s area, and cried out to her.</p>
<p>“Nora!” I called. “Don’t lose confidence! She hasn’t won yet!”</p>
<p>“She’s right, Nora!” Ranta joined in. “You can still win this!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, show these dorks you can out-dork the dorkiest of them!” Cora added.</p>
<p>“Down in front!” Miss Huckle barked, and with a squeak I shrank back into my seat.</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell if our words had helped Nora get into the mindset to win, but she did unweave her fingers and look at Miss Hanover, who gave her another smile. It was an encouraging smile, like before, but there was also a mystery to it, like a sphinx’s smile.</p>
<p>“Next puzzle,” said Mr. Wardlaw. “You are working aboard a ship. There are three crates in the hold, one of them labeled ‘Apples’, one labeled ‘Oranges’, and one labeled ‘Apples &amp; Oranges’. Unfortunately, these labels are all wrong. Since the fruit buyers don’t want fruit with finger marks all over it, your job is to choose one crate, take one piece of fruit out of it, and use that to figure out where the labels go.”</p>
<p>Tina didn’t look as confident about this one, and I thought I knew why: this wasn’t something you could just calculate your way through, like she’d done with the grains of rice puzzle. She looked like she was concentrating very hard on it, squirming around in her seat like an earthworm, as if the movements of her body were mirroring the way her mind was working.</p>
<p>Nora stared thoughtfully off into the distance. Tina kept on raising her hand, but before anyone could call on her, she would put it down and start squirming again.</p>
<p>After about two minutes, Tina went to raise her hand again, then lowered it; just as she began to lower her hand, Nora raised her own.</p>
<p>“Miss Rosen?” said Miss Huckle.</p>
<p>“Um, so every single label is wrong, right?” said Nora.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Wardlaw.</p>
<p>“So the crate marked ‘Apples &amp; Oranges’, really, it’s just one or the other, right? Because that label is definitely wrong. So if we get one fruit out of that crate, we know which label goes on it. If we get an orange, we put the ‘Oranges’ label on it, and if we get an apple, we put the ‘Apples’ label.”</p>
<p>“Right so far,” said Miss Huckle.</p>
<p>“So, if we got an orange out of that crate, we put the ‘Oranges’ label on it. Then we have a crate marked ‘Apples’. Since we know that one’s wrong, that crate must really be ‘Apples &amp; Oranges’, because the first crate was ‘Oranges’. Then we know the last crate, the one with no label, must be ‘Apples’.”</p>
<p>“Correct,” said Miss Huckle. “So, we now have Miss Branford with one point and Miss Rosen with one point. The last problem will decide the game. Mr. Wardlaw?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Wardlaw. “The last problem. Let’s say that you come to a pair of doors. One of those doors is guarded by Miss Hanover, and the other by Miss Huckle. Miss Hanover tells you that behind one door is a freezer full of ice cream, and behind the other is a mountain of math homework. She and Miss Huckle both know which door is which; one of them will always tell the truth whenever you ask her a question, and the other one will always lie. You can ask one of them one question to find the door you want. How do you figure out which door is which?”</p>
<p>“I know this one!” said Tina, raising her hand immediately. “Ask Miss Hanover which door Miss Huckle would say has the ice cream behind it. If Miss Hanover is the liar, she’ll say that Miss Huckle would tell me to take the door with the math homework, which will be a lie, because Miss Huckle would be the truth-teller, and she’d show me the right door. And if Miss Hanover is the truth-teller, she’ll <em>still</em> say that Miss Huckle would tell me to take the door with the math homework, because Miss Huckle would be the liar, and Miss Hanover would tell me, truthfully, that she would lie.”</p>
<p>My head was spinning trying to follow that logic. Ranta wasn’t following it either, and Cora had given up and started chasing grasshoppers around the field as they enjoyed the last warm days before autumn. But it looked like Tina had won; she seemed so sure of herself that I didn’t think she could be wrong.</p>
<p>“Except…” Nora began, then stopped and raised her hand.</p>
<p>“Go ahead, Nora,” said Miss Hanover.</p>
<p>“Um, Mr. Wardlaw said originally that Miss Hanover told us that one door had ice cream and the other had math homework. But if Miss Hanover is the liar, then <em>that</em> could be a lie. Maybe both doors are full of math homework. She could even be lying that one of them always tells the truth—maybe they both lie all the time. So I don’t think the question has an answer.”</p>
<p>“Correct. Miss Rosen wins the contest,” said Miss Huckle.</p>
<p>I couldn’t believe it—Nora had won! I jumped out of my seat and ran to her, totally forgetting myself as I threw my arms around her, crying “You won! You won! And you were worried you’d look stupid—you looked smarter than all of us put together!”</p>
<p>Ranta was close behind me, and also gave Nora a hug. Nora looked happy, but also surprised. But her surprise was nothing next to Mr. Wardlaw; he was staring at her with eyes the size of palm leaves, his gaping mouth opening and closing slowly like a big-mouthed bass. Miss Hanover was beaming, and even Miss Huckle was actually smiling.</p>
<p>Once Ranta had released Nora from her hug, Tina came over to shake Nora’s hand. “You beat me fair and square,” she said. “You’re an amazing puzzle solver.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Nora, her cheeks turning red again. “I’m sorry, I didn’t even know I was good at them until today, otherwise…”</p>
<p>“It just shows me I have a lot to learn,” said Tina. She went to rejoin her companions from the Puzzle Club. Celice looked unhappy, but it didn’t seem like she thought Nora was cheating anymore.</p>
<p>Mr. Wardlaw had finally collected himself enough to come around the judge’s table with Miss Hanover and Miss Huckle. “Nice work, kid,” said Miss Huckle. “Look me up when you get to middle school next year. We’ll work on some physics, some differential equations, a little programming. You’ll be a researcher by the time you’re in high school.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Miss Huckle, but I’m hopeless with numbers,” said Nora shyly.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t matter. That’s what computers are for. Ask your friend Lily to show you my office.” She jerked her head at me, and I winced reflexively, causing her to sneer. “Well, I’ve got some work to do. Daniel, Anne, see you later.” She left, heading back towards the middle school building. I could see Nora watch her go, watch how her fuzzy little tail swayed as she walked. I had once wanted to grab that tail and stroke it, just to feel the fur. Now I knew that doing so would be even more dangerous than grabbing a real bear’s tail.</p>
<p>Mr. Wardlaw came forward, his handsome face serious and stern, his appearance more rumpled than I’d ever thought it could be. Nora, Ranta, and I sobered a little, our eyes on him, wondering what he was going to do.</p>
<p>To everyone’s surprise, Mr. Wardlaw sank to his knees on the grass in front of Nora and bowed his head to the dirt. “Please, Miss Rosen, I’m begging you—won’t you join the Puzzle Club?”</p>
<p>“Um, I’m sorry, Mr. Wardlaw, but I can’t,” said Nora. “You see, I already promised Lily I would stay in her club.”</p>
<p>“You can switch if you want, Nora,” I said. “I won’t hold you back.” Though I really wanted to hold her back, really thought it wouldn’t be worth it if I couldn’t come into the clubroom every day and find her on the window seat or at the table, reading, and ask her what she was reading, and hear the excitement in her voice as she talked about it.</p>
<p>Nora shook her head. “No, I love being in this club. If not for this club, I never would have entered this puzzle contest. I’m staying here.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wardlaw stood up, looking deflated, like a sun-dried tomato. “I see. Well, if you change your mind, come and see me.” He went over to the members of the Puzzle Club and directed them to start cleaning up. It seemed that they had dragged the chairs and the tables out here themselves.</p>
<p>Miss Hanover stepped up and put a hand on Nora’s shoulder, her smile as wide as a jack o’ lantern’s. “Good job, Nora,” she said. “I knew you could do it.”</p>
<p>“Miss Hanover,” I said as Cora approached, finally having realized that the contest was over and she could stop chasing grasshoppers. “Since Nora won the puzzle contest, does that mean she gets to end math tutoring? After all, some of those puzzles were math, and Nora did pretty good with them.”</p>
<p>Miss Hanover’s smile didn’t waver at all as she said, “No, Nora, I actually think we should do extra math tutoring. After all, you can obviously do math, so it seems you were just being lazy on your exam.”</p>
<p>Nora looked as deflated as Mr. Wardlaw had a second ago, and Cora looked horrified, possibly because she hadn’t realized Miss Hanover could be so cruel. But I knew Miss Hanover just a little bit better than they did. “Oh, stop being mean,” I said. “Look at poor Nora!”</p>
<p>Miss Hanover chuckled. “You’re right. I’m sorry, Nora. I think you just don’t do well with numbers, but whenever a problem is given in words, you can solve it. You did get all the word problems on your last test right. And I bet you can explain in words why Tina’s answer to the grains of rice problem was correct, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Nora. “Since every pile of rice is twice as large as the last one, not only is the amount of rice getting bigger every day, but the rate that the amount of rice is getting bigger is also getting bigger. The number you double each day is double the number you doubled last time. So the piles of rice get huge really quickly. And then you add them all up, and you’ve got a really really huge pile of rice!” She held her arms up to the sky.</p>
<p>“A really really huge pile!” Cora repeated, also throwing her arms up to the sky.</p>
<p>“Did you catch a really really huge pile of grasshoppers, Cora?” Ranta asked. “Where are they, did you eat them?”</p>
<p>“Shut up, Amaranta!”</p>
<p>Ignoring their usual fighting, I turned to Nora and said, “Should we help them clean up?”</p>
<p>“That’s an easy one,” said Nora.</p>
<h1 id="the-hostage-crisis.-by-ranta.">The hostage crisis. By Ranta.</h1>
<p>Cora and I were rivals long before Nora came to St. Galgani’s. There’s a long story behind how it happened, which I might tell you sometime. But we had been rivals for a long time when Nora came into the picture.</p>
<p>Then Nora showed up, and if anything, Cora and I started to fight even more. Partially, we started to be around each other more often, because we were both in Lily’s club. Cora insisted on being in Lily’s club for some reason, even though I got the feeling that Lily didn’t really like her, and just put up with her so the club would have more members. And even though I had turned down Lily’s invitation to join, I had ended up being a member anyway, because I liked to be around Nora and Lily.</p>
<p>We also started to fight more because Cora was always horrible to Nora, who was my friend. Nora was too nice to do anything, even though she had a streak of smart aleck in her and probably could have destroyed Cora’s mind with a few well-chosen words. But even if Nora and Lily could put up with that, I couldn’t. So I would get angry every time I saw Cora being mean to Nora, and of course, Cora would fight back.</p>
<p>I was relaxing in the clubroom one day with Nora and Lily. Lily had made tea for us and was now watering all the plants. Nora was in the window seat, reading. I was sitting on the sofa, staring off into space and vaguely thinking that the next mile run was coming up and I really ought to be training for it. The mile run was a PE event, so everyone had to do it. The boys, as boys usually do, would get stupid about it and spend the whole run trash-talking and taunting each other. Most of the girls would just walk the course; a few would halfheartedly jog a little before giving up.</p>
<p>It was only Cora and me who really took the run seriously, and even Cora hadn’t, until I started to needle her by quoting my times at her. I couldn’t compete on any of the sports teams, in part because of my Gift of Running, and since the two sixth grade classes, 6-1 (my class) and 6-2 (Cora and Nora’s class) did the run together, it was the closest thing I could get to a sports meet. So I usually trained for it, to make sure I was in top condition to beat Cora again. But today was a lovely day at the end of summer, and all I wanted to do was sit on this couch and watch Lily water and Nora read.</p>
<p>My peace was shattered when Cora stormed into the room. Her hair was still mostly black from when her brother had dyed it, but she had washed it enough that the white parts had started to show through. It looked like her roommate Victoria had given her a break and let her get some sleep; today was the first time in two weeks that Cora didn’t look exhausted, and she had actually brushed her hair and tied it into twin tails.</p>
<p>She threw the door open, banging it against the wall and surprising Lily into dropping her watering can. Her tail swished angrily from right to left and her ears were flat back against her head as she marched up to the window seat and yanked aside the curtain, revealing Nora, who was still absorbed in her book. “Hey! What was that?” Cora demanded.</p>
<p>“What was what?” Nora asked.</p>
<p>“You made me look stupid in math tutoring! I struggled with that problem for an hour, and then Miss Hanover asked you, and you just answered it!”</p>
<p>“It was only about two minutes, really,” said Nora.</p>
<p>“That’s not the problem! You made me look like an idiot!”</p>
<p>“You don’t need any help with that,” I snapped, standing up from the couch to confront Cora.</p>
<p>“Stay out of this! This is none of your business!”</p>
<p>“When you yell at my friend and blame her for your own stupidity, it’s my business,” I said. “Don’t blame Nora just because you thought the two of you were equally dumb at math, and she proved in that puzzle contest that she’s smarter than you at that too.”</p>
<p>“That’s not the real problem here! She made me look bad!”</p>
<p>“You’re making yourself look bad right now.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t me who said that, but Lily. She had picked up her watering can and mopped up the water with a dish towel, and was now staring at Cora coldly, the empty watering can held up like a gun. I had never seen her blue eyes look so icy.</p>
<p>“You’re damaging the clubroom,” said Lily, pointing the watering can at the door, “and you’re berating other members, and your yelling is disturbing the plants. Please stop.”</p>
<p>Cora’s cat ears immediately stood up, and her tail began swishing right to left. She lowered her face. “I’m sorry, Lily,” she said, her voice suddenly humble.</p>
<p>“I’m not the one who needs an apology,” said Lily, although she was more angry than I’d ever seen her.</p>
<p>Cora seemed to have a hard time deciding who to apologize to. Not because she didn’t know who deserved one, I thought. But she would never apologize to me for anything, and apologizing to the plants would look crazy. So she settled on Nora. She turned towards the window seat, her eyes clenched shut, and said, “I’m sorry, Nora. It was wrong of me.”</p>
<p>Nora smiled, not without satisfaction, and said, “That’s okay. I forgive you, Cora.” I could hear Cora grinding her teeth.</p>
<p>I didn’t know if Lily was planning to ask Cora for any other gesture of apology, but if so, she never go the chance; we were interrupted by the entrance of a small, black-haired girl, whose large eyes and quick, jerky movements reminded me of a Chihuahua. She came in through the still-open door, clutching an envelope.</p>
<p>I felt my lip curl with distaste. She was Amy, one of Cora’s entourage from Class 6-2. She was always following Cora, Mikaela, Leah, Gracie, and the other popular girls from Class 6-2, sucking up to them, buying them drinks and snacks, and laughing at their jokes, even the ones that weren’t funny. <em>Especially</em> the ones that weren’t funny; she laughed twice as hard at those.</p>
<p>I had thought she must be there to see Cora, but she seemed surprised when she saw Cora, and even more surprised when she saw Nora. She turned away from them and turned to me instead, holding out the envelope. I took it, and without a word, she left the room.</p>
<p>“What was that about?” said Cora. “Weird.”</p>
<p>I opened the envelope. There was a letter inside, which I unfolded and read.</p>
<p><em>Ranta,</em> <em>Throw the next mile run, or else.</em></p>
<p>There was no signature.</p>
<p>“Or else what?” I demanded from Cora.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Don’t play dumb.” I shoved the letter at her.</p>
<p>“You think I wrote this? I wouldn’t threaten you! Besides, if I don’t win the mile run on my own, I’ll never prove that I’m better than you and you aren’t so great just because you’re rich. This is the sort of thing some rich girl who thinks she’s so great because she’s rich would do to win. How do we know you didn’t send that letter to yourself?”</p>
<p>“If I needed a reason to be mad at you, I could think of lots of them without resorting to something like this,” I shot back.</p>
<p>Nora had come down from her window seat to look at the letter. “Cora didn’t write this,” she announced.</p>
<p>“Hah! See? Even your best friend Nora says I didn’t write it!” said Cora.</p>
<p>I felt a little bit annoyed at Nora, but I knew she must have a good reason to think so. “Why do you say that?” I asked.</p>
<p>“This isn’t her handwriting. See this cursive <em>x</em>? Cora’s <em>x</em> is straight. Um, I’ve been helping her with her reading homework, so I’ve seen a lot of her handwriting lately,” Nora explained. “There’s the <em>x</em>, and see how this <em>o</em> starts at the bottom and comes over? Cora starts her <em>o</em>s at the top and goes under. Half the time she doesn’t finish going under, and it looks like a <em>u</em>.”</p>
<p>She could have had one of her servants write it, but I believed what Cora had said earlier. This didn’t seem like her style. She was petty and annoying and blamed other people for her own mistakes, but she had never used underhanded tactics like making threats.</p>
<p>Cora’s ears were plastered against her head again, and she looked like she was braced for my next attack, but I turned away from her and sat down on the sofa again. “Well, I’m just going to ignore it,” I said. “If those idiots can’t even bother to tell me what they’re going to do if I don’t throw the run, I can’t bother to care.”</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>After that, I forgot about the letter and whoever had written it. It might have been in the back of my mind over the next few days, though, because I didn’t train nearly as hard as I usually did for the mile run. I spent a lot of time sitting around on the sofa in the clubroom, basking in the sunlight, watching Nora read and sometimes climbing into the window seat to read with her. We spent one day doing a reading of a scene from <em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em>, with Nora playing Jack and me playing Algernon, and Lily watching. I had fun making Lily crack up laughing when I read some of Algie’s ridiculous lines about inventing constantly ill friends in the countryside, and never once did I feel a pang of guilt because I wasn’t training for the mile run.</p>
<p>The day of the run soon came. On normal days, I had to be at my classroom by 8:45, but the mile run was at nine, so I had some extra time. Usually, on a mile run day, I would have gotten up early anyway so I could eat an early breakfast and get warmed up, but today I barely cared. I slept in until eight, then dragged myself out of bed and sauntered over to the breakfast hall.</p>
<p>Cora was off in a corner with a bunch of her groupies, and I didn’t see Nora anywhere, but Lily was by herself, so I got my breakfast and joined her. “Have you seen Nora?” she asked me.</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t see her,” I said. “She’s probably at the library, stuck in a book, with no idea how long she’s been there.”</p>
<p>“Maybe. I’m a little bit worried,” Lily confessed. “It doesn’t feel right if she’s not here.” She laughed. “Isn’t that strange? We didn’t even know each other a month ago, but it already feels wrong if she’s not at my side.”</p>
<p>I sort of understood what Lily was saying, but I didn’t think there was anything to worry about.</p>
<p>“What are you up to this morning?” I asked Lily.</p>
<p>“Working in the garden. The last harvest of crab-apples has started growing in its claws, so I’ve got to go and stop them from turning each other into crab-apple juice.”</p>
<p>“Does that mean we’ll be having crab-apple cake soon?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Hopefully” said Lily. “Maybe I’ll keep some for myself, and you and Nora and I can go over to the home ec rooms at the high school and make our own. Do you cook at all?”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” I said truthfully, “but I’m willing to learn. What about you?”</p>
<p>“I used to cook for my brothers and sisters,” Lily said.</p>
<p>By the time I finished my breakfast, it was almost 8:30, so I had just enough time to go to my room and change into my running clothes and get over to the track where we’d be doing the run. I said goodbye to Lily and went off to get changed.</p>
<p>It was a fine morning for a run, I noticed as I made my way down to the track, after changing into a pair of shorts and a T-shirt in my dorm room. The sun was high already, but a cool wind blew through the grounds, perfect to stop me from sweating and let me keep in water as I ran.</p>
<p>I reached the track at 8:40. Most of the sixth grade was already there, standing around the starting line in a loose crowd. Ms. Rutherford and Mr. Woodbury, the boys’ PE teacher, were checking their watches and tapping their feet and checking to make sure everyone was here. When Ms. Rutherford saw me coming, she marked my name off on her clipboard and gestured me towards the crowd.</p>
<p>I saw Cora standing with a group of her servants near the bleachers. The group looked much smaller than usual; I only saw Sweta, Mikaela, and Cora herself. When they saw me, Cora scowled, and Sweta broke away from the group and began moving towards Ms. Rutherford.</p>
<p>“Hey, Ranta!” Jill, one of my friends from Class 6-1, came up behind me and slapped me on the shoulder. It stung, but I still smiled at her. Jill was tall, standing half a head above me, with long legs and straw-colored hair tied back in a ponytail, lanky and yellow like a cheetah. She was a good runner, probably next-best in the sixth grade after Cora and me. She had even beaten Cora a few times at sports meets, and that was before she’d shot up like one of Lily’s Hu Mung sprouts.</p>
<p>“Are you gonna get under five minutes this time?” Jill asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. I slacked off on training this time,” I said. From the look of her, no one could say the same for Jill. She looked more fit than ever, more catlike than even Cora.</p>
<p>“Well, at least you’ll beat Cora, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Probably. I didn’t think I’d slacked off badly enough that Cora could beat me.</p>
<p>At that moment, Sweta reappeared, coming up behind me just like Jill had. “Ranta,” she said. “I’ve got a message for you. From the Fiorentino family.”</p>
<p>“Cora’s last try at making me scared? Don’t waste my time,” I said.</p>
<p>“Cora’s got nothing to do with this. It’s about your little friend, the teacher’s pet, Nora,” said Sweta.</p>
<p>“What about her?”</p>
<p>“We got her.”</p>
<p>I stared at her. “What do you mean you’ve ‘got her’?”</p>
<p>“I mean we grabbed her this morning and locked her up, and if you don’t want something bad to happen to her, you better throw this run,” said Sweta, trying to look threatening, but Jill, half a head taller than me and a whole head above Sweta, glared at her, and Sweta quailed and shrank back.</p>
<p>That must have been why Nora wasn’t at breakfast this morning. I grabbed Sweta by the shirt. “Where is she?” I demanded, shaking her.</p>
<p>“I-I don’t know! They never told me, just so you couldn’t squeeze it outta me,” Sweta said. “But if you don’t throw the run, she’s not gonna like what happens.”</p>
<p>“What’re you gonna do, tickle her feet?” Jill scoffed.</p>
<p>“Have you ever seen Mrs. Smith’s folk sing-alongs?” said Sweta. “They used to bring us up to the auditorium every month, first thing in the morning. That was before the seats were put in. We’d sit on the concrete floor for two hours while Mrs. Smith played her guitar and sang and the other teachers circled around with whips and cracked anybody who didn’t sing along.” Sweta tried to sneer, but shrank back at another glare from Jill.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Smith retired,” I said.</p>
<p>“That’s right. But someone took videos of all of them. Every single folk sing-along, stored on video. And we just happened to get hold of those videos. So if you don’t throw this run, Ranta, your little teacher’s pet friend gets to see every folk sing-along ever. All twenty-nine hours of ‘Froggy Went A-Courtin’ and ‘Bre’er Rabbit’s Carrot Patch’ and all the others, with no breaks, sitting on a concrete floor!”</p>
<p>Rage surged within me, rage I hadn’t felt even when the hermit in the woods had been threatening to suck all the bottled water out of Nora. “What kind of sadistic creature are you?!” I demanded, raising my fist to smite Sweta.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, before I could smite Sweta, Ms. Rutherford noticed. “Ranta! No fighting! I don’t care what she said. Get to the starting line, it’s almost time for the run to begin.”</p>
<p>Gritting my teeth, I let Sweta go. With a smug grin, she went back towards Cora.</p>
<p>“I have to find her. I have to help her,” I said.</p>
<p>“The run’s about to start,” said Jill. “If you leave now, you’ll be giving them what they want.”</p>
<p>“I can’t leave Nora to that! She’s my friend, and—”</p>
<p>“Then let me go,” said Jill. “I’ll find her.”</p>
<p>“No, I know this is important to you too—”</p>
<p>“It is, but I have track meets. You don’t have anything but this.”</p>
<p>I watched Cora moving up to the starting line, her eyes on me. She didn’t look smug or confident, though. She didn’t look nervous either. She looked as she always did, her scowl the same as ever. I didn’t think she was involved in Nora’s kidnapping. But if she was, I would find out.</p>
<p>“I know who can save Nora,” I said. “She’s Nora’s best friend, even better than me. And she’s right over there.” I pointed across the grounds, towards the wrought iron fence surrounding the garden.</p>
<p>“You’d better hurry,” said Jill.</p>
<p>“Who do you think you’re talking to?”</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I raced off, even as the mile run was getting ready to start, and headed for the garden. I knew that Lily would be in her little hidden corner, behind the high hedge guarded by Turk’s Cap lilies, where she kept all the strange plants her gift had let her grow, like the crab-apples.</p>
<p>I made my way past the flower crown vines and the peppy mint and the strawberry sunflower, into the fruit orchard at the northwest corner, running past it all, never pausing to admire the beauty or strangeness of these plants. I found Lily in the fruit orchard, a burlap sack in one hand, a garden trowel in the other, chasing around the crab-apples which had grown their legs and claws and cut themselves down, beneath a tree of crab-apples whose legs and claws were still half-formed stumps.</p>
<p>“Ranta,” said Lily when she saw me, stopping her chase. The crab-apple she’d been after scuttled up to her and pinched her on the leg, through her sock. Lily yelled and stabbed it with the trowel, then threw the remains in her sack. “What are you doing here?” she asked, turning back to me. “The run is about to start, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“It’s Nora. Those cowards—those idiots—those—!” I was so angry that I couldn’t even think of a name bad enough for Sweta, Amy, and the others who had taken Nora hostage.</p>
<p>“Calm down. Who did it, and what did they do?”</p>
<p>“Those slaves of Cora who sent me that letter last week, the one telling me to throw the mile run. They captured Nora and took her somewhere. They told me if I don’t throw the run, they’re going to make her watch the videos of Mrs. Smith’s folk sing-alongs! Sitting on a concrete floor!”</p>
<p>Lily whistled. “You did the right thing, coming to me,” she said. “You need to go win the run.”</p>
<p>“What about you? Can you find her?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’ll find her,” said Lily. “She’s somewhere with a concrete floor, right? There aren’t many places like that in the elementary school. I’ll find them. And when I do, I’ll show them who they’re messing with.”</p>
<p>“What are you going to do to them?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I’m going to show them some of the things I grow in my garden, that’s all. Just go win the run.”</p>
<p>The look on Lily’s face when she said that scared me. She was smiling, but it was the most terrible smile I had ever seen, like she’d gone crazy.</p>
<h1 id="the-cat-girls-mafia.-by-nora.">The cat girl’s mafia. By Nora.</h1>
<p>I had never known her name until the morning of the run, when she came to deceive me and lead me into the Fiorentino family’s trap.</p>
<p>I had seen her in class and the dining hall, a girl with black hair, so tiny she could have been a third-grader, her quick movements and her hunched posture and her large eyes giving the impression of a ground squirrel. She was usually with Leah, Gracie, Willow, Greta, and Sweta, who were all part of Cora’s group, when Cora wanted a group. But Cora often didn’t want a group. She was as prickly with the other girls as she was with me, I had noticed, but when they annoyed her, she would leave them to be alone; when I annoyed her, she would yell at me.</p>
<p>She was like Grima Wormtongue, I had decided. None of the other girls, including Cora, seemed to like her. She would float around the edge of the group, ignored and left out of the talk, until someone mentioned being hungry or thirsty or tired. Then she would be off to get snacks or drinks or to carry a bag back to the dormitory. She would sometimes pipe up to agree with something that one of the other girls had said, but they would just ignore or insult her. I had once thought of trying to talk to her, to offer to be a real friend who wouldn’t ask to be waited on, but after Cora turned down my offer of friendship, it was hard for me to talk to anyone out of the blue like that. So I never did, and I’d stopped thinking about her at all once I became friends with Lily and Ranta.</p>
<p>But that morning, she came to me.</p>
<p>Outside my dorm room, as I was leaving to head down for breakfast.</p>
<p>I was surprised to find her waiting for me in the hall, her large eyes darting left and right, her tiny hands clutching a book to her chest, dressed all in black from hair t0 skirt, from tights to shoes. The sunlight coming through the window behind her shone yellow through the folds of her long, cloak-like shirt. “Hi…Nora,” she said nervously when I appeared.</p>
<p>“Oh…hi. Do I know you?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I guess not. I-I’m Amy. From your class. I guess we’ve never really talked, have we?” She smiled shyly.</p>
<p>“Um, I guess not,” I said.</p>
<p>“Actually, this is kind of embarrassing. I read this book. And I wanted to talk about it with someone, but none of the other girls read books. And then I thought of you…” She trailed off. “I know you read a lot. And I was wondering if maybe you’d read this? And maybe we could talk about it?” She held the book out to me.</p>
<p>It was a book called <em>Horror High: Ghoul Power</em>. It was part of a series about girls who were the children of monsters from old horror movies. There was a vampire girl named Draculicious; a ghost girl named Ghostricia; an ice sorceress named Frostina; and a pair of werewolf sisters, Werewolfina Sr. and Werewolfina Jr. There were more of them, but those were the main ones. I had read some of the books, but to be honest, I hadn’t liked them very much. Too much of it was about clothes and boyfriends and other things I didn’t care about.</p>
<p>But I knew what it was like having no one to talk about books with. I had gone for two months at the start of the year without talking about books to anyone. As much as I liked Lily, I couldn’t talk about books very much even with her. She was so nice that she would listen to me talk all day long, and sometimes she would have something to say back, but it wasn’t until I met Ranta that I’d had anyone to talk about books with here at St. Galgani’s.</p>
<p>So I smiled at Amy and handed <em>Horror High</em> back to her. “I have read some of these, and I’d be happy to talk about them with you,” I said.</p>
<p>“Oh, thank you! But, listen, my reputation would be ruined if anyone saw us talking, especially about books. So can we talk in the basement?”</p>
<p>I tensed up. That didn’t seem right. Everyone liked Ranta, and people saw her talking to me about books all the time. “What’s wrong with the library or the dining hall?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. It’s just, you know how Willow and Greta and Sweta get about you. I’d like to stay friends with them <em>and</em> become friends with you. It’s just temporary, until they get used to it.” She tried to smile again, but I didn’t smile back. If that was how Amy felt, I didn’t think we would ever be friends. But I wasn’t going to be the one who said so. My father always said <em>Friendship cuts two ways, but someone needs to make the first cut.</em> So I would make the first cut, and leave it to Amy whether she wanted to make the second one.</p>
<p>“All right,” I said. “We can talk in the basement.”</p>
<p>We left the soft carpets and white walls of the living area and went down a flight of metal steps, the kind on ships, with holes in them, and ridges so your shoes don’t slip when the steps are covered in oil. I had never been down here, but Amy seemed to know the way.</p>
<p>“It’s dark in here,” I commented as we came to the bottom of the steps. “Are you sure you don’t want to talk somewhere else? My clubroom is probably empty right now, and it’s nice and bright in there.”</p>
<p>“No, this is fine with me,” said Amy.</p>
<p>We had come to some kind of control room. The walls and floor were concrete, the former lined with wires and switches that I thought were probably circuit breakers. The only light came from a utility lantern hung above us, a bulb in an open orange plastic cage.</p>
<p>Amy led the way across the control room to a big, heavy door of black metal. “This is the command center,” she said. “We can talk in here.”</p>
<p>I felt a breeze, and turned around just in time to see I was surrounded. Greta, Willow, Leah, Gracie, all of Amy’s group, all the ones she’d been so afraid would see her, had been hiding under the stairs, shrouded in darkness, waiting for her. They were all smiling, for some reason.</p>
<p>“At least, you can talk,” said Amy. “You’ll tell us everything you know. And then you’ll scream.”</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was around that time, as they brought me into the command center and locked the door behind them, that I remembered Amy coming to the clubroom to deliver that letter to Ranta, demanding that she throw the mile run and let Cora win, or else. This must be the ‘or else’.</p>
<p>Amy didn’t stick around, but the other girls took me into the dim room, lined with rolling office chairs and cluttered with folding tables stacked with papers, and locked the door, and Greta commanded me to sit on the concrete floor. “I’m fine,” I said. “I don’t mind standing.”</p>
<p>“Sit, or we’ll break your knees!” Willow snapped, startling me. I sat.</p>
<p>“We’re the Fiorentino family,” said Greta as Leah and Gracie dragged out a TV on a rolling stand. “We’re Cora’s family, and family looks out for each other. We’re here to make sure Cora beats Ranta in the mile run. For her honor, and ours.”</p>
<p>“Also, we bet all of our savings on her,” said Gracie.</p>
<p>“We don’t much like you, teacher’s pet,” said Willow, “but for some reason, Ranta does, so we took you hostage to make sure she takes a dive.”</p>
<p>“We talk about books together,” I said,</p>
<p>The four of them exchanged dumbstruck stares. “Ranta <em>reads</em>?” Willow asked incredulously. “She’s good at sports, popular, rich…and she <em>reads</em>?”</p>
<p>“That has to be a lie,” said Greta. “She’s making it up.”</p>
<p>“More people have gotten rich and popular by reading than by being illiterate,” I pointed out. “Look at Oscar Wilde. He was rich and popular, and he loved to read. Look at Barack Obama. He likes to read, and he’s rich, and so popular he even became the president. Albert Einstein was rich and popular. JK Rowling is rich and popular.”</p>
<p>“Shut up! That’s a lie! No one liked any of those people!” Greta shouted. “They were all bookworms and teacher’s pets like you, and everyone hated them!”</p>
<p>“I’ve never heard of any of them,” said Willow.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter, it’s all lies!” said Greta. “Ranta does not read! She’s nothing to Ranta. She’s just Ranta’s version of Amy, a teacher’s pet who sucks up to Ranta to get attention!”</p>
<p>“Anyway, we took you because Ranta likes you, so we knew she’d give up the run for you,” said Leah. “But no one else likes you, so no one’ll be coming after us once this is over, like if we’d taken one of Ranta’s other friends. But I’m warning you—if Ranta doesn’t let Cora win, you’re in for it.”</p>
<p>“What am I in for?” I asked.</p>
<p>“If Ranta doesn’t throw the run, then we’ll make you sit there on that concrete floor and watch—this,” said Greta. She held up a video cassette. “The best of Mrs. Smith’s folk sing-alongs.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Smith’s folk sing-alongs were before my time, but I could tell from the looks on the girls’ faces that it was something I wouldn’t enjoy watching very much. I didn’t mind the concrete floor as much as they seemed to think, though. I spent a lot of my time sitting on floors, windowsills, and stairs, reading, so maybe I was more used to hard, uncomfortable surfaces than they were.</p>
<p>“But in the meantime,” Greta added, “until we hear back from Amy and Sweta about whether Ranta chose to throw you under the bus or not, we’re going to torture you and make you talk.”</p>
<p>“About what?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Whatever!” said Leah, tossing her auburn curls with a self-satisfied air. I wasn’t sure what she was so satisfied with herself for.</p>
<p>“Pacifically, we want to know just why you and Ranta always seem to be hanging around Cora these days,” said Greta. “After all, she’s our friend, and we have a right to know whether you losers are blackmailing her to hang out with you.”</p>
<p>This seemed like a bad time to tell Greta that it was actually ‘specifically’, not ‘pacifically’, unless she had actually meant that she peacefully wanted to know. Then she was a liar, since this kidnapping wasn’t pacific at all. But they had been very specific about why they’d chosen me to kidnap.</p>
<p>“Cora and I and Ranta are all in the same club,” I said. “We’re in Lily’s Helping Hands. That’s why she’s always with Ranta and me after school.”</p>
<p>A shocked gasp filled the room, as all four girls suddenly sucked their breaths in as one. “There’s no way Cora would join a club with <em>you</em> in it,” said Willow.</p>
<p>“She’ll tell you so if you ask her,” I said.</p>
<p>“Why would she do that? What’s so great about this club that would make Cora join it and ignore us after school every day?” Greta demanded.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know for sure, but I think she really wanted to become friends with our club president,” I said.</p>
<p>“Your president is…?” Leah asked.</p>
<p>“Lily van Rossum, from the middle school,” I said.</p>
<p>The four members of the Fiorentino family shared a mutual stare of bemusement, and they left me alone while they went into the corner to confer. I noticed that I could easily leave the room now that all of their backs were turned, but to be honest, I really hadn’t wanted to do the mile run. A lot of the girls would walk the course and not even pretend to take it seriously, but I wouldn’t feel right doing that, so I always ran. I would run for about a quarter mile before I couldn’t go any further, and then I’d walk, huffing and puffing, until I recovered enough to run a little more. Then I’d run another twenty or thirty feet, and then I’d walk again. I’d repeat that until I came to the end, exhausted, sweaty, and not very far ahead of those who’d given up and walked. I always felt like everyone was sniggering at me; the people who were good at running would snigger because I was so bad at it, and the people who gave up would snigger because I wasn’t smart enough to give up like they had. So far, the worst thing the Fiorentino family had done was show why I’d been right to never try and make friends with Amy.</p>
<p>But worse was to come. The four girls finished their conference and came to surround me, looking angry. “We’ve decided we don’t believe you,” said Leah. “Lily van Rossum is a teacher’s pet and a weirdo who likes science and eats boogers. And she’s a ledinquet who skips class to go in the garden and roll in the dirt like a pig. There’s no way Cora would want to be friends with her.”</p>
<p>“That means you’re threatening Cora,” said Greta. “There’s no way she’d hang out with bookworms and booger eaters and dirt rollers like you. And when you threaten Cora, you threaten Cora’s family.”</p>
<p>“That’s why we aren’t gonna wait until we find out if Ranta threw the race,” said Gracie. “We’re just gonna show you the video now.”</p>
<p>I really wanted to tell Leah that it was “delinquent”, not “ledinquet”, which sounded like a French cheese.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It wasn’t as bad as they made it sound. Mrs. Smith didn’t have a great voice, and she couldn’t do much more with her acoustic guitar than strum it in time with the song, but some of the songs were kind of fun, and before the song, she would talk a little about the people who wrote it and first sang it, which I thought was interesting. Afterward, she’d explain what some of the harder words meant. Leah and Greta should probably have paid more attention to that part.</p>
<p>I sat cross-legged on the concrete floor while the four members of the Fiorentino family surrounded me, making sure I didn’t run. They seemed to have trouble standing their ground, though. After an hour and half, Willow had to go kneel in the corner with her fingers in her ears, going “Blah blah blah blah!”to drown out the folk songs now rolling through her head. After two hours, Gracie screamed that she couldn’t take any more and ran out of the room. That left just Greta and Leah guarding me.</p>
<p>After two and a quarter hours, I started to get a little tired of the folk sing-along, and the concrete floor started to get a little uncomfortable, but I was obviously doing better than my three guards. Willow was still in the corner, her fingers in her ears, now singing the hip-hop-inspired theme of the <em>Horror High</em> cartoon at the top of her voice. Greta kept on asking Leah if the race was over yet, and Leah kept snapping that she didn’t know and if Greta wanted to leave so bad, she should just cut and run like Gracie or go join Willow in the corner.</p>
<p>After two and three-quarters hours, Greta couldn’t take it anymore. “She’s not cracking like Amy said,” she complained. “I don’t get it. We all died after two hours of the folk sing-along. Why isn’t she dying?!”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” said Leah, “but Sweta should have been back by now. Since she’s not here, Ranta must have done something to her. I’ve had enough of this. It’s time to finish this.”</p>
<p>“What’re you gonna do?” Greta asked.</p>
<p>“<em>We’re</em> going to kill her,” said Leah. “Socially.”</p>
<p>She went to the corner and got her hot pink vinyl purse. A quick movement, a dip of the hand inside, and between her fingers were a lipstick, a mascara, and an applying brush. Another dip, and in her other hand appeared a compact. “Smile, Nora Rosen,” Leah said, her perfect white teeth flashing in a shark-like grin. “You’re getting a makeover.”</p>
<p>“If we’re giving her a makeover, can I turn this off?” Greta asked. Without waiting for an answer, she hit the button, and the television flickered off. Willow hadn’t noticed and stayed in the corner with her fingers in her ears. “Hey, Willow. Get over here, we’re giving the teacher’s pet a makeover.” Willow didn’t reply. “Willow!” Greta said again. “WILLOW!”</p>
<p>“Forget her,” said Leah. “Bring me that chair.”</p>
<p>Greta brought one of the rolling office chairs that the girls had pushed off to the side. She grabbed me by the arm and pulled, and I stood up and sat in it. “It’s better if you don’t fight,” she said. “There’s a reason they call Leah the Mad Makeover Queen: she can make or break your reputation with one flick of her brush.”</p>
<p>Nothing could break my reputation any more than it already was, so I didn’t really care what Leah did to me with her makeup brush. Besides, if I did fight, it was still two against one—three against one if Willow came out of the corner—and Greta, at least, was faster and stronger than I was.</p>
<p>Leah took a makeup cape from her purse and tossed it to Greta, who wrapped it around my shoulders. She then opened a lipstick and twisted the end, exposing half an inch of pale pink. Her lips twisted into a sneer, and she gave her auburn curls another shake before she started advancing on me, like a mad doctor advancing on a victim with a syringe full of evil medicine.</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door.</p>
<p>“Greta, go answer that,” said Leah. “Maybe it’s Sweta.”</p>
<p>Greta went to answer the door. She stood up on her toes and looked through the peephole to see who it was. “It’s Amy,” she said.</p>
<p>“Good! Let her in. We can give her a makeover too, as a reward for making us sit through three hours of Mrs. Smith’s folk sing-along,” said Leah.</p>
<p>Greta opened the door. “Amy, you idiot! You said she would crack after—”</p>
<p>Amy collapsed as soon as the door opened, falling on her face into the room and blocking the door open. The person behind Amy stepped over her and faced a speechless Greta, tossing a long blonde braid over her shoulder. “Amy told me where you where,” she said. “Then she had to take a nap.”</p>
<p>Lily had come to rescue me.</p>
<p>Before Greta could do anything, Lily whipped out a honeysquirtle gunblossom and let Greta have it. Two pounds of sticky, gummy, yellow nectar splattered over Greta, covering her from head to foot and tangling up her arms and legs. Lily threw the spent gunblossom at Greta, knocking her off balance and sending her toppling to the floor next to Amy.</p>
<p>“Stay back, van Rossum!” Leah cried. “I have a lipstick on your friend here!”</p>
<p>Lily’s right hand plunged into the pocket of her overalls, and then, in a flash, came out again, hurling a shuriken thistle at the lipstick in Leah’s hand. The lipstick clattered to the concrete floor. Leah’s left hand went to her purse and came out with a mascara; Lily’s left hand went into her pocket and came out with a handful of foxtail darts. One of the darts hit Leah’s hand and made her drop the mascara. The others stuck in her white Eagle Aardvark blouse, which she’d been showing off the other day. Now it was ruined; she’d never get those foxtail darts out without leaving holes.</p>
<p>Lily reached behind her back and took out the birch switch she’d stuck through the belt loops of her overalls. It was a very fine birch switch, very swishy and thin, with a nice snap to it. It made me think of the switch that Benjamin Bunny’s father had just happened to be carrying when he found Benjamin and his friend Peter Rabbit in Mr. MacGregor’s garden. Lily flicked it three times, brandishing it like a rapier, and Leah stepped back, raising her hands. “Stop it!” she shrieked. “I’ll tell the teacher if you hit me!”</p>
<p>Lily hit her anyway, thwacking the switch across her shins. Leah ran from the room in tears, trampling Greta and Amy and getting sticky gunk all over her Happy Girl shoes as she went.</p>
<p>“Are you all right?” Lily asked, offering me a hand.</p>
<p>I took it, stood up, and nodded. “I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“Was she part of this?” Lily asked, pointing her birch switch at Willow, who was still kneeling in the corner with her fingers in her ears, and had started making sounds like a monkey.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>
<p>Lily went over to Willow and cracked her across the calves with the birch switch. “Oww!” Willow squealed. “What’s the—” She turned around and saw Lily. “Oh…hi. Who are you?”</p>
<p>“I am vengeance! I am the night! By your powers combined! Ally to good! Nightmare to you! Soldier of love and peace, Warden of the West, Protector of the Forest! For the tree whose name you bear, I will punish you!” Lily declared, and she thwacked Willow a few more times.</p>
<p>I had no idea Lily could be such a ham.</p>
<p>Unlike Leah, Willow didn’t run away; she just held up her hands, feebly trying to defend herself as the birch switch struck her. Lily gave her one more for good measure, and then sent her off.</p>
<p>“How did you find me?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Ranta came and told me what was happening. She knew they had you somewhere with a concrete floor, and I thought they probably had you somewhere in the elementary school, since the place would be empty with everyone over at the run. So I came over and started looking for people who should have been at the run, but weren’t. And I found her.” Lily pointed her birch switch at Amy, snoozing on the floor next to the struggling Greta. “A little valerian <em>verité</em> and she was sleeptalking the whole plan.”</p>
<p>Greta made a noise like a rhinocerous stubbing its toe. “Amy! I knew this was all her fault!”</p>
<p>“It is, but not in the way you think,” said Lily. “Come on, Nora. Let’s go to the clubroom and have some tea. Ranta’s there too. The run is over, and she beat Cora. Cora’s sulking in her dormitory.”</p>
<p>“Wait! You can’t leave me like this!” Greta cried.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, it’ll dissolve over the next four hours or so,” said Lily. “Until then, let me put something on for you.” She turned on the TV, and put Mrs. Smith’s folk sing-along back on.</p>
<p>We stepped over the sleeping Amy and Greta, who was screaming and crying that we couldn’t do this to her over the strumming of an acoustic guitar,, and left.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Ranta was at the table, still in her shorts and T-shirt and sweaty from the run. She stood up when she saw me, and came over and pulled me into a hug. “I’m so glad you’re all right,” she said. “Those cowards—they didn’t make you watch that video, did they?”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t that bad,” I said. “It hurt them more than it hurt me.”</p>
<p>Lily made chicory and roasted barley tea and served me and Ranta. We drank tea in silence for a few minutes before I asked. “Lily, what did you mean when you told Greta it was Amy’s fault, but not in the way she thought?”</p>
<p>Lily set her teacup down on the saucer and turned her clear blue eyes on me. “Nora, you’ve seen Amy in class, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said.</p>
<p>“What does she usually do when she’s with her friends?”</p>
<p>“She stands outside the group and laughs at all the jokes, and buys everyone drinks and snacks, and carries everyone’s bags,” I said.</p>
<p>“And how do they treat her?”</p>
<p>“Whenever she talks, they ignore her. Or else they say something mean to her.”</p>
<p>“Does it make sense to you that she would go to this much trouble so Cora could beat Ranta?”</p>
<p>It didn’t. I’d never seen Cora be as mean to Amy as Leah or Greta or Sweta, but I’d never seen her be nice either. “No,” I said. “I think Amy just stays with them because she’s afraid to have no friends. Like me.”</p>
<p>Lily smiled. It was a peaceful smile, as if her mind could be at rest now that we’d cleared that up. “It was a setup from the beginning,” she told Ranta. “Amy knew you’d never throw the race. But she was the only one who did. She told the rest of them—Leah, Gracie, Willow, Greta, Sweta—that if they held Nora hostage, they could get you to let Cora win. If you ever told Cora what they did, they could just say you were mad that you lost.</p>
<p>“But that wasn’t the real reason why she came up with the plan. Her real goal was to get revenge on those girls who ignored her or insulted her, without letting them know it. The plan would fail, and they would suffer, but Amy could just pretend to be an idiot who came up with a bad plan, and things could go back to how they were.”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” I said. “Amy came up with the plan to lock me in and show me the folk sing-along video. She told them I would crack. But Amy didn’t care if I cracked or not, did she? She knew they would crack, and that was all she cared about.”</p>
<p>“But how did you figure this out, Lily?” Ranta asked.</p>
<p>“When I asked Amy what time the video was supposed to start, she said it had already started…and then she mumbled ‘They should all be cracking right about now’. Not <em>she should be</em>—<em>they should all be</em>. That made me think she wanted her friends to crack too, not just Nora. And now I know why.”</p>
<p>“But I don’t understand,” I said. “If she doesn’t like what they’re doing, why doesn’t she just leave them? There must be someone who would be nice to her, somewhere in this school. She doesn’t have to get revenge on them.”</p>
<p>“I understand why she did it,” said Lily. “That’s why I didn’t punish her too much. But she used my best friend as a disposable tool, so I couldn’t let her get off scot-free, either. That’s why I told Greta what I did.”</p>
<p>I looked down into the bottom of my teacup. “Maybe it’s a good thing,” I said.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Ranta asked.</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s a good thing that Lily told Greta. Maybe Greta will figure it out, and maybe they’ll shut Amy out of their group. Then she can find a new friend, one who’ll be nice to her. Even Amy deserves that.”</p>
<p>Lily got out of her chair, came around behind me, and wrapped her arms around me, resting her chin on the top of my head. “You’re so nice, Nora,” she said. “You deserve this.”</p>
<p>Ranta was smiling too. “I wouldn’t count on Greta figuring out anything, though, with her brain,” she said.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I was nervous when I came into the classroom the next day, especially when I saw that Miss Hanover hadn’t come yet. Greta, Sweta, Leah, Willow, and Gracie were all clustered around Cora’s desk, and they were all glaring at me. Amy, on the other hand, was not with them; she had her head down on her desk, her face buried in her arms, as if she were asleep.</p>
<p>I tried not to look at them and just go to my own desk. I set down my bag and leaned down to get out my book. When I sat up again, they were all around my desk—Leah, her auburn curls shaking with anger, a lipstick already in her hand; Gracie, the hint of an embarrassed blush barely visible on her dark skin; Greta and Sweta, both looking brutish and squash-faced like a pair of angry boars; and Willow, whose eyes were darting around nervously as if she expected Lily to burst in and thwack her with a birch switch again.</p>
<p>“Wh-what is it?” I asked, opening my book and pretending to start reading.</p>
<p>“You know what it is,” said Greta, grabbing my book. “You think you can make fools of the Fiorentino family? Think we’re a bunch of clowns, here to make you laugh?”</p>
<p>“You thought wrong,” said Sweta.</p>
<p>“I n-never thought that,” I stammered.</p>
<p>“I thought something,” said Gracie. “I thought we should tear a page out of this book until this runty teacher’s pet begs for mercy.” She took the book from Greta and pinched the edge of a page between her fingers, prepared to rip into it.</p>
<p>“Stop, that’s a library book,” I protested. “Come on, can’t we—can’t we just forget anything ever happened? I won’t tell anyone.”</p>
<p>“But we want you to tell,” said Leah. “We want you to tell everyone what happens when you mess with the Fiorentino family. And we want you to tell your dirt-eating friend Lily that we’re coming for her.” She brandished her lipstick to strengthen her point. “Gracie, rip the book.”</p>
<p>“Gracie, don’t rip that book!” Cora yelled from the door of the classroom. She ran towards us, jumping over the desks as if they were hurdles on the track, her twin tails flying out behind her like streamers on bicycle handlebars, and her claws flashed, and Gracie dropped the book, her hand clutched around the scratches on her wrist.</p>
<p>“Cora, we’re doing this for you!” Gracie insisted.</p>
<p>“That’s right! This runt ruined our plan to make Ranta throw the race!” said Leah.</p>
<p>“I know what happened,” Cora snarled, her fangs bared, her ears back, her tail flicking to and fro. “Amy told me. You guys are idiots! Did you really think I wanted to beat Ranta like that?”</p>
<p>“You weren’t supposed to know,” said Willow, shooting a dirty look at Amy.</p>
<p>“Why are you defending this teacher’s pet?” Leah asked, facing Cora and bringing herself up to her full height. Leah was one of the taller girls in class, and Cora was one of the shortest, so she had to crane her neck to look upwards into Leah’s eyes.</p>
<p>“She’s annoying and dumb-looking and she can’t talk right and she’s a flailing freak,” said Cora. “But she helped me. I passed my makeup reading test. Now I don’t have to do after-school tutoring. All thanks to her.”</p>
<p>“But she’s an enemy of the Fiorentino family!” Sweta insisted.</p>
<p>“If you’re really my family, then you’ll listen to my orders,” said Cora, crossing her arms and scowling at Sweta. “And my orders are to leave Nora alone. She’s under my protection. Anyone who does anything bad to Nora gets to go head-first into the dumpster in the alley behind the dining room.”</p>
<p>Leah looked horrified, and the rest of them seemed to get the message. They slowly moved away, back to their knot around Cora’s desk. Cora took off her glasses and started cleaning them on the edge of her shirt.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I said.</p>
<p>“Don’t think this makes us friends,” said Cora, scowling. “But you did help me. And Lily asked me to make sure they didn’t come after you.” She left to join the Fiorentino family around her desk.</p>
<p>I got up to retrieve my book from the floor where it had fallen. As I stood up, I happened to catch sight of Amy, who was staring at Cora and the Fiorentino family from her desk. Amy had told the Fiorentino family that no one cared about me except Ranta, who would be too busy at the run to rescue me. She’d been wrong. I hoped that someday, Amy would also have a friend like Lily who would stand up for her when she was in trouble.</p>
<h1 id="alone-with-lily-by-cora.">Alone with Lily… By Cora.</h1>
<p>I told Nora a story about why I want to become better friends with Lily, which you might have heard. Nora, that porridge head, seemed to buy it. It wasn’t a lie, really, but it wasn’t the whole truth.</p>
<p>The story I told the porridge head was that Lily helped me apologize to my fourth-grade teacher, Mr. Grayson, after I flipped out, threw a book at the window, and ran out of the classroom. And that did happen, but don’t tell me you didn’t wonder why a little thing like that had me still bringing Lily cake and pretending to like Nora and Ranta just to be around her, even two years later.</p>
<p>Mr. Grayson is a nutjob. The whole school knows it. Only three people I know of around here are nuttier than him. One is Mr. Wardlaw, that math freak who declared Nora a national wonder because she solved a few stupid puzzles. The other two are Mr. Grayson’s twin daughters, Asha and Elma Grayson. Like father, like daughter.</p>
<p>I’d try to explain Asha and Elma Grayson to you, but I wouldn’t be able to. Words can’t express how crazy those two are. Everyone calls them the Wooden Girls. Not that that explains anything. I didn’t even understand why they were called that until Lily explained it to me—it’s because ash and elm are trees, and their names are <em>Ash</em>a and <em>Elm</em>a.</p>
<p>I think it’s also because trying to fight those two is like fighting a couple of trees. Asha has the Gift of Might, so her punches are like a tree falling on you, and Elma has the Gift of Swift Healing, so attacking her is about as effective as attacking a tree trunk. They were also as deaf as trees, when I tried to explain what really happened. It’s like fighting two angry trees, that chase you until you drop dead from tiredness, then beat you up.</p>
<p>But they never did beat me up, and it’s all thanks to Lily. You could say she saved me from a couple of nutjobs so crazy they make their father look like Miss Hanover. And I never even thanked her for it. I never asked her to be my friend, like Nora asked me that day. I never gave her the chance to shoot me down, to tell me that she had lots of cool friends over at the middle school and didn’t need some little kid cramping her style.</p>
<p>I was finally going to do it that day. I brought her cake, hoping she’d take pity on me and let me down easy. I walked over to the clubroom with my head full of dreams that she <em>wouldn’t</em> shoot me down, that we’d become friends and I could spend every day around the bravest, most honorable person I’ve ever known.</p>
<p>I came in and found Nora.</p>
<p>That was the biggest disappointment of my life. Somehow, that little porridge-headed schizoid had done in two months what I hadn’t been able to do in two years; not only had she asked Lily to be her friend, Lily had actually said yes.</p>
<p>In a way, though, she’d done me a favor. When Lily asked her to join the club, I spoke up and asked to join too, and now I had an excuse to be around Lily every day. But we hardly ever got to be alone—usually Ranta or Nora was around too. If Nora was around, I couldn’t talk to Lily because she would focus all her attention on Nora. It was impossible to get any peace with Ranta around; she would start some fight with me, and I wouldn’t have the chance to talk with Lily.</p>
<p>But I got lucky one afternoon. Lily, Nora, and I were sitting in the clubroom drinking tea. It was still nice and sunny, but a cool wind was blowing across the grounds, so I had gone to my room after class and changed out of my shorts and T-shirt into a skirt and tights. I sat drinking my tea, watching Nora read and Lily water the plants, as always, wishing Nora and the plants would both disappear and I could be alone with Lily.</p>
<p>I set the cup on the saucer and glanced at Nora’s book. Funny, she was reading <em>Horror High</em>. Amy, one of the girls from class, liked to read those, but they didn’t seem like Nora’s kind of book. One thing Nora and I agreed on was that obsessing over clothes and boyfriends was stupid. Plus, she usually only read books written by dead people. Maybe some of those dead authors had become undead, and had kids at Horror High.</p>
<p>I was about to ask her why she was reading it, just to have something to do, when the door opened and Ranta came in. “Afternoon, everyone,” she said. Lily put down the watering can and went to get tea for her, but Ranta shook her head. “Actually, I’m going right back out. The bookstore from town is having a book fair over at the high school. I just came to see if anyone wanted to come along.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I do!” said Nora immediately, shutting <em>Horror High</em> and putting it in her bag. “Lily, is it all right if I leave my bag here?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Lily. Ranta left her bag too, placing it under the table alongside Nora’s.</p>
<p>“I’ll pass,” I said. “The last thing I need today is more farging books.”</p>
<p>“Pretty much what I expected from a cretin like you. Lily?”</p>
<p>“No, but you two have fun,” said Lily. “If you see your brother, tell him hello for me.”</p>
<p>Ranta made a face, but said she would, and she and Nora left.</p>
<p>I’d make a face too, if my brother was named Aurelio Reyes and made costumes for the theater club. He sounded like a fluttery wuss. Luckily, my brother Lucian is awesome, even if he can be the world’s biggest jerk.</p>
<p>I sipped my tea again for a moment after Ranta and Nora had left, wondering what to do now that I couldn’t even watch Nora read, when I realized that Lily and I were now alone in the room. All of a sudden, I felt tense. There was a catch in my chest, and my hands started shaking so badly that I put the saucer back on the table.</p>
<p>Lily, on the other hand, was going back to her watering as if nothing had happened. She got the small stool that Miss Hanover had found for her from the corner and stood on it to water the climbing vines. There were little alcoves all around the upper walls of this room, with shelves in front of them. I didn’t know what they were really for, but Lily had put plants in most of them, and some of the plants had reached their vines all the way across the white ceiling and started twisting their tendrils around the light fixtures.</p>
<p>“Those two are such peas in a pod,” Lily commented as she put down her watering can to move to the next alcove. “It makes me feel left out sometimes.”</p>
<p>“You’ve got your middle school friends,” I said. I paused, feeling like a lump of oatmeal was stuck in my throat. “And—”</p>
<p>I was about to say <em>And me</em>, but Lily looked at me, something strange in her eyes, and I suddenly felt even more uncomfortable. I took off my glasses and started polishing them, just to have an excuse not to meet her gaze anymore.</p>
<p>She turned away again, going back to her watering with a preoccupied air. Once I couldn’t pretend my glasses needed to be cleaner anymore, I set them down on the table.</p>
<p>“Um, Lily, so, what do you think of this outfit?” I asked, standing up to show her my clothes. I wasn’t much of a clothes shopper, but I liked to dress up around Lily. She was so graceful and elegant that she even made her gardening overalls look like high fashion; I couldn’t match that, but at least I could look decent.</p>
<p>Lily glanced quickly over her shoulder from her perch on the stool. “It suits you,” she said.</p>
<p>I could feel my cheeks turning red. “Th-thank you,” I stammered, as tongue-tied as Nora.</p>
<p>“But the most important thing is what you think,” Lily added, turning her eyes back to the flowerpot in the alcove. “Do you prefer to dress like this? Or do you prefer to wear your T-shirt and shorts?”</p>
<p>“Mostly I like to wear clothes that’re easy to move in,” I admitted. “And it’s nice if I don’t have to care whether I get dirty. But also, everyone in class kind of expects me to dress like that. I’ve been doing it since third grade, so that’s just how they all see me.”</p>
<p>“I see,” said Lily.</p>
<p>I sat down again, feeling awkward. I shouldn’t have done that. But I’d been dressing up for Lily ever since I’d joined the club, and she’d never seemed to notice.</p>
<p>A few more minutes passed in strained silence, feeling like a few hours. I finished my tea, now mostly room temperature, and fiddled with the spoon next to the sugar dish, coated with a crust of sugar that had stuck to the wet spoon after it had gone into the tea, then back into the sugar dish.</p>
<p>This was my chance, I knew. I could finally apologize to Lily for getting the Wooden Girls mad at her, and ask her to be my friend.</p>
<p>The only problem was, I couldn’t.</p>
<p>I settled for finishing off Nora’s half-empty cup of tea. What? Being a porridge head isn’t contagious.</p>
<p>Lily finally finished her watering, put the stool back in the corner, and came over to the table to have a cup of tea. I watched her pour herself a cup, add a tiny amount of cream, and skip the sugar, as she always did. She concentrated on her cup, acting as if I weren’t there.</p>
<p>I went to speak, but my tongue felt like it was stuck to the roof of my mouth. I managed to crack my lips and unstick my tongue, and the following words came out.</p>
<p>“Um. So. Have you. Um. Seen the Wooden Girls recently?”</p>
<p>A look of distaste crossed Lily’s face, then passed. “No. Well, they’re always making a spectacle of themselves. Asha destroyed a priceless marble statue the other day, while chasing down someone who shoplifted from the high school convenience store. But they haven’t bothered me at all recently.”</p>
<p>“Oh. That’s—that’s good. Um, listen, about back then—I mean, I really…really don’t know what I’m trying to say.”</p>
<p>Lily shrugged. “The Wooden Girls are popular, but they don’t really decide who’s popular and who’s not. They’re too busy with their hero of justice game for that. And they haven’t bothered me at all since Mr. Grayson explained things to them.”</p>
<p>She went back to her tea, looking even more preoccupied than before. Even though she said the Wooden Girls hadn’t bothered her, it seemed like she didn’t like talking about them. I had to come up with something else to talk about so she wouldn’t have to think about them.</p>
<p>“Um, so, I made a pretty nice save in PE the other day, when we were playing soccer,” I mentioned.</p>
<p>“Oh, really.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Mikaela was coming at me, and she’s on the soccer team, so everyone thought I was done for. But I surprised her and got the ball away from her, just as she was going to shoot at our goalie.”</p>
<p>“How nice for you.” Lily didn’t seem to care. Of course she didn’t; here I was just rambling on and on about myself. Anyone would be bored, especially someone who didn’t even like sports, like Lily.</p>
<p>“Um, so how have you been sleeping?” I asked. I took off my glasses and started polishing them on my skirt. I could feel my tail twitching back and forth nervously through the gap in the chair where the back met the seat.</p>
<p>“Fine. What about you? Is your roommate still keeping you awake at night?”</p>
<p>I winced. “Sometimes. Victoria’s not so bad, but I got kinda tired of listening to her sing opera, especially early in the morning on weekends, when I’m trying to sleep in. So I got the record player to drown her out, and she got pretty mad at me. But she’s mostly calmed down now.” I’d had one last go at drowning her out; I’d asked Nora for advice on making a Victoria-proof record player, and Nora had suggested I put vibration dampeners on it so it wouldn’t shake itself apart. My new megramophone had survived Victoria’s old standbys “I Cannot Be Drowned Out By Cora’s Brother’s Old Record Player” and “I Cannot Be Drowned Out By the Record Player Cora Bought at the High School Store”, but she had written a new song, “I Cannot Be Drowned Out By Cora’s Megramophone That She Had The New Girl Build For Her”, which had destroyed my megramophone just as my last two record players had been destroyed.</p>
<p>“Do you have a roommate?” I asked Lily, trying to keep the conversation going now that it was flowing a little bit.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Lily.</p>
<p>“You get it, then. Nora and Ranta both live alone, so they don’t really understand how it is when you have a roommate. What’s she like?”</p>
<p>“Her name is Alexis, and I’d rather not talk about her,” said Lily.</p>
<p>“Does that mean you don’t get along with her?” I asked, foolishly, but not as foolish as what I was about to say. “I don’t know how that’s possible. You’re the easiest person in the world to get along with. I’d like to claw anyone who doesn’t get along with you.”</p>
<p>Lily’s expression grew cold, and she set down her teacup. “I wish it was that simple,” she said, standing abruptly. “I’m going. Tell Nora and Ranta when they get back.”</p>
<p>“Oh…okay,” I said. “See you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Lily gathered her things and left, not even bothering to put her garden trowel in her satchel, and leaving me totally confused. Obviously, I made her mad, but I couldn’t figure out how. I would’ve expected her to get mad at me when I brought up the Wooden Girls, but if anything, she’d tried to make me feel better about the whole thing. Or maybe she was mad about the Wooden Girls, but it was my idiotic babbling afterwards that made her mad enough to want to leave.</p>
<p>Either way, I’d missed my golden opportunity. Lily and I still weren’t friends, and I still hadn’t thanked her for what she’d done for me.</p>
<p>I felt my eyes getting wet. This was nothing to cry over. I hadn’t cried for two years, and I didn’t want to break my record now. I wasn’t really crying. My eyes got a little wet, and for a second I felt that sinking in my chest that always came before I cried, but I didn’t cry, not really.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to look at this room or my teacup anymore, and I definitely didn’t want to see Lily’s abandoned teacup on the table, so in the end, I crawled up into the window seat and drew the curtains. I laid there with my head on the cushions, staring at the sky, and waited until Nora and Ranta came back.</p>
<p>At first, they didn’t notice me, and I thought about trying to hide. But those curtains were too easy to see through. It had never worked for Nora, and I didn’t expect it to work any better for me. So I sat up and opened the curtains, just to show them I was here, and kept my eyes on the sky.</p>
<p>“Where’s Lily?” Ranta asked.</p>
<p>“She left,” I said.</p>
<p>“Where’d she go?” Nora asked.</p>
<p>“How should I know? She probably got bored waiting for you guys to come back from that stupid book fair, you took forever!” I yanked the curtains all the way open and stood up, suddenly angry. Ranta looked surprised, and Nora was twitching and jittering for some reason. Both were holding brown paper bags that I assumed were full of dumb books.</p>
<p>I stomped past Nora and Ranta, stopping with my hand on the doorknob to say, “Anyway, I guarded your stupid stuff until you came back. You’re welcome.”. I stormed out the door, slamming it shut behind me, and headed back to a dorm room full of opera music.</p>
<h1 id="my-brother-embarrasses-me.-by-ranta.">My Brother Embarrasses Me. By Ranta.</h1>
<p>I wasn’t happy at all when I found out that Lily knew my brother. I usually try to make sure my friends don’t know about him. But since Lily knew him already, it was only a matter of time before Nora met him too. Worst of all, if Nora and Lily had both met him, that probably would mean Cora would meet him. Then I would have to die. I couldn’t go on living if Cora knew my brother.</p>
<p>My brother, Aurelio Julio Octavio Mahal de los Reyes III. Just look at his name—no one with a name like that could possibly be normal. When we were young, my parents used to get me dolls for Christmas and my birthday. Rel was more into the dolls than I was. I would play with them for a while, then get bored, and they would end up in the toybox in the playroom. Then Rel would take them, and he’d dress them up and put them in poses and comb their hair, and he’d spend his allowance buying new clothes and accessories for them. He used to watch the daytime talk shows and soap operas, and he’d act them out with his dolls—the story of the woman who came to the TV psychiatrist because her husband loved the dog more than her; the talk show panel discussion on why men lie; the soap opera plot where the hero’s evil twin brother tied him up and married his fiancée in his place; all of them were reenacted in our playroom by Rel, using the dolls that were supposed to be mine.</p>
<p>When I first started at St. Galgani’s, I sometimes went over to his room to see him when I got lonely. We were both in the elementary school then, so I just had to go to another wing of the dormitory. After he moved up to middle school, I went over there a few times to see him too. But ever since he’d gone into high school last year, I had stopped going to see him. I didn’t want anyone—even the teachers—to know we were related. And for that reason, I also hardly ever went over to the high school’s little shopping center.</p>
<p>But that afternoon, as I was going over to the clubroom, I saw a poster hanging on the fence around one of the planter boxes. The picture showed a pair of theater masks, the happy and sad masks surrounded by a ribbon, above an opened book, the pages fluttering in the wind. Amatus Books, one of the bookstores in the town, was holding a book fair in the high school shopping center, today and tomorrow from noon to five. I decided to stop by the clubroom and see if anyone wanted to come with me; I’d been looking for something new to read, and Nora was always looking for new books—that girl seemed to eat through books the way a sheep eats through grass.</p>
<p>I went upstairs to the clubroom and found Lily, Cora, and Nora. Lily was watering her plants, as always; Nora was reading, as always; and Cora was sitting around scowling, polishing her glasses, and staring off into space, as always. When she saw me come in, Lily put down her watering can and went to get tea for me. “Two creams, a drop of honey, right?” she asked.</p>
<p>“We spend too much time in here drinking tea, for you to remember that,” I said with a laugh, but I gratefully accepted the cup of black tea she set out for me, sitting down at the table across from Nora. I glanced at Nora’s book. <em>Horror High: Totes Terrified!</em>, it was called. I was surprised to see her reading something like that. I had never read any of those books, so I didn’t really know what they were like, but from what I’d heard, they weren’t Nora’s usual fare.</p>
<p>After I’d finished my tea, I announced, “Sorry to run out so fast, but there’s a book fair over at the high school, and I thought I’d go check it out. Anyone want to come?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I do!” said Nora immediately, shutting <em>Horror High: Totes Terrible!</em> and putting it in her bag. “Lily, is it all right if I leave my bag here?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Lily.</p>
<p>“Me too?” I asked, and Lily nodded.</p>
<p>“I’ll pass,” Cora growled in her usual rude way. “The last thing I need in my day is more frogging books.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t really inviting you anyway. I know someone who can’t read has no use for books,” I said, and Cora snarled at me. “Lily, what about you?”</p>
<p>“No, but you two have fun,” said Lily. “If you see Rel, tell him hello from me.”</p>
<p>I really hoped I wouldn’t see Rel. Now that she’d reminded me of the danger lurking over at the high school, I almost didn’t want to go. But now that I’d invited Nora, it was too late to back out. “I will,” I said. “See you later.”</p>
<p>“Bye,” said Nora.</p>
<p>We left the clubroom and took the back staircase out of the office building, coming out in the old courtyard. The old courtyard was hardly ever used for anything, so no one bothered to keep it looking nice. In the newer courtyards, the planter boxes and wrought iron trellises were overgrown with flowers and climbing vines. The old courtyard’s planter boxes were bare dirt in some places, and choked with weeds in others. Some of the paving stones were carpeted year-round with green moss, and blades of grass were shooting up in the cracks between them.</p>
<p>I led Nora across to the back gates. Even though no one bothered to keep the old courtyard nice, the back gates were always open during the day. I thought the teachers probably used them to leave and go home in the evening, since they were so close to the office building. Otherwise they would have had to walk all the way across the elementary school campus to the front gates.</p>
<p>I pushed aside the black iron bars and Nora and I left the old courtyard’s cobblestone, down a short stone staircase to the paved sidewalk that would bring us to the high school. Trees lined each side of the path—oak, elm, birch, beech, and others, their fallen leaves dancing away with each gust of wind.</p>
<p>“Have you ever been to Amatus Books?” I asked Nora as we set off down the footpath, the rolling green fields of the campus on either side of us.</p>
<p>“No, I’ve never visited town before,” said Nora.</p>
<p>“They almost went out of business a few years ago, but the school stepped in to help. Every few months, they pass out order forms so we can get books delivered right to the dormitory,” I said. “Sometimes, you can win coupons for free books at school events. I get one every time I finish the mile run.”</p>
<p>“In that case, maybe I should have tried to get away from the Fiorentino family so I could run in it,” said Nora.</p>
<p>“That’s all right, there’ll be another one soon,” I said. “Besides, you can also get them for high scores on your tests, or winning the spelling bee, or helping out with chores.”</p>
<p>Nora hadn’t been punished for missing the mile run after Lily and I had explained the situation to Miss Hanover, but Cora’s friends had been given extra cleaning in the dorm. It seemed like Cora herself hadn’t gotten in trouble. I probably would have had her screaming in my face if she had.</p>
<p>We talked about what kinds of books we wanted to look for at the book fair the rest of the way to the high school. The elementary school had a high fence all around it, and the middle school had a fence around its main parts—the dormitory, the classrooms, and the office buildings—but there was no fence around the high school. It was the biggest of the three schools at St. Galgani’s, with the most students, and all the buildings that everyone shared were there: the amphitheater, the assembly hall where each semester’s opening and closing ceremonies were held, the reception area where parents and guests from other schools were entertained on field days and open house days. As Nora and I approached, the first thing we saw was the clock tower, its pointed steeple poking above the rest of the buildings in the cobblestone square surrounded by shops and cafes.</p>
<p>“That clock tower always makes me think of Big Ben,” Nora commented as we came closer.</p>
<p>“The real Big Ben is a lot taller,” I said. “Maybe this summer, you and Lily can come with me to London and we can see it.”</p>
<p>“Wow, could we?” said Nora.</p>
<p>“Sure. I’ll ask my parents.” That was one of the few things I liked about having rich parents: you could always find some way to show your friends a good time. But no one ever believed you’d earned anything yourself when your parents were rich; they always thought you’d bought it somehow. Cora was always acting like my parents being rich had something to do with beating her at the mile run. That was one of the many things I hated about having rich parents.</p>
<p>We passed under the clock tower and came to where the pavement met the cobblestones. The people from Amatus Books had set up stalls and tables all around the square, all flying flags and banners bearing the theater masks and open book logo of the store, and all piled high with books. I saw dusty old copies of Charles Dickens and Jane Austen alongside the glossy covers of <em>Horror High</em> and <em>Fab Fairies</em> and <em>My First Boyfriend is a Werewolf!</em>. Another table nearby was covered with boring adult books about lawyers and grown-up romance; Nora had instinctively steered away from that one, and I followed her gladly.</p>
<p>Most of the people here were high school students, and some teachers, although I did see a few elementary and middle school students. Some were looking at books, and others had finished their shopping and were sitting at the outdoor tables at the restaurants and cafes, reading or talking to friends. Nora drifted through them towards a table of classic poetry, and I followed her. We spent some time looking through Shakespeare and Keats and Robert Frost, then drifted on to a table of plays and musicals, and more Shakespeare, and Oscar Wilde, and George Bernard Shaw, and Gilbert and Sullivan. “I wish I had more money,” Nora said, taking out her wallet. “I’d buy the whole fair. But I only have enough here for one or two books.”</p>
<p>“Since it’s you, even if you bought the whole fair, you’d still be back in the library sometime next week looking for more books,” I said, and Nora laughed. She went over to a stack of plays by lesser-known playwrights, and as I followed her, I caught sight of me.</p>
<p>Well, that’s going a little far. He was taller, and his hair was longer than mine, and tied into a ponytail at the back. But it was the same dark brown as mine, and had the same frizziness. His skin was the same brown as mine, and his eyes the same deep violet, and we had the same long, thin arms and legs. My uncle had said over and over that we looked enough alike to be twins, even though we were five years apart.</p>
<p>And there he was, browsing the crafts books, two stalls down. I hoped I didn’t share his delicate, fluttery hand movements as he turned the pages of a big book of brocading techniques, or that ridiculous way he swayed his hips when he walked, but I had a terrible feeling I did. As usual, his clothes were outrageous: a black Chinese shirt with white angel wings embroidered across the breasts, and a pair of jeans so tight they looked painted on, also with white angel wings stitched across the back pockets and down his calves.</p>
<p>It might be only a matter of time before Nora met him, but I wanted it to be a matter of more time than this, so I put my hand on Nora’s shoulder and whispered, “Let’s go over there”, pointing across the square.</p>
<p>“Huh? Okay, but is something wrong?” Nora asked.</p>
<p>“No, I just think we’ll find better stuff over there,” I whispered back. I turned her away and guided her around a shelf of huge leather-bound books, where I thought he wouldn’t be able to see us, and ran right into him.</p>
<p>“Good morrow, dear sister!”</p>
<p>There he was, advancing on us with his usual dopey smile, purposely flashing his perfect, straight white teeth. We’d walked right into his trap. Somehow, he’d seen us, and managed to appear behind this shelf and cut off our escape. Well, I was pretty sure he’d managed to appear behind the shelf thanks to his Gift. My brother has the Gift of Instant Movement. He can disappear from one place and reappear in another.</p>
<p>“Hi, Rel,” I grumbled.</p>
<p>“A most adorable adolescent! Alone the Fertile Crescent!” my brother exclaimed, turning on Nora. “I must embrace you!”</p>
<p>“Please don’t,” I begged him, but Rel ignored me and grabbed Nora into a grandmotherly hug, squeezing her close. Nora tried to step back, but Rel was holding on too tightly for her to move. Nora waved her arms like a drowning person trying to claw up to the surface, but Rel ignored her and pinched her cheeks with his long, thin fingers.</p>
<p>“That’s enough!” I insisted, and I pried his arms off of Nora. While I held his wrists so he couldn’t move, Nora ran behind me and hid.</p>
<p>“Prithee release me, sister, for I wished only to enclose her in my arms, to touch her silken hair against my tender cheek, the crowning jewel of my week, and I must insist your indulgence,” my brother declaimed, trying feebly to free himself from my grip.</p>
<p>“No! Can’t you see she doesn’t like it?”</p>
<p>“For such a cutie, to be hugged is a duty! Ah, sweet one, come, your mission of goodwill from your land of clouds and cotton candy awaits thee in my arms!”</p>
<p>“Save your nutty statements for play rehearsals!” I struggled with him, pulling his wrists together. Suddenly, he disappeared, and I stumbled forward, my shoes hitting the cobblestone hard. I spun around and saw Rel next to Nora, on one knee.</p>
<p>“Come on, just a little more, little one that I adore,” said Rel, reaching for Nora, who pulled away and came to hide behind me again. Suddenly Rel was also behind me again. I spun around, and Nora followed, her hands on my shoulders, holding me in front of her like a shield.</p>
<p>“No!” I said. “If you try to hug Nora again, I’m going to yell for the police.”</p>
<p>“Alas, I must. Alackaday. Won’t you come out, my honeycomb? My word I shan’t embrace you again,” said Rel, speaking over my shoulder to Nora.</p>
<p>Nora shook her head fiercely. “You wound my heart. Is there no price? Not even the written word?” my brother asked. “Leave my sister’s iron wall, upon my word I’ll lay not a finger on you, but shall gift you coffee, and any book at this fair, if you come and sit by me.”</p>
<p>I felt Nora perk up. She was clearly weighing the reward of a cup of coffee and a book against the risk of being hugged and squeezed and named George by my fruitcake of a brother. I heaved a sigh. “We should probably just go with him, Nora,” I said. “He’ll never leave us alone, and as you saw, he can teleport, so we can’t get away. Even if I ran, I couldn’t escape.” I was stronger than Rel, but he could overcome that with his teleportation too, so we weren’t going to get away now that he’d seen us.</p>
<p>“…Just don’t come too close,” said Nora.</p>
<p>Rel clapped his hands and squealed with delight, as if she’d just asked him to be best friends. “Come, uncommon coffee awaits yonder,” he said, leading the way across the square towards one of the cafes.</p>
<p>We took an outdoor table at Cafe Soeur underneath its wooden sign painted with the emblem of a young blonde girl in pigtails and an apron dress. The sign made me think of Lily, and I remembered that Lily knew my brother somehow.</p>
<p>Rel ordered three coffees from the waitress, a dark-haired and bright-eyed high school student in the shop’s uniform of slacks and waistcoat. He also asked if she would bring a basket of the leftover croissants from the morning. When she’d gone, he turned his gaze on me. “Wh-what?” I asked.</p>
<p>“How have you been? You never come to see me anymore, so I never know how you’re doing,” said Rel, dropping his theater-speak.</p>
<p>“Fine.”</p>
<p>“But alas, the truth I’d most like to espy, is, where’d you find this cutie pie?” said Rel, holding his arms out at Nora. Nora cringed, but held her seat, and Rel kept his promise not to hug her again.</p>
<p>“Don’t scare her anymore! And her name is Nora, not ‘honey’ or ‘cutie pie’. You’re objectifying her, you idiot.”</p>
<p>“Do you even know what that word means?” Rel asked, with an irritating smile.</p>
<p>“It’s where your idiot brother scares your friend by calling her weird things and getting all touchy-feely. And I met her through Lily. Do you know her?”</p>
<p>“Of course I know that adorable little gardener girl!” Rel squealed. “The club needed some flowers for a performance last year, so I asked around and found out that she tends the garden. She got me the most perfect bouquet for the love scene in <em>Nancy’s Secret</em>.”</p>
<p>“She asked me to say hi if we saw you,” I said. “I was hoping we wouldn’t see you, but since we did, there, I said it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, be not in revolt, sister,” said Rel. “Mom already thinks you’ve become a monster. Last summer, upon the veranda stood we, and quoth the mother, ‘Aurelio, your sister is turning into a monster. I’m at my wits’ end.‘And quoth the son, ’Mom, she’s always been one; doth the beast know not its own cub?’ But I told her I would try talking you out of your monstrosity.”</p>
<p>“Well, you’ve tried,” I said. “You’ve failed.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be that way. You used to be so cute. Remember how we used to play together? I made you that Phantom of the Opera costume, remember? You ran around in that cape for months. What became of her, sister? Wherefore art thou thus?”</p>
<p>“That was—!” I glanced at Nora and saw that she was staring down at her hands on the table, her eyes hidden behind her bangs. Maybe it was better if I distracted Rel so he wouldn’t bother Nora.</p>
<p>“That was a long time ago,” I said. “I’m not the same as I was back then.”</p>
<p>“And you never come to see me anymore, you used to come so often, even my roommate knew you.”</p>
<p>“I’m busy. I don’t have time to come all the way over here. Besides, they don’t like to let girls in the boys’ dormitory over here, right?”</p>
<p>“You’re my sister. You don’t count.”</p>
<p>“How nice, I don’t count as a girl,” I said.</p>
<p>There was a strained silence as I stared at Rel across the table with my most withering glare, and he stared at me with his best sad puppy dog eyes, and Nora stared at her hands, doing her best to fade from existence. I was glad that the waitress brought our coffee then. She set down a cup and saucer in front of each of us and put the basket of croissants in the center of the table, along with a dish of butter.</p>
<p>“Merci beaucoup,” said Rel. “That’s French,” he added to me and Nora after the waitress had gone.</p>
<p>“I think we know that, thank you very much,” I replied, doing my best to put on the snooty kind of voice that adults use with people they don’t like.</p>
<p>“<em>Vrai? Tu parles français? Très bien!</em>”</p>
<p>I drank my coffee and tried to pretend that Rel wasn’t there. I figured that was the best way to make him go away. Rel, for once, kept his mouth shut and let me ignore him. He buttered a croissant and ate it one flake at a time, savoring every nibble. Rel barely ate anything. When he did eat, he took forever to finish. That was the only way he could stay so skinny when he never exercised.</p>
<p>Once my coffee cup was about half drained, I turned to Nora and said, “So, have you seen anything you like yet?”</p>
<p>Nora blinked three times. Not three times, one then two then three. She blinked three times in the same span it takes most people to blink once. Then she did it again. Six blinks, in the same span it takes most people to blink twice.</p>
<p>When she talked, her words came three times as fast as usual too. “They had <em>The Tempest</em> at that table we were at I’ve never read it it looked interesting I might get that.” Her hands shook as she reached for a croissant and the butter dish. I looked over and saw that her coffee was mostly gone.</p>
<p>“Oh, <em>The Tempest</em>!” said Rel. “Do you like plays, dear honey? Do they please thy sweet soul? Stroke thy spirit?”</p>
<p>“Yes I do like plays especially comedies my parents used to take me to see Shakespeare at the college where my dad works sometimes we saw <em>Twelfth Night</em> one time and I think <em>Othello</em> another time I always had fun,” said Nora. She looked down at her hands for a moment. “I think maybe the coffee is getting to me I don’t know if I’ve ever had this much caffeine before.”</p>
<p>“It looks like a light roast,” I said, looking down into my cup. “Even more caffeine than normal coffee.”</p>
<p>“Worry not, dear honey, your adorability surfeits with your caffeinated exploits!” Rel declaimed, reaching a hand skyward. I thought he just wanted to do something dramatic, but Nora thought he was grabbing at her again. She jerked back, her chair popping off the plaza from the force of her movement and sliding across the cobblestones.</p>
<p>“Ho ho ho!” Rel boomed, so loud that half the courtyard turned their heads to look at him. “If coffee be the fuel of cute, drink on, give me excess of it, so that, surfeiting, mine appetite shall grow and kill me. And now exeunt all the cafe, and let us shop!”</p>
<p>I left my half-drunk coffee on the table and went with Rel and Nora back towards the book stalls. On our walk over, I’d slowed down a little so Nora could keep up. Now she raced ahead of me, flitting from stack to stack like a crazed parakeet. Whenever she did stand still, she kept tapping her foot on the ground.</p>
<p>“Isn’t she just adorable when she’s crazy on caffeine?” Rel said as we stood back and watched.</p>
<p>Nora took a book from the top of a stack, but she didn’t grip it tightly enough. It slipped through her fingers and hit the cobblestones on a corner, bounced, and fell open page-down in the dust of a hundred people’s feet. Nora winced and quickly knelt to pick it up.</p>
<p>“Hey! If you damaged that book, you’re buying it!” growled the stallkeeper, his bald head as red as a stop sign as he limped over, each footfall like an elephant stomping through the underbrush. He was on the outside what Miss Huckle was on the inside.</p>
<p>“S-sorry,” Nora stammered.</p>
<p>“Stuff your sorries in a sack! Give me that book! If there’s any damage, you’re paying for it!”</p>
<p>I went to back Nora up, and Rel followed me. The stallkeeper was running his fingers over the corner that had hit the ground. It was pretty dented. Even worse, the pages that had fallen face-down were covered in dust and smudged with dirt.</p>
<p>“This book is ruined,” said the stallkeeper. “You pay for it.”</p>
<p>“Good sir, please allow me,” said Rel.</p>
<p>“I don’t care who pays, as long as someone pays,” the stallkeeper said.</p>
<p>“How much, good sir, will it cost to repay the damage you’ve suffered?”</p>
<p>“Forty-nine ninety-five,” said the stallkeeper.</p>
<p>Rel took out his wallet, purple and red tie-dye, a bedazzled brass peace sign glittering with rhinestones across the front. He looked inside. “Good sir, may I confer with my sister a moment?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Give me your wallet first so I know you won’t run away.”</p>
<p>Rel handed it over and took me aside a little. Nora followed us, and we formed into a huddle out of the stallkeeper’s earshort. “Dear sister, might you find it in your heart to help a benighted traveler?” Rel said.</p>
<p>“Are you saying you don’t have enough money and you want to borrow some?” I asked. I took out my own wallet. “Geez, I don’t know if I have enough either…”</p>
<p>“Um. Please let me, help too,” said Nora. “After all it’s, my fault, to begin with.” Now, instead of never pausing as she talked, she was pausing in weird places.</p>
<p>“<em>Non</em>, <em>non</em>, I promised I would buy a book for you, and I will,” said Rel. “Aurelio Julio Octavio Mahal de los Reyes III keeps his word, do or die!”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t sound cool at all when you’re borrowing money from your little sister to keep your word,” I said.</p>
<p>Then Rel did something that I would never forgive him for. He said: “Amaranta Julia Eufemia Marikit de los Reyes III lends to her brother, do or die!”</p>
<p>I froze when I heard him start to say my full name. My heart was frozen too. I never would have thought he’d do something so mean! I was so shocked I couldn’t even jump on him and stuff my fists in his mouth like I usually did when he tried to say my full name.</p>
<p>“You idiot!” I cried, throwing my wallet aside and running at him with my fists raised. “How dare you say that—that name—here—in front of Nora—and everyone—how dare you—!” With each em-dash, I pounded on him, and he raised his arms, weakly trying to fend off my assault.</p>
<p>“Help, help, maniacal little sister attack!” Rel cried as I pounded on him, trying to make him pay for saying my full name in public. “Mad sister! Rabies! Murder! Fire! Help!”</p>
<p>“Um, please stop!” Nora exclaimed, pulling me back by the shoulders and letting Rel back out of range of my fists. With a great effort, I stopped myself. My teeth were bared, my jaw was clenched, and my heart was pounding, but I managed to stop myself from killing Rel.</p>
<p>“Here’s your wallet,” said Nora, taking my wrist and trying to put it in my fist. It bumped against my knuckles, and I realized my fingernails were almost cutting into my palms. With another great effort, I forced my muscles to relax, and my fingers uncurled.</p>
<p>“You heard it, didn’t you?” I asked as Nora placed my wallet in my now-open left hand.</p>
<p>“Heard what?” Nora asked. I didn’t close my fingers fast enough, and my wallet fell to the cobblestones again.</p>
<p>“That—that name. My full name.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t, really hear it,” said Nora. “It was so long that I—” She stopped. “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not you. It’s that—” I was about to start hitting Rel again, but stopped myself. “Anyway, let’s get you that book.” I knelt down and picked up my wallet, turned, and headed back towards the book stall, where the stallkeeper was glaring at me as if I were a scab he wanted to pick off and flick away.</p>
<p>“I’ll have you know, if you were my children, I’d beat you both,” he grumbled. “All three of you.” He narrowed his beady eyes at Nora, tapping her foot and snapping her fingers to some imaginary rhythm.</p>
<p>“Then it’s a good thing we’re not.” I opened my wallet. “How much does my idiot brother have? Thirty? Here’s another twenty. Keep the change.”</p>
<p>“Hmph. After that shameful display, I ought to raise the price.” The stallkeeper wrote up a receipt and handed it to Nora along with the book.</p>
<p>“Come on, let’s get out of here,” I said, putting my hand on Nora’s back and guiding her towards the path back to the elementary school. “Crotchety old geezer,” I muttered once we were out of the stallkeeper’s earshot.</p>
<p>We had crossed nearly the entire courtyard when Rel popped out of thin air beside Nora. Nora screamed and jumped what looked like five feet into the air, her back slamming into my front and knocking me off balance. I stumbled, regained my footing, and caught Nora under the arms just before she hit the pavement. The book flew out of her hand and took another nasty hit on the cobblestones. I pulled Nora to her feet, got the book, and set it in her hands. Before I did, I took a look at the cover. <em>The History of the Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire, Volume 4</em>, by Edward Gibbon. It didn’t seem much like Nora’s thing, but it was a step up from <em>Horror High</em>.</p>
<p>“Now, that’s not nice,” said Rel.</p>
<p>“What’s not nice is suddenly popping out of thin air and thinking we’re going to even want to see you after what just happened!” I said.</p>
<p>“Oh, sister. This is merely a pier on the great river flowing towards adolescence.”</p>
<p>“Whatever. I can’t deal with you anymore today. Please just go.”</p>
<p>“What of my parting hug?”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to hug you.”</p>
<p>“Then Nora shall. I make no secret, Nora, I tell it true, the one I wish to hug is you!”</p>
<p>Nora was behind me so fast, she might have also had the Gift of Instant Movement. I held up my hand, palm outward, to stop Rel from advancing.</p>
<p>“Um, thank, you, for the book,” said Nora over my shoulder. “And the coffee, too. I’m sorry for acting like this I think I need to go run in circles and scream for a few hours until it wears off.”</p>
<p>“Alas, so cute, Pan plays the flute!” Rel declaimed, both hands raised skyward. “And sister, what of you? Shall you grace me too” he added when he saw me stepping away.</p>
<p>“I wish we hadn’t met you, I try to keep my friends from knowing you exist, and go die,” I said.</p>
<p>“How cruel! But I know that someday, we siblings will reforge our broken bonds.”</p>
<p>“Good luck with that,” I said.</p>
<p>“Come see me if you need advice,” said Rel.</p>
<p>“I’ll come if I ever need to get rid of someone,” I said. “Next time I’ll introduce you to Cora.”</p>
<p>“Is she as angelic as Nora, this Cora?”</p>
<p>“No, she’s a shrill, loud, ungrateful blockhead. And after she meets you, I’ll never have to deal with her again.”</p>
<p>That was an empty threat, of course. I could never let Cora meet this fruitcake of a brother of mine. She would laugh at me forever after the first rhyming couplet. Jill and my other friends probably would too. Even though it was hard on poor Nora, I was glad it was her who had met Rel. She was too nice to laugh at me. She hadn’t even laughed at my full name.</p>
<p>We left Rel under the clock tower and headed up the path towards the elementary school. At first I felt so drained that I couldn’t think of a single word to say to Nora, who was still jittering, though it seemed like she didn’t want to run ahead anymore. By the time we reached the halfway point, marked by a big oak tree, I knew there was one thing I had to say, and it had to be said when Cora wasn’t around.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” I said. “I knew he was a weirdo, but I didn’t know he’d get all touchy-feely with you. I mean, he used to get like that with me, but I didn’t think he’d do it to someone outside the family.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” said Nora. “He just surprised me. And…I don’t like to be touched, especially by people I don’t know. Oh, you and Lily are different, though,” she added.</p>
<p>“It’s just so embarrassing,” I said. “He just always does whatever he wants, without thinking about how it’ll look to other people. He’s gotten worse and worse, too. Ever since he got into high school, he’s been so bad I couldn’t stand it. That was when he started talking in rhymes.”</p>
<p>“It could be worse,” said Nora. “My big sister loves soccer and archery and pranks. She kicked a soccer ball through the neighbor’s window as a prank one time. Another time, she shot arrows through their car tires. Then she hid, and when the neighbors came over to ask who shot arrows through their tires, I was the one who answered the door and got yelled at.”</p>
<p>“Were your parents home?” I asked.</p>
<p>“My dad was in his study getting ready for class. He puts on Bach so loud he can’t hear a thing, so it was almost an hour before he came down and saved me,” said Nora. “Next to my sister, your brother isn’t that bad. It seems like he cares about you, even if he’s a little weird.” She smiled. “But I’m still not going to hug him.”</p>
<p>We walked in silence for a while, watching the sun sink and turn the sky orange. When we were almost to the gates, I saw the book in Nora’s hand again, and I said, “That book looks pretty hard.”</p>
<p>“Oh, this? I was trying to get to the books underneath it,” said Nora with a rueful smile. “I was going to move it to another stack, but my hands were shaking so much, I…well, you know. But I think I’ll try reading it anyway. I don’t think it can be worse than <em>Horror High</em>, right?”</p>
<h1 id="angel-of-the-courtyard.-by-nora.">Angel of the Courtyard. By Nora.</h1>
<p>I finished <em>Horror High: Totes Terrified!</em> the day after Ranta and I went to the book fair and met her brother, Rel. I had made a fool of myself and ended up with <em>A History of the Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire, Volume 4</em>. I was going to try reading it someday, but for now I wanted something a little different.</p>
<p>Books can be kind of like food. Some books are strange and hard, but you read them just to say you’ve done it, like going to a fancy restaurant and eating weird designer food. Some are light and easy and sweet, but don’t leave you with much after you’re done, like cotton candy. <em>Horror High</em> was that kind of book. And some books are rich and filling and warm you up inside, like chicken soup on a rainy day. That was the kind of book I wanted to read right now, so after class ended, I went over to the library to look for one.</p>
<p>Miss Hanover had told me that if I couldn’t find anything in our library, she could take me to the high school’s library and show me around. The high school library was huge, she said; it had so many books that no one could possibly read them all, even if all they did was read and read for their entire life. Any other day, I would have said yes right away, but today I was a little scared of running into Rel again. Even with Miss Hanover to protect me, I didn’t want to see him again so soon.</p>
<p>So I crossed the courtyard to the elementary school library that day. I checked the poetry section, and found a book of poems by Emily Dickinson. My dad had told me about her, and I had read a few of her poems. The library had a big book with lots of poems I’d never read, so I checked it out and went back over to the clubroom.</p>
<p>When I got there, a note from Lily was pinned to the door. She had something to do today over at the middle school and wasn’t going to be back until late evening, so she’d left the clubroom locked. <em>Nora, Ranta, Cora, I’m sorry</em>, she had written at the end. <em>Everything will be back to normal tomorrow.</em></p>
<p>Since I couldn’t go into the clubroom, and I didn’t feel like going to my room or sitting in the lounge or the dining hall, I decided to find somewhere to sit on the grounds and read. I left the building the back way, the same way I’d gone yesterday with Ranta when we went to the high school, and came out into the old courtyard.</p>
<p>The old courtyard always felt a little sad to me, like a place for old, forgotten things. Its rusted fences and weathered pavement sat in constant dim, under the long shadow of the office building. Walking through it made me think somehow of run-down clocks, empty houses, velveteen rabbits.</p>
<p>I walked towards the back gates at the far end of the old courtyard, my book under my arm, but as I did, something on my left caught my eye, up between the old, bare planter boxes. It was something bright white, bright even in the dim, as if it were giving off its own light. I stopped and looked to where I’d seen it. There was nothing there. I figured it must have been a mirage or something, and kept on towards the back gates.</p>
<p>But there it was again, as I passed the next crossing: that bright white, flickering a few rows up between the planter boxes on my left. It may have been a mirage, but I wanted to go make sure.</p>
<p>I moved towards where I’d seen the flash of bright white, looking both ways at each crossing to see if there was anything that could have caught some stray beam of the sun and shone it at me as I passed.</p>
<p>Seeing nothing, I kept going, further away from the back gates. I passed what seemed like countless planter boxes, countless crossings, going deeper and deeper into the old courtyard. I don’t know why, but I felt sure that that bright white thing was somewhere here, that if I just went deeper, I would find it.</p>
<p>I finally came to a place where the rows of planter boxes ended. On the right, I could squeeze between the last planter box and a high wall made of light brown brick, overgrown with kudzu, and go towards the back gates. The left was blocked by the wall, but in front of me was an arch, so overgrown with kudzu that it looked like a hedge sculpture, and beyond that lay a narrow walkway, enclosed by the walls, that led further into the courtyard.</p>
<p>I passed under the archway and hooked left down the pathway. The pavement under my feet changed from big paving stones to marble, once white, now dim and grey, as I crossed the threshold, and I turned, and saw that ahead, to my right, was sunlight.</p>
<p>As I came closer to the light, I saw that just around the corner, the path opened onto another section of the old courtyard, this one flooded with sunlight. It lay outside the shadow of the office building, and its planter boxes weren’t empty and bare like the ones in the main section of the old courtyard. But they weren’t full of carefully tended daisies and tulips, like the ones in the new courtyard. Instead, they were overgrown with whatever had thrived in neglect and isolation, mostly the same kudzu that covered the arch and the brown brick walls outside.</p>
<p>As I came into the secret courtyard, my eye caught a flash of that bright white again, the same one I’d seen in the main section that had brought me in here. I jogged to the nearest planter box and turned the corner, and found a girl sitting on a bench.</p>
<p>She was about my age, hunched down, her face pointed at the ground, her dark blonde hair surrounding her head like a veil. The bright white had come from her cotton nightgown, an old-fashioned long-sleeved one with lace around the neckline, cuffs, and hem. It billowed out as she kicked her feet, falling slowly back into place only to be swept up again by her other leg.</p>
<p>I suddenly felt embarrassed. Here I was, in an old unknown corner of the school, with no good reason for being here. It would look like I’d followed this girl here, and I pretty much had, even though I hadn’t known I was doing it. I was about to turn around, run back the way I’d come, and go out the back gates like I’d meant to, without saying a word to the girl in the nightdress.</p>
<p>But she looked lonely. I couldn’t explain it , but she had the same feeling around her as the old courtyard itself: dim, lonely, forgotten, stopped clocks, empty houses, velveteen rabbits, dusty yellowed photographs. I remembered how lonely I’d felt my first two months here, before I met Lily and Ranta. I remembered how happy I’d been the day Lily talked to me and asked me to be her friend.</p>
<p>I approached the bench where the girl in the nightdress was kicking her feet. “Excuse me?” I said.</p>
<p>The girl looked up, her hair falling into place around her shoulders. It was beautiful hair, brushed and cut and cared for. Even though she hadn’t bothered to dress herself, she’d obviously taken a lot of trouble to make sure her hair looked nice before coming out here.</p>
<p>“Who are you? What are you doing here?” she asked me, her brown eyes looking me over.</p>
<p>I could feel my cheeks turning red. I was about to apologize and run away, but then I saw the look in her eyes. It wasn’t angry or suspicious; she was looking me over hungrily, like a starving person looks at a loaf of bread. “Um, my name is Nora,” I said. “I’m in sixth grade. I just…happened to find this place.”</p>
<p>“Do you like reading?” the girl asked, nodding at the book under my arm.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes. It’s my favorite thing. What about you?”</p>
<p>The girl shook her head. “No. I don’t like reading. I used to, but nowadays I can’t do anything except sit in my room and read, so I don’t like it anymore.” She nodded at the book again. “What book is that?”</p>
<p>“It’s a book of poems by Emily Dickinson. Do you like her?”</p>
<p>“Never heard of her. Do you want to sit down?” The girl patted the bench next to her.</p>
<p>I came to the bench and sat down beside her. “Would you read me your favorite poem from that book?” the girl asked.</p>
<p>“I haven’t read it yet, so I don’t know which is my favorite,” I said. “But I’ll find a good one for you.” I thumbed through the table of contents, looking for one that felt right. I found one I had read before, the one called “In a Library” that begins “A precious, mouldering pleasure ’t is/To meet an antique book”. I read it out loud to her.</p>
<p>“Wow, that’s pretty,” she said when I was done. “I mostly read Nancy Drew and Babysitter’s Club. It’s really different from that, but nice.”</p>
<p>“There are lots of them, do you want to hear another one?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>I don’t know how long we sat there reading that book. It felt like a short time, but the sky was turning orange by the time the girl said, “I have to go now, but can we meet again here tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“I’d like that,” I said.</p>
<p>As she was about to disappear down the path back to the old courtyard, I called out, “Wait! What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“Angelica,” she replied, and then she was gone.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The next day, I decided to skip the club and go to the secret courtyard to meet Angelica. I felt a little bad ditching Lily and Ranta, but they had each other, and maybe Cora, to talk to. On the other hand, I was pretty sure that Angelica had no one. From what she said and the way she was dressed, I was pretty sure she was sick. She’d probably gotten bored and lonely sitting in her room and had escaped, coming to the old courtyard, where we’d met. Since she hadn’t acted sick at all yesterday, she was probably almost over whatever she had, so I wasn’t very worried that she might be contagious.</p>
<p>I left the classroom and crossed the new courtyard. There was a covered walkway that led to the old courtyard, although hardly anyone used it. I walked under the arches, weaving around the patches of crabgrass intruding on the stone floor, and came out in the old courtyard just a few crossings from the secret courtyard where I’d met Angelica yesterday.</p>
<p>I passed again under the kudzu-covered arch and followed the brown brick walls out of the shadow and into the sunlight. Angelica was on the bench again, staring down at her feet with her hair veiling her face, her feet kicking against her bright white nightdress, but when she heard my footsteps, she looked up with a friendly smile. “I was afraid you wouldn’t come,” she said.</p>
<p>“Most days I have club right now,” I said, “but it seemed like you needed me more than my friends. And Cora.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad, but who’s Cora?” Angelica asked as I sat down beside her on the bench.</p>
<p>“Oh, no one.” I opened my bag and took out the Emily Dickinson book. “Do you want to read some more of this with me?”</p>
<p>After we’d been reading together for a while, Angelica put her hand on my arm and said, “I hear footsteps. Someone’s coming.”</p>
<p>“Nora?” came Cora’s voice over the planter boxes. “Are you in here?”</p>
<p>Part of me wanted to take Angelica and hide from her so I wouldn’t get yelled at, but before I could do that, she came around the corner. “Nora, you dingbat! What’re you doing?”</p>
<p>For her that was almost friendly. “I came to see my new friend, Angelica,” I said.</p>
<p>“Lily was really disappointed when you didn’t come. She tried to hide it, but I can tell. So I came to find you for her,” said Cora.</p>
<p>I turned to Angelica. “I did come here without telling Lily,” I said, “so I should go see her. Do you want to come and meet her? She’s the club president, and she’s really nice, I bet you’ll like her. Oh, this is Cora, by the way,” I added.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you,” Angelica said, standing up and coming to greet Cora, but Cora was looking down, her ears back and her tail twitching nervously, and she didn’t say a word to Angelica.</p>
<p>“Um, Cora?” I said.</p>
<p>“A-anyway, I found you, so get back there and don’t make Lily sad again,” Cora stammered. She turned and ran out of the secret courtyard, so fast it was like she was racing Ranta to get out.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, she’s usually not like that,” I said to Angelica. “Although, it might actually be a little better than how she usually is…”</p>
<p>“That’s okay,” said Angelica. “I think she was just being shy.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, I really should go see Lily, but do you want to come? She’s my best friend, and she’s really nice. I bet you’ll get along.”</p>
<p>“That’s all right, I should be getting back,” said Angelica. “Can we meet here again tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” I said.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Lily wasn’t mad at me, but she did say she felt bad when I wasn’t there. “I was worried you were mad at me about yesterday,” she said.</p>
<p>“Of course not,” I replied. “It’s just, I met someone yesterday. I think she’s sick, got bored, and sneaked out of the dormitory. She seemed lonely, so I spent some time with her yesterday, and she asked me to come back today.”</p>
<p>“What’s her name?” Ranta asked from the counter. She had taken over the tea today.</p>
<p>“Angelica,” I said. “We read some Emily Dickinson poems together.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think there was anyone with a name like that in our grade,” said Ranta. “How old was she? Did she look like a fifth grader?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” I said. “She could have been.”</p>
<p>“That girl is weird!” said Cora.</p>
<p>“Why, because she wasn’t taken in by your surly charms?” Ranta asked, bringing four cups of tea over to the table and serving Cora, Lily, and me.</p>
<p>“She’s just weird,” Cora insisted. “There’s something weird about her. Something creepy. She made all the hair on the back of my neck stand up.”</p>
<p>“Your hairy neck aside, can you be more clear about what made her weird?” Ranta asked.</p>
<p>“I can’t explain it, but she just gave me the willies,” said Cora.</p>
<p>“Have you noticed anything weird about this girl, Nora?” Lily asked.</p>
<p>I shook my head. “No, nothing.”</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The next day, I went to the clubroom for an hour, then left and spent the rest of the afternoon with Angelica in the secret courtyard, until the sky turned orange and Angelica told me she had to go. She asked me to come again the next day, and the day after, and so every day for the rest of the week, I spent an hour in the clubroom, then went down to spend time with Angelica.</p>
<p>“I started to hate reading,” Angelica confessed on the fourth day, after I’d read her a chapter of Charles Dickens’s <em>David Copperfield</em>. “I was sick, stuck in my room, and all the grown-ups brought me books about girls who went on big adventures, or girls who had fun every day with their friends. I liked them at first. But I was stuck in my room. I never got to do anything like the girls in those books. It made me jealous, and I started to hate them.”</p>
<p>“How long have you been sick?” I asked.</p>
<p>“A long time.”</p>
<p>“Can’t you find someone to heal you? The people at this school have all kinds of gifts. Someone might have a Gift that can get rid of your sickness. Maybe even Lily—she can grow plants with lots of different powers.”</p>
<p>Angelica, her hands on the bench beside her, her feet kicking out underneath her nightdress, didn’t answer. “Someone’s coming,” she said.</p>
<p>A moment later, Cora came around the corner, Lily trailing behind her. “This is the place,” said Cora.</p>
<p>“Hi Lily,” I said. “Angelica, this is my friend Lily.”</p>
<p>Now Angelica was looking down at her feet, and at the hem of her nightdress as it floated down after a kick of her foot. “Hello,” she mumbled.</p>
<p>Lily didn’t say anything. “Um, I’m not sure if she heard you,” I said. “Lily, can you come over here?”</p>
<p>“Sure.” Lily came to my side, and I stood up next to Angelica and gave Lily my seat on the bench.</p>
<p>“I should go,” Angelica said abruptly. She got up and brushed past me, past Cora, who jumped aside like she’d been poked with a needle, and hurried around the corner out of sight.</p>
<p>I bit my lip, looking to Lily to see how she was taking this. But Lily hadn’t reacted at all. She was still looking at the spot where Angelica had been sitting a second ago, as if expecting Angelica to speak.</p>
<p>“See?” said Cora. “I’m telling you, that girl’s weird! There’s something off about her!”</p>
<p>“She’s just lonely, and she’s been sick a long time, so she’s not used to meeting new people,” I said.</p>
<p>Lily shook her head. “No. Cora’s right, there’s something weird about her. Something very weird.”</p>
<p>“See?” said Cora.</p>
<p>“Actually, no,” said Lily, even though Cora had been talking to me. “That’s what’s so weird. I couldn’t see her.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? She was right there,” said Cora, pointing at the spot next to Lily on the bench.</p>
<p>“Yeah, she was,” I said. “She was sitting right next to you. She said hello, but it was so quiet you couldn’t hear, so I asked you to come closer.”</p>
<p>“Can you both describe her to me?” Lily asked.</p>
<p>“A girl with blonde hair, in a nightgown and slip-on boots,” said Cora, and I nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>“I didn’t see anyone like that,” said Lily. “When we came around the corner, I only saw Nora sitting alone on the bench.”</p>
<p>Cora stomped her foot. “I knew it! That girl is a ghost!”</p>
<p>“That’s silly. I don’t believe in ghosts,” I said firmly.</p>
<p>“Whether you believe or not, that’s what she is,” Cora insisted. “My grandpa always said he could see them. He said cats know when they’re around. I’ve had a bad feeling about that girl ever since I first saw her.”</p>
<p>I looked to Lily, hoping for some backup. Lily looked very serious as she stood up. “I don’t know if Angelica is a ghost,” she said. “I couldn’t see her, but that might be part of her Gift. Why don’t you try asking her, Nora?”</p>
<p>“No way, I wouldn’t go near her,” said Cora. “If she’s a gh-ghost…She might be trying to drag you off to die with her.”</p>
<p>“Angelica wouldn’t hurt me!” I said, even though I had no proof, just a feeling. “She’s my friend.”</p>
<p>“If she’s your friend,” said Lily, “ask her what’s going on. She’ll tell you.”</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I had never been so mad at Cora. I didn’t care if Angelica was a ghost, a witch, had the Gift of Invisibility, or what. She was my friend, and that was it. But Cora had just had to get Lily worried by mewling about how weird Angelica was. And if Lily was worried about me, I had to do something to make her feel better. After all, she was my first and best friend. If not for her, I don’t think I ever would have found the courage to talk to Angelica at all.</p>
<p>The next day was Saturday. The skies were cloudy when I woke up, although I didn’t smell the water in the air that usually meant rain. The last few weeks, I’d been spending my Saturdays helping Cora and Ranta with their homework in the clubroom, but today I didn’t want to see Cora at all. I even skipped breakfast so I wouldn’t run into her.</p>
<p>I went straight over to the old courtyard. It was even darker than usual under the grey skies, but when I emerged into the secret courtyard, it was full of sunlight as always. I turned the corner, and there was Angelica sitting on the bench as usual.</p>
<p>She didn’t look up as I came closer. I sat down next to her. “I didn’t think you would come,” said Angelica.</p>
<p>“I had to come,” I said. “You’re my friend.”</p>
<p>“Lily couldn’t see me, right?” Angelica’s eyes stayed the hem of her nightdress, her feet kicking.</p>
<p>“Cora said you were a ghost,” I said.</p>
<p>“Did you believe her?”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe in ghosts. And I don’t care, anyways. You’re my friend. But Lily is my friend too, and she’s worried,” I said. “I don’t want to make her worry. But all we have to do is explain to her—maybe you could tell me, and later we could tell Cora together, and Cora and I can tell Lily—and it’ll be all right.”</p>
<p>Angelica sighed, and all of a sudden the courtyard went dark, the clouds blotting out the sun as they had in the new courtyard. But her nightgown still shined bright white, as if it were glowing, the same shine that I’d followed through the old courtyard a week ago when I first met Angelica. “I don’t really know how to explain it,” she said. “I don’t know what you’d call me. Not a ghost. A leftover memory, maybe, like a picture of someone who was gone a long time ago. My Gift let me stay somehow, even when I should have disappeared.</p>
<p>“You see, I was always sick. I came to school on and off whenever I could—my parents even moved into town so I could come to St. Galgani’s. But since I was gone so much, I never had any real friends. Sometimes I’d have friends for a while, but I always ended up having to go the hospital again, and when I came back, they’d have forgotten me.</p>
<p>“I had to spend almost my whole fifth grade year in the hospital. I came back to repeat fifth grade, but the doctors told me it would be the last time I ever went to school. I tried to make friends, but no one remembered me, and…” Angelica ran her fingers through her long, blonde hair. “My mother used to help me take care of my hair, but it all fell out in the end, and I looked so weird, I just couldn’t make any friends like that…I even died alone, my parents didn’t make it in time. I was at the infirmary and no one was there. I just couldn’t stand it, that I was here for four years and not a single person would remember me.”</p>
<p>I could see tears starting to run down her cheeks. I took Angelica’s hand. “It doesn’t matter, it’s okay, I’m your friend now, none of it matters,” I said.</p>
<p>Angelica grasped my hand with both of hers and leaned towards me, and I could feel her warm, wet tears falling on my wrists. “It’s okay, I’ll remember you,” I said. “Just try to imagine it. Think about how it would’ve been. We would’ve eaten lunch together at the dining hall. We would’ve read together, not just here, but all over the place. You could’ve joined my club, and met Lily and Ranta. And when you died…all of us would have been there. And when you were gone, we would have all cried. I would’ve cried until I was dried out like a onion skin.”</p>
<p>Angelica put her arms around me, and buried her face in my shoulder. We stayed like that for a long time. When I finally thought to look at the sky, it was dark, and the stars were out. It was a full moon, and the clouds had cleared.</p>
<p>“I have to go now,” said Angelica. She stood up, her arms still around me, as if she were reluctant to let go. The white light of the moon lit up her hair and face, and shined through her nightgown, making it like a sheer veil between earth and the stars.</p>
<p>“I’ll remember you,” I promised. “I won’t forget you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Angelica. “That was all I wanted.” She leaned down and kissed me on the forehead, and then she trotted off in her boots, her nightdress trailing behind her, and disappeared around the corner.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Lily met me at the end of the covered walkway into the new courtyard. “I was worried about you,” she said. “Were you able to sort things out with Angelica?”</p>
<p>I nodded. “‘That is solemn we have ended,—’” I recited, and stopped. I don’t know if Lily was confused, but she didn’t ask.</p>
<p>We walked back to the dorm together. It was eight at night, long past curfew for elementary school students, but Lily apologized to Mrs. Lovett and said we’d been on a club activity and she’d lost track of time. Mrs. Lovett, as understanding as always, gave me four hours of bathroom-cleaning duty as punishment.</p>
<p>After that, I started to go to the secret courtyard on weekends to read. The first time, I went alone, but Lily came the next time and said she wanted to try and put something nice in the overgrown planter boxes. Ranta came the next time, and we eventually convinced Cora that there were no ghosts.</p>
<p>Angelica never appeared again. But I thought of her every time I went. I like to think she was there with us somehow, enjoying a book with me and Ranta, admiring the white and gold tulips that Lily coaxed out of the flower beds, or trying to ignore Cora’s complaints.</p>
