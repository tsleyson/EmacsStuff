## The Camping Trip, Part 2
I don't camp, so the scene at the end probably bears no resemblance to actual camping. Also, the scene in the middle bears no resemblance to actual camping. Giant spiders that talk with the voices of old ladies are few and far between nowadays.

## Cora's Weekend
It's always fun to imagine how things would go. It pretty much never happens like you imagined, though. That's why you shouldn't listen to those guys who talk about politics on the news. It pretty much never goes like they imagined it would, either.

## Puzzles aren't that hard
They really are that hard.

## The Hostage Crisis
I don't want to scare you. But there are some things you need to hear, as part of growing up. So here goes: Mrs. Smith's folk sing-along is based on true events. It really happened. As in the story, the real Mrs. Smith retired, and we were freed from the folk sing-alongs.

That said, I think I was the only person who preferred being in class to the folk sing-along. In class, we had chairs.

## The Cat Girl's Mafia
The girls' mobster names:
  - Nora: Green-Eyes Rosen
  - Cora: Paws Fiorentino (or Four-Eyes-Four-Ears Fiorentino)
  - Lily: Blondie
  - Ranta: Ranta the Shoes
  - Miss Hanover: Tricky Anne

## Alone with Lily...
Keep this story in mind. It sets up the foundation for some pretty big events coming up. You will meet the Wooden Girls in person, too, probably in the next book.

## My Brother Embarrasses Me
The opening scene, where Ranta comes to the clubroom to invite Nora to the book fair, is slightly different from the way Cora sees that same scene in "Alone with Lily..." So who's right? Who do you trust moreâ€”Ranta, or Cora?

## Angel of the Courtyard
Why did Nora read *Horror High*? We never actually found out.
