*  Thoughts on Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai
** Thoughts on Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai (The World Only God Knows) from Wednesday 31st August, 2011, just after finishing with the second season and re-watching Episode 1 of the first season:

Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai was actually one of the first shows I ever watched on Crunchyroll, possibly the first (my first ever streaming show was Ore Imo, on Anime News Network). But I watched the first scene of the first episode, where Keima gets beaten up by his teacher Nikaido for playing games in class, and then ran into technical difficulties and decided the show probably wasn't worth the trouble anyway. I often get into a mental tug-of-war with myself over otaku service shows; the side that says they're trash that I shouldn't bother with usually keeps me away from them for a little while, then loses its grip, and I end up watching and enjoying them. It happened with Lucky Star early on, and it also happened with Kami Nomi.

But I was wrong about the show in another way, too: it isn't an otaku service show. It's actually more like FLCL, in that it makes references to otaku culture in between good writing and clever humor that encompasses a lot more than just video games and anime. 

Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai is about the above-mentioned Keima Katsuragi, a high school student who's so obsessed with video games (especially renai and bishoujo games, which he calls "galge") that he's forsaken reality. He's so good at bishoujo games that he can beat games he's never played before in a single go. This has earned him the name "Otoshigami" or "God of Conquest" on the Internet. People come to his website asking for help with games, and Keima obliges them. One day he gets an e-mail asking for his help as the "God of Conquest", which he takes as a challenge and answers, trapping him in a contract with a perky, ditzy demon named Elsie. Elsie has come up from Hell to capture Loose Souls, fragments of soul that live in the emptiness inside people's hearts. The only way to capture them is to dislodge them by filling up the emptiness in the host's heart. The demons have human "buddies" who do this by making the host fall in love with them, dislodging the soul and letting the demon capture it. Keima is horrified by the idea of "conquering" a real girl, but once the contract with Elsie is made, collars appear on both of their necks that will explode if the contract isn't fulfilled, decapitating them, so Keima resigns himself to his fate. He begins by conquering one of his classmates, Ayumi Takahara, a member of the track team, and continues with Mio Aoyama, a rich tsundere girl; Kanon Nakagawa, a famous idol star; and Shiori Shiomiya, the shy library girl. In the second series he goes on to capture karate master Kusunoki Kasuga, student teacher Jun Nagase, and, grudgingly, the overwhelmingly normal Chihiro Kousaka, who Keima considers only fit to be a background character. The second series also introduces Elsie's former classmate Haqua, who's sort of like the fourth girl in the series, although Elsie does most of the work to get the loose soul out of her.

Somehow, even with all these characters, the show manages to give them all good storylines and unique traits that keep them from devolving into stereotype. My favorites among the girls were Shiori and Nagase. Shiori was probably the closest to her character type's usual form, but the show did a good job of letting us get inside her head and feel what she felt. I liked the determination she showed in the last part of her story, and as a failed novelist, I always like it when characters are writing a book. In fact, Shiori's story reminded me in some ways of the Miyazaki film Whisper of the Heart.

I liked Nagase and her story for the opposite reasons. Where Shiori's story was a good old-fashioned story about a shy library girl, Nagase's story was about the actual effectiveness of the sort of idealistic, "inspirational" teacher that frequently appears in fiction. Nagase is a student teacher visiting her alma mater for two weeks of training while she's in education school, and has an odd, one-dimensional view of teaching. She thinks of teaching as being about creating a perfect classroom and school by making sure everyone is engaged and included. She's also a huge fan of professional wrestling, which she says she likes because it's about the battle of two wills to claim ideal strength. When she actually comes to the school, though, she finds that things aren't so simple; teachers mistreat students, who simply tolerate it, and problem children are allowed to separate themselves from the class because the teachers have given up on trying to include them. Nagase first notices this with Keima, who as usual is sitting in class playing bishoujo games and ignoring the lecture. Throughout her story, she is forced to deal with the way her ideals conflict with the real world. I've seen similar stories before, but I found this one unique because in the end, Nagase doesn't give up her ideals, or even lighten up on them; in order to make her fall in love with him, Keima actually encourages her to stick with them. The students in the class apologize to Nagase not because she promises to go easy on them, but because of pity, stoked by Keima as part of his plan to reach an ending.

I also really liked Elsie; she was always adorable and fun, serving as Keima's bumbling sidekick who he explains all his grand plans to. Even though Keima is never very nice to her, she still serves him faithfully, and thanks to him, she's at the front of the pack in Loose Soul captures. Elsie was probably the most moe character in the show.

But the real centerpiece of the cast is Keima himself, and the show wouldn't work otherwise. I've seen other reviews describe him as a comedic refactoring of Death Note's Light Yagami and Code Geass's Lelouch, and I think the author of the original manga did intend this. The anime uses a lot of the same religious imagery that came about in Death Note whenever Light started rambling about his plans to become a god, but jokingly applies it to bishoujo games and gaming skill. Like Light, Keima is actually rather handsome, and he's a master schemer, analyzing the girls' psyches (always in terms of bishoujo game cliches) and figuring out exactly what to say to win their love. He never gets to be too cool, though; most of the girls beat him up or make him suffer at some point in their stories, from Mio making him drag her up a hill in a rickshaw to Kanon zapping him with a cat-shaped stun gun. He will do anything to play games; during Nagase's story the other teachers talk about their attempts to make him stop, and the PE teacher mentions that Keima plays games while swimming. When the PE teacher tried to take away his PFP (Play Field Personal), Keima whipped out more and more of them until the teacher gave up. He is shown playing two and three PFPs at once, and also has the ability to go into "God of Conquest Mode", where he can play six games at once, moving his hands across the controllers with such speed that they blur into six, making him look like a Hindu deity, and reading all six stories at once on six separate screens. 

Keima's love of games has never lessened, but the show is ambiguous about whether he is warming up to real girls or is just such a great schemer that he rigs certain scenes to make it look that way. For instance, during Chihiro's story, Chihiro asks him how can talk about her love life when he's never even kissed a girl, and Keima flashes back to his five previous conquests and, blushing, says "It wasn't such a big deal." This evokes a reaction from Chihiro, so it's hard to say whether thinking about that made him feel something and give a genuine reaction, which just happened to do what he wanted to Chihiro, or whether he knowingly reacted that way just to manipulate Chihiro. 

The show does have some storytelling flaws; whenever it gets too deep into drama, it tends to drag. This happened most noticeably during Kanon's story. The writers seemed to realize this, though; the only time I felt fatigue threaten after that was in the middle of Nagase's story, and this was quickly solved when things got moving again. With the great animation, attractive art, fun comedy, and well-written stories, I hope the creators consider making a third season, and maybe we can get the manga over here. 

** A Short Additional Comment from Friday, December 2nd, 2011:

The drama in the Kanon story arc did start to drag a little, but I had forgotten how adorable some of the things leading up to it were. Kanon for some reason decides that since Keima is the only person she knows at school, she wants to be friends with him, and starts e-mailing him all the time wanting to talk about her problems. Then one day she e-mails him and when he asks what the problem is, she says there was no problem and she just wanted to see him, leaving Keima a little surprised.

The most adorable scene was just before a concert, when Kanon calls Keima to tell him how nervous she is about the concert. Keima is only half-listening, because as usual he's plugged into his PFP (Play Field Personal). Kanon complains, but then notices he's listening to her music and says if he likes her music, she wants him to compliment her. This takes the form of Keima grudgingly patting her on the head like a dog, which was too cute.

(I'm sure Keima did that on purpose; he professed to have no interest in her music, and he's always setting things up to make it look like he's slowly coming around to like a girl.)

During Chihiro's story arc, Keima knocks Chihiro into the guy she's after and makes her spill hot tea on him, telling her that creating a bad impression is a good way to make someone conscious of her. On reviewing the series, I noticed that Keima always (almost pathologically) goes out of his way to make a terrible first impression (other than with Ayumi, when he made a bad impression unintentionally due to not have any experience): he makes a creepy love confession to Mio, pretends not to know who Kanon is, and angers Shiori by saying books are outdated and should be thrown away. (I can't remember what he did with Kusunoki; he definitely made a bad impression on Chihiro, though it wasn't part of any strategy; and he resisted Nagase's efforts to become his friend.)

** Some Addenda, Thursday, February 23rd, 2012:

I'm currently rewatching the series, having purchased the DVD set of the first season. The early episodes left me with pretty similar impressions, but those from the Kanon story onward felt a little different this time.

For one thing, I didn't feel that same sense of fatigue during the thick of the Kanon story that I did last time. The second Kanon episode was, as I mentioned above, intensely adorable; it and the Kanon finale made me wish Keima and Kanon would just hook up. I loved the scene where Keima finds Kanon in the snow after she turns invisible before her big concert and, just before she tries to kiss him, says continuing to seek validation from others is a cop out and she needs to validate herself. The show was vague about exactly what needs to happen for a Loose Soul to be dislodged from a girl's heart, so was Keima just ensuring that the Loose Soul would leave Kanon when she kissed him, or was he actually trying to help her, to make sure that she would come out of the experience changed for the better? As usual, we can't tell from this whether Keima is totally bent on his own plans (to finish quickly and play more games) at any cost or whether he actually cares in some way about the girls he "conquers". This makes him actually deeper than his serious counterparts Light (who definitely didn't care about anything but his plans) and Lelouch (who, at least as of Episode 5, cares about his sister Nunnally and not much else). After this, Kanon goes and gives her big concert, and as Keima and Elsie leave, Elsie asks if Keima has changed his mind about real idols. Keima says "N-Not yet..." in a way that suggests he does like Kanon, even if he has the same opinions about real idols in general.

In between story arcs, Kami Nomi throws in lighter comic episodes (most involving Haqua in the second series), and Episode 8 is one of those. It's a lot of fun, and the most adorable episode yet for the most adorable character in the show, Elsie. (As adorable as Kanon and Shiori are; even Ayumi and Mio are forces to be reckoned with, but Elsie trumps them all.) The episode recounts the same events from multiple perspectives. Elsie tries to make lunch for Keima, but it's some horrible underworld creature made of eyes and tentacles. Keima gets mad and yells at her, saying she's like one of those buggy games (like Crayon, the game starring Sora Asuka from Episode 4, that gets trapped in a loop and sometimes randomly replaces Sora with an old man) and starts calling her "bugguma" ("bug" and "akuma"). Since it's Elsie, it just comes off as cute, whereas Keima's classmates' nickname for him, "Otamega", a combination of "otaku" and "megane", doesn't feel like it has nearly the insulting air it should. Elsie complains to Chihiro, who can't figure out why Elsie cares (actually, I can't quite figure out why she cares either, except that she seems to have some hero worship thing about Keima. I guess it is thanks to him that she's leading the Loose Souls team in captures). Chihiro suggests that Elsie make Keima a cake, which Elsie does, accidentally unleashing a mandragon from one of her many hell creature eggs that she intends to use in the cake. (During the cooking scene, Elsie appears to be a competent cook, but she uses underworld ingredients and apparently doesn't understand how to operate an oven, instead sticking the cake in the microwave and suspending the microwave over a campfire to cook it.) 

The mandragon and several other creatures that hatch destroy the home economics room and the dragon flies off with Elsie's cake stuck to its nose. We then switch to Keima's perspective and see how his English teacher (who has awful pronunciation, by the way) hates him because he plays games in class and still gets 100 on his exams. The teacher calls Keima's mother and tells her he's going to come by to talk about Keima that evening. We switch to Mari's (Keima's mother) perspective and see her get in the bath to wash off the dirt from working on her motorcycle so she can be presentable when the teacher arrives. While she's in the bath, the dragon knocks at the window and drops the cake. Mari thinks someone's broken in and goes down into the cafe in a towel, grabs a vase, and accidentally whacks Keima over the head as he kneels behind the counter eating the cake. We saw him earlier, getting home, finding the cake on the bush with a note from Elsie, and then rushing inside to do a time-dependent event in his game. At this point we discover that he actually ate the cake. 

The dragon goes up to the roof and is confronted by the tentacled creature that Elsie packed for lunch earlier, which gulps down the dragon in a scene that reminded me irresistibly of FLCL, then attacks Keima's English teacher as he comes up to the gate. The story's final scene occurs after Mari receives the news that the teacher isn't coming (which was shown earlier in the episode); Keima and Elsie are sitting on the couch, Keima's head bandaged, and he mentions that he hates sweet food, and the disappointed Elsie gives up her plan to prove her worth by making a cake.

I don't know what happens in the manga, but I like how there's never any hint of romance between Keima and Elsie in the anime. They're pretending to be brother and sister, and Elsie's hero worship of Keima looks appropriately sisterly and is adorable. Elsie's bungles are too cute, especially when she totally misapprehends what's wrong with a situation, as in Episode 2 when she washes Keima's PFP with water and when he says "You washed it with water?!" says "I used soap too!", or in Episode 8 when the dragon chases her (stirring cake batter) across the school grounds and she says after escaping, "That dragon getting loose was bad. It could have eaten the cake!"

Episodes 9, 10, and 11 are the Shiori story. So far I've watched Episodes 9 and 10, and although there was a little too much time devoted to Shiori's lyrical expounding of why she loves books, I've again really enjoyed it so far. At the beginning of Episode 9 we get to have double power constructive adorableness when Elsie goes to the library to follow Keima's order to read up on the human world and ends up getting obsessed with fire trucks for some reason. She goes to ask the librarian for more books about fire trucks and finds Shiori reading, oblivious to the world. Shiori looks up and jumps, then is unable to speak. Whenever she freezes and can't speak, thought balloons with dots in them appear around her head, multiplying until she finally finds some words. She tells Elsie to come back after school. Elsie's Loose Soul detector goes off, so she drags Keima to see Shiori, who has brought an entire flatbed cart of books about fire trucks for Elsie. 

Probably one of the funniest moments in the entire first series is when Keima explains to Elsie that librarian girls are always thinking to themselves, and to conquer one, you have to listen to the voice of her heart. Elsie asks how that's done and Keima brings up a game screen and points to it, at the bottom of the screen in parentheses. Elsie says that only works in games, and Keima casually declares the conquest impossible.

But Keima does find a way to hear the voice of Shiori's heart: by pissing her off. First he says that books take up too much room and should be digitized and destroyed. This prompts Shiori to finally say a single word: "Bakaaa~aa~aa!", which she says with great effort, her voice cracking on the ~s. The next day, Keima finds a history of games in the library and corrects the release timeline by writing in the book, again prompting Shiori's rage. This time she says "Ahoo~oo~oo!" Keima insists that he's making good progress by hearing the whisper of her heart, despite Elsie's skepticism. Keima gets Shiori's wires crossed with another writing-in-a-book incident so that her inner and outer voices switch and she momentarily says what she really thinks out loud. Finally, he triggers a positive interaction by sitting in the library playing his PFP and mentioning to Shiori when she appears that he likes the library because it's quiet and all the noise of the real world is outside. Shiori sits down across from him and sets down a book she was holding; for a moment, they sit across from one another, Keima with his PFP at his elbow, Shiori with her book, and their similarity is expressed symbolically. Shiori then stutters "Take your time" and runs off. At the end of Episode 10, Keima happens to see Shiori tear up a piece of paper and run off. He has Elsie reconstruct what turns out to be a list of books which are to be disposed of to make room for a new media center for the library, with DVDs and music. Keima puts this evidence together with what he heard from Shiori about the media center when her wires were crossed and what he guesses about her based on galgame stereotypes and declares that he can see the ending. 

Shiori was even cuter than I remembered when I wrote my original thoughts. I loved seeing her lost for words with pink thought bubbles popping up all around, and it was too cute when she finally lost it and yelled "Bakaaa~aa~aa!" with that adorable crack in her voice, then later thought to herself "The power of unbridled anger is frightening". I empathize with the problem of standing around saying nothing, looking like a weirdo while obsessively considering what the best response is. I'm looking forward to once again seeing the end of her story and the final episode, when we see Keima's "God of Conquest Mode". I hope Sentai Filmworks releases the second series as well.

I should mention that the DVD set also includes a dub, which I wasn't terribly impressed with. To be frank, it was a throwback to the bad dubs of the early 2000s. Partially it's because Kami Nomi had a lot more moe than I remembered, and moe tends to dub terribly. I was totally unimpressed with Keima's dub voice. A character like Keima needs a special kind of voice, and the guy they got wasn't it; he was missing both the outraged yell of comedic Keima and the low determination of serious Keima. Most of the lines were delivered with the emotion usually displayed by a fencepost, and weirdly timed to fit around awkward writing designed to ruthlessly fit the lip flap. The only decent bit of casting was Hilary Haag as both Mio and Shiori; Hilary Haag is one of the few English voice actors with a voice cute enough to play moe characters. I think it's because her voice really sounds like that, so she can concentrate on acting and doesn't have to focus on doing weird things with her voice to try and make it sound right. I watched the show in Japanese, so I saw the cast list for the dub first in the credits, then backtracked and listened to them. I considered Shiori just about impossible to dub, but when I saw that Hilary Haag had been cast again, I decided to go back and listen, and she did pretty well. Most of the adorableness of Kana Hanazawa's Japanese performance made it through into English, and all of Shiori's lyrical lines about the wonders of books came out sounding sincere and natural. Hilary Haag was also good as the bratty Mio, but I think Shiori was the more difficult performance and she pulled it off. Speaking of Kana Hanazawa, she softens up her performance from Ore Imo, finding a nice medium between the brashness of Kuroneko and the whisper of Angel Beats's Kanade. Nao Toyama has a very nice rhythm to her role as Kanon, and Yuuki Aoi animates Mio's sneer with the right mixture of cuteness and contempt. Ayana Taketatsu as Ayumi is cute as always, angling towards the ditzy side, with a performance less strident than Kirino and louder than Azu-nyan. As I mentioned above, the Japanese version's Hiro Shimono set the bar pretty high for Keima, switching easily between childish screaming, grave pronouncement, and impassioned oratory. My favorite performance of the Japanese version is Kanae Ito as Elsie; she gives the perfect amount of cuteness to every Elsie scene, from the bashfulness Elsie feels when Mari points out that she's wearing the same ribbon as Kanon, to the wistful story Elsie tells Keima about her older sister, to the sobbing Elsie does when Mari scolds her for going out late at night to the TV station to see Kanon.

Kami Nomi feels even more fun the second and a halfth time around (I watched up through Episode 6 on fansubs after watching the whole series on Crunchyroll). I look forward to also seeing the second series again.

** Wrap-Up on Friday, February 24th, 2012:

I found Shiori's ending too abrupt and I didn't like that she and Keima never really have a decent conversation. I hope the manga has some sort of "check in" scene like the one with Ayumi during Chihiro's story arc; even if I never get to read it, I'm just glad to know it exists and that Shiori's story doesn't end there. I would have liked to see at least one nice, thick conversation between Keima and Shiori, possibly where they have a more proper discussion about their similarities and differences as fellow deniers of reality than was given in the last part of Shiori's story.

I loved the final episode once again, where Keima enters "God of Conquest Mode", playing and comprehending six games at once, and the different routes of the galgame explode in his head. At one point he synchronizes the games so that all six are on a kiss scene at the same time.

The Next Episode preview for Episode 12 featured art of Keima and Elsie, with Keima holding up his PFP and Yokkyun (from the game One Leaf, that Keima becomes obsessed with in Episode 12 of the second series) on the screen. This became quite amusing when I discovered the art was by Key's Itaru Hinoue, whose designs Yokkyun was created as a parody of. Actually, the art didn't look much like her work at all, but she's changed quite a bit since Kanon, as we see by looking at the Clannad designs.

** A Note, Sunday, February 26th, 2011:

Shiori's stats during the Black Jack parody indicate that she's 162 cm tall and weighs 41 kg. Since I totally don't have exams to study for, I converted those into imperial units. Shiori stands an impressive 5'3" and weighs in at 103 lbs. That's actually a little more than I was expecting. Given the difference in height between Shiori and Keima, Keima must be about 5'6". 

** Another Note, Wednesday, August 29th, 2012:

Turns out I'm an idiot. Shiori is 153 cm tall, which is more like 5' zip. I must have written the above note based on memory, without actually looking at the number. That's more like the height I was expecting; that means Keima is probably more like 5' 3" or 5' 4". I also got the weight conversion wrong—it's more like 90 lbs.

I'm watching Kami Nomi again right now, because I really felt like it. I just watched Episode 10, the second episode of the Shiori arc, again. I think the Kanon arc is the highlight of the first series, but I love Shiori herself. Shiori probably makes the best match for Keima of any girl in the series, but his relationship with Kanon was ridiculously sweet. 

Now that I've actually watched Code Geass, whose Lelouch Keima is largely a parody of, I can appreciate a lot of the humor in Keima's character even more. But weirdly, Keima is actually cooler than Lelouch. He gets beat up and looks totally uncool a lot, but he always does it while accomplishing some master plan, unlike Lelouch, who looked like a bumbling fool on too many occasions (cat steals his mask, totally misreads Suzaku's personality, accidentally orders Euphemia to kill all Japanese). 

Given Keima's similarity to Lelouch, the dub might have worked (better, anyway) if they'd gotten Johnny Yong Bosch, who did Lelouch's dub voice, to play him. I never watched much of the dub, but Johnny Yong Bosch is generally a decent actor and seemed pretty good as Lelouch. Then they should just have had Hilary Haag play Elsie, Ayumi, and Kanon too.

** Thoughts on a second viewing of Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai II (Episodes 1, 2, and 3), begun Monday, September 10th, 2012:

I bought the second series of Kami Nomi. I was going to buy it anyway, but I had planned to get the next part of the second series of K-On first; since I randomly decided to watch the first Kami Nomi again, though, it seemed fitting that I get this first.

The second series begins with a short recap shown in the form of an eight-bit RPG, with the eight-bit midi of "God Only Knows" as background music, and we get to see what the girls from the first series would look like as eight-bit RPG battle art. After the new opening, "A Whole New World God Only Knows", it launches straight into the first story, that of Kusunoki Kasuga. I remember liking Kusunoki's story pretty well; in fact, I had put off watching this show (during that huge run of insane Crunchyroll viewing at levels above 9000 that I did last year when I was visiting my mother, who has broadband, when I watched nineteen episodes of Hanasaku Iroha and eleven of Kami Nomi II, among other shows), because I hadn't remembered liking the first series enough to want to watch a sequel. Once I watched Kusunoki's story, though I was into it again. 

This time, I didn't need any convincing, but Kusunoki's story didn't blow me away. I still liked it and I liked the character a lot, but it felt too short. Actually, it wasn't that the story wasn't fully explored, but it was rather bare-bones; we get a couple montages of Keima training under Kusunoki, and then a date scene, which is also largely montage, finishing with one of the weaker endings of the Kami Nomi girls (Keima didn't even have his "House" moment where he mumbles everything he knows about the girl and then declares "Endingu ga mieta zo"). It almost felt like they were rushing along to get to the appearance of Haqua.

We'll talk about Haqua later, but first I'd like to mention that there were some scenes I really liked in Kusunoki's story. There was the very first scene, when Keima is getting beaten up by some delinquents because they run into him and demand an apology, which prompts him to tell Elsie "Don't worry, these guys are background characters. They might as well be parsley." Kusunoki appears and saves him, then tells him he's weak. The first sign of her true personality is when Elsie appears and is brought to the edge of tears by Keima's yelling. Elsie is adorable, and everyone knows it; Kusunoki can't stop staring at her and turns red because of her adorableness. Kusunoki also seems to find Keima cute, as she gets like this a few times during the training sequences. Her favorite cute thing is the cat that hops around the school wearing a big pink ribbon for some reason; her secret comes out because Keima and Elsie find her in the locker room cuddling the cat after a training session. That was another really cute scene.

The Loose Soul inside Kusunoki causes her suppressed feminine side to appear as a spectral doppelganger whenever she happens to feel some "weak" emotion. The final scene is a date with Keima that Elsie suggests because Kusunoki wants to do the weakest thing possible to make her feminine side appear so she can defeat it in combat and drive all weakness out of her. Keima brings her to a game store, and when she gets mad, lets her choose the next destination, an athletic supply store. They go to an arcade and play "Whack a lobster", which Keima chooses because it combines games and martial arts. Shortly after meeting, Keima declared that he was also master of a world and summoned up his gal game girls, and Kusunoki recognized him as someone else as driven and obsessed as her. Kusunoki gets a good score, but Keima effortlessly beats her score and she spends more time than he wants trying to best him.

In the final scene, Kusunoki fights her feminine side, but since they are equally skilled martial artists, neither can win. Her feminine side wants to give up martial arts and do girly things. Keima suggests that she can be strong and cute, giving the example of cats, which are fearsome hunters. When Kusunoki says that cats and humans are different, he gives the example of Elsie, who appears dressed in a suit of armor she made with her Raiment and jumps off the play structure, rending the earth. In the end, the feminine side agrees to go to sleep as long as Kusunoki will eventually get around to satisfying her, but she takes control of Kusunoki's body and forces her to kiss Keima, allowing Elsie to capture the Loose Soul.

The last five minutes of Episode 2 and the entirety of Episode 3 are devoted to the appearance of Haqua. As I understand it, the manga has three major characters: Keima, Elsie, and Haqua, a classmate of Elsie's who was top of their class and has already been promoted to section chief. Haqua has a huge ego and seems to look down on Elsie, although Elsie considers her a friend. She appears and accidentally captures Elsie in her Loose Soul bottle. Elsie is overjoyed to see her friend again. She seems to have the same hero worship towards Haqua that she has towards Keima—actually, it seems to be even deeper with Haqua. Elsie thinks that Haqua and Keima will get along well, but as usual, Keima makes a bad impression by ignoring Haqua and doing a weird dance on the bench so his PFP will get enough internet reception for him to receive a special net-based event in his latest game. Elsie receives a message from Chief Dokuro that another demon let a Loose Soul escape and it fled into her area. Haqua goes off to hunt it down, refusing to work with Elsie, but she doesn't get very far since she doesn't know her way around the school. Keima offers to help her in between more weird dancing for wi-fi reception; at first Haqua spurns his help and thinks he's totally worthless, but Keima casually reveals how he figured out that Haqua let the Loose Soul escape and Haqua is taken aback by his unexpected intelligence. Keima agrees not to tell Elsie, and they send Elsie off to search by the edge of the school grounds, where she gets distracted watching fire trucks go by. Their search eventually leads them to the old theater, where Keima is about to turn around and leave Haqua to do the capturing. Haqua won't let him leave, and finally reveals that she hasn't captured a single Loose Soul, contrary to the lie she told Elsie earlier about having caught ten. (When Elsie says she's captured five, Haqua laughs and says she doesn't have to lie because no one will be surprised that she hasn't captured any.) Then Elsie calls and tells them she's trapped upstairs with the Loose Soul and a bunch of passed out theater club members. The episode ends there.

The previews and everything make a big deal about Haqua's appearance, because she was so major in the manga, but I didn't really remember liking her that much. Of course, her big draws are that a) She's a tsundere, and b) The object of her tsun-tsun and dere-dere love love is Keima. Maybe you have to read the manga to get it, but I still don't like her as much as Elsie, Kanon, or Shiori. Still, she might grow on me, because I often like tsundere characters, and the way her appearance was handled was a good demonstration of the principles one needs for a good tsundere character that I mentioned in my essay on why I like tsundere characters. A frequent characteristic of tsundere characters is an obsession with worth and personal status—this probably started with the ones that were rich and migrated to the ones that aren't. In Haqua's case, though, it's not money or social class, but skill and performance. She looks down on Elsie because Elsie isn't smart and skillful like she is. She looks down on Keima because he's a human and because he works with Elsie and initially comes off as an idiot, but Keima is also intelligent and skillful, the qualities Haqua values. In fact, he's so smart and skillful that he outdoes Haqua and sees through her lies (which were only ever meant to trick the fairly dim-witted Elsie, but with Haqua's huge ego, she probably never expected anyone to see through them—certainly not someone who played video games and ignored her through their entire first meeting). That sets up the tsundere scales that keep tipping between tsun-tsun and dere-dere: Haqua is in love with Keima because he's smart and skillful, but she's angry at herself for falling in love with a human who works with Elsie. 

I also like how Haqua and her ego are deflated during Episode 3. The writers understood that a character with no flaws and a huge ego to boot won't usually be well-received by the audience, and they set up the scenes where Keima figures out that Haqua let the Loose Soul escape and where Haqua admits that she hasn't captured any Loose Souls. Not only do those scenes deflate Haqua a little and let the audience like and sympathize with her, they also become dere-dere scenes between Haqua and Keima.

I couldn't say I was crazy about Haqua this time either, but she did get pretty cute at the end when she first tried to get Keima to stay, and then admitted to him that she hadn't caught any Loose Souls. I don't like her constantly hitting Keima with her scythe (too much like Naru from the Love Hina anime, with the constant, annoying slapstick), but I could end up liking her more than last time.


I should mention that another one of Haqua's appealing characteristics is her tomboyish voice, provided by Saori Hayami with the same tone as Ayase Aragaki in Ore Imo. She fits really well into Kami Nomi's cast of great voice actresses—Ayana Taketatsu, Aoi Yuuki, Nao Toyama, and Kana Hanazawa from the first season, plus Kanae Ito as Elsie. Later on in this season we have Kana Asumi (Popura!) as Chihiro. Ami Koshimizu did the voice of Kusunoki; I've only seen her in School Rumble as Tsukamoto Tenma, but I know she's in a lot of shows and she did a good job as Kusunoki. (Come to think of it, didn't she play Code Geass's Kallen?) Keima is also well-voiced by Hiro Shimono as always. 

** Thoughts on Episode 4, Tuesday, September 11th, 2012:

Episode 4 completes the Haqua story arc. As I mentioned in my original thoughts on the second series, Haqua is sort of like the fourth girl of this series. The first series had the single-episode Ayumi story, the two-episode Mio story, a bonus episode, the three-episode Kanon story, another bonus episode, the three-episode Shiori story, and the final episode, also a bonus story. The second series has the two-episode Kusunoki story, then the two-episode Haqua story, then goes straight into Chihiro's story, followed by a bonus episode, Nagase's story, and the final episode. You could also think of Haqua's story as bonus episodes (as I did when I first saw it, before I had finished watching the series), but the bonus episodes are usually comedy and don't involve any loose soul capturing, whereas Haqua's two episodes have normal proportions of comedy and drama and involve the capture of a loose soul.

This is where Haqua's true moe power appears. She's still not as adorable as Elsie (not many are), but she becomes much more adorable than she was. The loose soul uses theater club members to attack Elsie and Haqua while Haqua is trying to capture it. They are overcome, and the loose soul escapes, because Elsie can't use her raiment well enough to contain so many targets at once. Haqua gets angry and runs off after the loose soul alone, despite Keima's advice to take Elsie. On the roof, she finds the loose soul gone and sits down to reminisce about how things were in school, where she was beloved and praised and regarded as among the finest of demons; she remembers being awarded her scythe and how happy she was, and reflects that nothing in the real world works like it was taught in school; the loose souls' movements are much harder to predict, and she hasn't even been able to find a human buddy (like Keima) to help her drive loose souls out of people. 

When Elsie and Keima reach the roof, they find that Haqua has been taken over by the loose soul. The loose soul holds down Elsie with theater club members and tries to have Haqua kill her. Keima tells Elsie that Haqua is troubled and that Elsie has to drive the loose soul out of her. Elsie is able to avoid death with her initial attempts, but Haqua doesn't come back to herself until Elsie breaks free and squeezes Haqua in a glomp (as she unsuccessfully tried to do back in Episode 2), telling her that to Elsie, she'll always be a wonderful demon and that if not for Haqua's tutelage, Elsie wouldn't be on the Loose Souls team. Haqua breaks free of the loose soul's control. This time, she uses her raiment to hold down the theater club members while Elsie captures the loose soul; when Elsie is unsure, Haqua admits that Elsie has more experience capturing them. They capture the loose soul together and Elsie gives it to Haqua. Haqua goes to Keima and thanks him for his help, telling him he's actually a pretty good person because he didn't tell Elsie that Haqua hadn't captured a single loose soul. She offers to let Keima shake her hand after all, even though Keima's earlier insolence had caused her to withdraw that offer. This time, though, it's not Haqua egotistically offering to let the lowly Keima come in contact with her greatness; Haqua actually regards Keima as a friend (or something), since he's shown his worth by keeping her secrets and guiding her and Elsie to the final victory over the loose soul. They shake hands, and Haqua leaves. Keima actually compliments Elsie, which makes her so happy that she offers to buy him one of those disgusting omelet soba sandwiches that Mio bought a hundred of in Episode 2, even though it's nighttime. The next day, Haqua shows up again and wants two of them. (Is she planning to eat two by herself, or was she ordering for Keima as well?)

Haqua actually had some pretty cute moments in this episode, especially when she's sad because she can't find a buddy, and when she thanks Keima for his help. She also brought out even more adorableness from Elsie. I thought it was really cute how Elsie puts everyone up on a pedestal and how she was convinced that Keima and Haqua would get along well. She must be smarter than everyone thinks, because she was right. 

I don't know if this is something that most people would agree with, but I sort of feel like they dropped the ball in the second series when it comes to the endings. The first series had an intensely cute ending sequence with the adorable song "Koi no Shirushi" in five versions, one for each heroine and one for Elsie, plus the extra endings "Tatta Ichido no Kiseki" and "Shuuseki Kairo no Yume". The second series has a rather simple ending sequence and only one song, "Ai no Yokan", although I feel like the Episode 4 version was different (it sounded like the main parts were sung by Kanae Ito and Saori Hayami alone, rather than all the heroines like the regular version). 

** Thoughts on the Chihiro Story Arc, Friday, September 14th, 2012:

Last night I finished watching the Chihiro arc. Now I have to decide whether to stop here and watch the next disc of Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, or go on. 

The Chihiro arc was really interesting for a lot of different reasons. For one thing, Chihiro and Keima never establish a really solid relationship like Keima does with the other girls. Even Shiori, with whom he barely spoke, seemed to recognize that he was of the same ilk as her, and Keima himself definitely felt a sympathy with Shiori. Given how the story begins, though, and the bizarre path forward that it takes, it's entirely sensible that Keima and Chihiro never form a solid romance. The story is also interesting artistically, because the whole thing takes place during a rainy spell, so everything is under a steel-grey sky and has an oppressive, melancholic cast to it. Chihiro even appears in the opening with an umbrella, because she's never without one during her story since it takes place during a rainstorm. The rain is also used as a symbol for the progress of the story—the storm begins in the first part, when Keima and Elsie happen to see Chihiro confess her love to the captain of the soccer team, get rejected, and run away crying. The rain begins as Chihiro flies the scene in tears. 

Elsie and Chihiro sit together in class and are something like friends, even though Chihiro was the one who read Elsie's note to Keima out loud in Episode 2, letting the entire class hear about the incident that happened in the bath. Chihiro also gave Elsie the recipe for the cake she tried to make in Episode 8 of the first series. When Elsie sees that Chihiro hasn't come to school, she's worried, although Keima claims not to care because she's just a background character with no personality. He said something like this earlier too, and ever since, has vociferously refused to try and conquer Chihiro and drive out the loose soul, saying that they can let this one go, just like when Haqua let one escape. When Chihiro shows up, Keima acts as if he's going to try and console her and move towards capturing the loose soul, but Chihiro suddenly says cheerfully that she's given up on that guy and has a new target. Keima gets mad and yells at her for not taking anything seriously, since she's not in a club, has mediocre grades, and doesn't even try that hard to get dates. Chihiro yells back that he's not any better and calls him a cockroach. Keima is so crushed that he hides in his room for some unspecified period of time, ignoring his mother's and Elsie's attempts to get him to come out and eat, before finally appearing one morning and walking off to school without speaking to anyone. Once at school, though, he collapses from hunger and looks up to see Ayumi standing above him.

Ayumi definitely doesn't feel the same way about Keima as she did in Episode 1 of the first series. Not only does she act friendly and address him as "Katsuragi" instead of "Otamega", she also shares her secret stash of food with him. (Though she objects to being called "Ayumi" with yobisute, which Keima does unconsciously, thinking back to when they kissed.) Ayumi tells Keima that she heard about what happened between him and Chihiro, and for some reason that she can't explain, she doesn't like hearing him badmouthed. Since she and Chihiro are friends, she wants Keima to make up with Chihiro. After Ayumi leaves, Elsie flies down and Keima asks why Ayumi seems to remember him somehow. Elsie says that even though conquered girls lose their memories, they're not the same as before, because the emptiness in their hearts is filled (we also saw this with Mio, when she decided to try taking off her platform boots and being normal, and asked Keima how to make change with reasonable politeness). 

Ayumi and Keima were supposed to clean the classroom together, but Ayumi makes an excuse and gets Chihiro stuck there with him. Chihiro freaks out when she sees the boy she currently likes in the hallway and pulls Keima to the floor. Keima asks what she knows about him, and Chihiro replies that she doesn't know much, whereupon Keima criticizes her for attempting a conquest without having any information. He says his success rate is 100%, even if it is in games, but when Chihiro gets angry at him and asks if he's ever kissed or held hands, Keima blushes, recalls the previous five conquests, and says that it wasn't that big of a deal, prompting Chihiro to pounce on him and ask for details. Keima ends up agreeing to help her conquer her current crush, Yuta-kun; he hopes that Yuta-kun can fill the emptiness in her heart and dislodge the loose soul without him having to conquer a girl he finds contemptible.

As I said above, I thought this scene was really interesting because it's hard to tell whether Keima is actually blushing at the memory of the five girls he's kissed, or whether it was an act designed to hook Chihiro and convince her he could deliver. There's some evidence that he actually feels affection towards the girls he's conquered, especially his reaction to seeing Ayumi again earlier in this story, and the way he acts after leaving Kanon's concert during the first series. Keima talks as if gal games are just an intellectual exercise to him, but in Episode 12 of the first series, he does have emotional responses to the games, so it seems plausible that he acts with complete objectivity until he reaches the "ending", then allows himself to become emotional so he can make the impassioned speech that helps fill the emptiness in the girl's heart. Some of the emotion of that final moment may remain with him afterwards, and recalling that could be what made him blush when Chihiro accused him of having no real life experience. Either way, it was perfectly timed, because Chihiro probably would have accused him of lying if he directly claimed to have real world experience; this way it just seemed like a spontaneous slip. Lelouch couldn't have done that. (Light Yagami probably could have, though.)

Keima puts tons of effort into his first conquest of a man, using tactics that have served him well in the past, like making a bad first impression to make someone aware of his existence (looking back on the first series, he did this with both Kanon and Shiori, the two most difficult girls to make an impression on—Kanon because of her fame, and Shiori because of her shyness). Chihiro seems sort of lukewarm through all of this, refusing to read his pages and pages of predicted conversations and forcing Keima to follow her and Yuta-kun around, invisible under Elsie's raiment, and whisper lines to her. One day, while plotting outside in the rain, Chihiro suddenly starts talking about random things she saw on TV, annoying Keima. (Chihiro watches a lot of TV, and is a fan of Kanon.) Keima tells her that she's going to confess her love to Yuta-kun the next day. The weather report that night says that there will be sun the next day, signaling that the story is coming to an end.

The next day, Chihiro is late to their love confession practice, so Keima sends Elsie to find her. She shows up with pork buns that she stopped to buy at the convenience store. While eating them, Chihiro comments that maybe they shouldn't go through with the confession, because she doesn't really like Yuta-kun that much anyway. Keima gets mad and yells at her, saying that it wasn't like this with any of the others because they all worked hard and tried their best at what they were doing. Chihiro gets angry and runs off. Elsie finds Keima alone in the rain, beating himself up because he concentrated too much on the guy and ignored Chihiro herself, who did have parameters after all. Keima decides that he'll complete the conquest himself and goes after her. He finds her on a ship in the bay and they talk. Chihiro tells him that since she's plain, she tends to be attracted to people who are shining; she thought he would understand her feelings, but he doesn't since he gives everything to gaming. Keima convinces her that she can reshape reality, then kisses her, and says that he'll be there for her. Unlike earlier conquests, it's not the kiss, but the last line that drives out the loose soul. Chihiro decides that she wants to start a band and do lead vocals, and even though she's no good at singing, she's going to try her hardest. The story ends with Keima complaining that the parameters were too weak and his PFP got soaked with rain, concluding that the real world really is a crappy game after all, but then reflecting that Kusunoki, Haqua, and Chihiro are all fighting against the limits of reality. 

The second series had plots that were a little more knotty, ambiguous, and undecidable than those of the first series. In the first series, Ayumi wins her track meet, Mio adjusts to her new life, Kanon overcomes her doubts and makes her concert a huge success, and Shiori manages to speak up and make herself heard. In the second series, Kusunoki's feminine side gives up and waits for some unspecified future time to assert itself; both sides reject Keima's suggestion of becoming a cute, strong martial artist. Haqua manages to admit her failures to Elsie, but she's still left with the disappointment of learning how different real loose soul capturing is from school, and of knowing that Elsie is beating her. Chihiro finally leaves her prison of apathy, but must now confront the fact that she's (apparently) not much good at anything and work hard to do something with herself. From what I remember, Nagase's story is also much more ambiguous and uncertain than the ones from the first series. Correspondingly, the second series also contains fewer of those "Iron Chef chairman" moments where Keima reveals his wisdom from games in a weird haiku-like form, as his game knowledge becomes less useful.

** Thoughts on Episodes 8 and 9, written Sunday, September 16th, 2012:

Episode 8 is the first of the second series's bonus episodes. I'm always impressed with how much material Kami Nomi can cram into a single episode—Episode 1 of the first series somehow manages to set up the entire premise and still have time left for Ayumi's story. Episode 8 is split into two parts; in the first part, Keima tutors Elsie in gaming knowledge so he can send her to buy a rare first edition game for him while he attends a retro game fair at a nearby store. Elsie ends up screwing up, but she does it in such an understandable and sympathetic way that it's impossible to be mad at her, and Keima isn't, since he bought the game at the fair just in case. Elsie accidentally buys the anime series, which Keima comments is pretty boring.

In the second part, Haqua comes over and interrupts Keima's day of gaming to ask for his and Elsie's help filling out the details of her report on what happened during her story. Rather than just write it down, she's made a model of the school with tiny animated dolls that move according to the events dictated into a microphone. While Elsie makes tea and assembles cookies, Keima and Haqua fill in the chronicle. Keima takes exception to Haqua's reinterpretation of what happened when they entered the theater building; Haqua narrates that Keima clung to her in fright. Keima seizes the microphone and changes it, saying that Haqua clung to him in a pathetic manner (not exactly true, but closer to what really happened); Haqua takes it back, says that Keima is a pervert, and smashes it so Keima can't change it again. The Keima doll begins chasing the Haqua doll, and as Haqua gloats over her victory, she looks down and sees the Keima doll having sex with the Haqua doll. Elsie comes along right at that moment and thinks that they were downstairs getting it on while she was alone in the dark with the loose soul and unconscious theater club members all around. She throws the teapot at Keima, shattering the glass pyramid containing the model and letting the dolls escape.

As Haqua gets ready to leave, Elsie apologizes for ruining it, but Haqua says it was her own fault for playing around. She tells Elsie, in an adorable moment, that Elsie did a good job capturing that loose soul and is no longer a failure. She also offers to let Keima shake her hand again. As Keima goes to do it, he grumbles that she should write her own reports; Haqua slaps his hand away and says she knows how to write reports before flying away. This prompts Elsie to wonder if Haqua just came to visit--in Japanese, she leaves the subject unstated, so Keima assumes she was going to say that Haqua had come to see her, but it seems more probable that Elsie is starting to realize that Haqua has a crush on Keima and came to see him. After all, Haqua spent almost the whole time with Keima, making the model, seemed to have fun playing around with him, and even complimented him on the precision of his recall of events. Haqua's statement that she knows how to write her own reports was made with chagrin, because Keima didn't realize that the report was just an excuse to see him. Haqua was pretty cute in this sequence, and I certainly see how it could take someone from another world to appreciate Keima—Elsie seems to be pretty much his first and only friend. I still think he made a good pair with Kanon, though.

Episode 9 begins the Jun Nagase story arc. I made a totally unexpected discovery at the end of this episode—Nagase is voiced by Aki Toyosaki. Yui! They should have made Nagase hug Ayumi and call her "Ayu-nyan". I was blindsided by this discovery, and I went back and listened to her voice to see if I could hear any Yui-ness in it. I could hear just the barest hint of the unique rolling rhythm and scratchy quality of the voices of Yui or Iori Nagase from Kokoro Connect. I suspect Nagase's voice is closer to her real voice. Anyway, it felt a little weird when I realized that Nagase, at twenty-one years old, is actually younger than me, even though she's supposed to be the mature teacher. 

One thing that fits with Aki Toyosaki's typecasting is that Nagase is cheerful, energetic, and strange. She was a kouhai of Nikaido, Keima and Elsie's Japanese literature teacher. She loves pro wrestling and includes in her introduction of herself to both the teachers and the students that her hero is pro wrestler Jumbo Tsuruma. I don't think he's a real Japanese pro wrestler (maybe he is), but he's no longer alive, and is so retro that no one in the class has heard of him. (Elsie is actually six hundred years old, but she doesn't seem like the pro wrestling type.) From the moment Nagase enters the class, she notices Keima with his Virtual Boy helmet, ignoring everything around him. Later, when she brings him up, thinking he's a garden variety problem child, the other teachers fill her with stories about him. The PE teacher complains that Keima plays games while swimming; when the teacher tried to take away his PFP, he just kept pulling out more of them until the teacher had to give up. Kodama, the English teacher in the horrible suit who probably isn't qualified to teach English to the translators of Zero Wing for the Sega Genesis, says that he yelled at Keima about how it was impossible to pay attention in class while playing games. Keima took that to mean that if he could show he was paying attention, it was fine to play games, and asked if acing every test was good enough proof. Ever since then, he's gotten 100 on every English test. Even Keima's mother hates Kodama, since (as we see later in this story) the man is a jerk in addition to barely being able to pronounce English, and Nagase comes to dislike him as well.

Nagase is determined to make progress with Keima, and tries going up to him on a break and telling him that it's fine to play games, but he should spend time with his friends as well. Keima looks up at her and says "Friends?", and Nagase runs away, later thinking that the look in his eyes was terrible, as if he'd completely given up on reality. She decides that she will get to him, and a loose soul enters her. When Keima and Elsie discover this, Keima decides to go home, because he must avoid seeing Nagase at school if he wants to conquer her. In games, Keima says, teachers are hard to get close to; their paths are long and torturous and contain tons of events, because their job is to be friendly to students and it's hard to get past the "student" wall. Keima wants to avoid being trapped in this route, but Nagase ambushes him at the school gates and invites him to have lunch with her. Keima has his first real moment of not being on the ball as a hyper genius; not having had time to think of a plan, and confronted with the exact situation he wanted to avoid, he panics and tries to run away, but Nagase bodily drags him off to eat with her. Keima does his best not to respond to her. Nagase shows him a picture of Jumbo Tsuruma on her cell phone and says that she prefers pro wrestling to the more popular mixed martial arts, because mixed martial arts is the pursuit of real strength, but pro wrestling is the pursuit of ideal strength. Keima responds "So you choose the ideal over the real" and Nagase is happy that she got him to respond, while Keima is horrified that he did so, leaving him trapped in the "teacher" route.

At this point, Keima's miscalculation and ensuing panic don't really hurt his image as a hyper genius, because he's already been well established in that role. Not only that, the slip-up came more from the unpredictability of Nagase than from a deficiency on Keima's part. Actually, as we see shortly after, Keima had no idea that he was viewed as a problem child by the teachers; when Elsie mentions it, he's taken by complete surprise at the suggestion. But even if he'd realized this, he had no way of knowing that Nagase had decided to reform him and would seek him out. Altogether, it fits well into the story and doesn't make him look stupid like Lelouch's numerous screw-ups (letting a cat steal his Zero mask, somehow thinking Suzaku would join his rebellion, accidentally ordering Euphemia to kill all Japanese) did. I think it's funny that the parody of Lelouch is smarter than the original, but, as we've seen numerous times, Tamiki Wakaki is a rather good writer, and probably better than the Code Geass writers, and that carries through to the anime. 

** Thoughts on Episode 10, Monday, September 17th, 2012:

In Episode 10, Nagase begins a fresh offensive to try and make Keima love school. Keima, meanwhile, is doing his best to make her angry, figuring that he might be able to break out of the teacher route. Unfortunately, as we see later, the only thing that makes Nagase mad is a lackadaisical attitude, so Keima's efforts are all doomed. He tries playing games in study hall, surrounded by a stack of cases and wearing his Virtual Boy helmet, but Nagase just places a friendly hand on his shoulder and smiles. His efforts during PE, when Nagase sees him playing games alone and tries to get him to practice soccer with her, just get him kicked to hell by Nikaido. He tries wedging an eraser in the door and getting it to fall on Nagase, but Elsie instead falls victim to this trap. And when Elsie reads a Fujio Akatsuki gag manga (I think that's who that manga-ka is) where a student flips up the teacher's skirt and suggests Keima try that, Keima refuses (so he's not totally shameless). Keima's failure ends with Nagase tracking him down after class and showing him the PFP that she bought, claiming to be an avid gamer. But like other Aki Toyosaki characters, she's sort of a ditz; she didn't even bother figuring out how to turn it on, and Keima gets annoyed and tells her. Nagase plays for a while, then tells Keima that she can see why he finds games so fun, but that he has to also live in the real world. Nagase is under the impression that Keima only plays games because he's lonely and wants to escape the real world; when Keima realizes this, he gets angry and yells at her. He's about to go too far and ruin his chances of conquering her, but Elsie comes along and removes him from the situation. Later, Keima thinks that it's easier in games because the main character has no personality, and this time it's his own parameters getting in the way.

Keima decides that the best strategy is to try and get closer to Nagase's sempai, Nikaido, and use her to get closer to Nagase. He knows he's in for an uphill battle, though. (While watching from the balcony with Elsie, Keima sees Nikaido walk up to the three delinquents that beat up Keima in Episode 1 and have so far refused to obey Nagase's orders to stop littering. Nikaido doesn't screw around; she just kicks one of them right in the stomach and screams at the three.) Nikaido knows Keima's up to something, but she still lets him grade all her papers while playing his PFP and complaining that the dialogue in his gal games isn't grammatical. Keima breaks down and asks her directly for information on Nagase, but Nikaido's price for the information is too horrible to be borne.

Meanwhile, Nagase is arguing with Kodama, the English teacher, over the pedagogical value of yelling at students and calling them failures. Kodama claims that he does it to show the students what the real world is like. The students in Keima's class are starting to get tired of Nagase and her permanent energy and overflowing passion; when Nagase tries to tutor the student who Kodama yelled at so he can teach Kodama a lesson, the student refuses. Other students come in for him and tell Nagase that they don't mind being called failures because that's just how it goes. Nagase gets angry and asks if they're stupid, then realizes her terrible lapse and runs away. When Keima sees her walking home, looking dejected and depressed, he goes back to the faculty room and asks Nikaido. Nikaido doesn't want to talk, and Keima surmises that it has something to do with her as well. He ends up finding out, thanks to the PE teacher and Nikaido, that Nagase used to be captain of the basketball team when she was in school. But the team has been shut down ever since she left school. The episode ends with Keima declaring that he can now move things along at his own pace.

Chihiro was a challenge for Keima—partially because of her personality, partly because of his—and Nagase is an even bigger challenge, stretching Keima's ability to the limit. I think it's interesting seeing him work in such difficult circumstances. It shows his true hyper genius powers to put him in difficult situations and see him work his way out of it. That was what made the hyper geniuses of Death Note look so smart—they were constantly in difficult situations with nothing but their wits to get them out. I hope they come out with a third series, or the manga in English, so we can see the story develop more. I want to know what happens with Haqua's crush on Keima. 

** Thoughts on Episode 11, written Tuesday, September 18th, 2012:

Episode 11 concludes the Nagase story arc, and here we see the downside of the fantastically difficult and complicated structure that's been built up over these three episodes: it makes a clean, sensible conclusion very difficult. As I said above, endings in the second series tend to be dark, ambiguous, and messy, and the ending of the Nagase story is all of those things.

Nagase is still depressed over the confrontation she had with the students, but she's decided to go to a pro wrestling match and try to forget about it. In the crowd outside the match, Keima has Elsie sneak up and get a look at Nagase's ticket, then make a fake copy with her raiment. He then finds her seat and occupies it; when Nagase arrives and is dismayed to find that her seat was apparently double-booked, Keima convinces her to share it with him. The close physical proximity makes both of them a bit uncomfortable—Nagase feels that a teacher and student shouldn't get so close. For a while, though, she really enjoys the match and has fun playing around with Keima, putting him in headlocks and forcing him to stand up and yell with the crowd. But Keima induces Nagase to talk about how a pro wrestling match works because everyone—the wrestlers, the referee, the sponsors, and the audience—all contribute to make it work, and Keima brings up Nagase's stint on the basketball team. He asks if she thinks that what she did as captain was for the good of the others. Nagase is nonplussed and ends up leaving the match. As Keima watches her leave, he finally gets to declare "Endingu ga mieta zo."

Several flashbacks and monologues reveal what Nagase's real problem is: she has a strong ideal about how an organization like a basketball team or a classroom should run, but others involved don't share her passion. Nagase does not respond well to this and accuses the others of being selfish, which leads them to become angry and leave, or refuse to go along with her. Keima also a strong ideal about how things should be, but has decided that it cannot be realized in the real world and has abandoned the real world for the game world. In fact, Nagase probably exemplifies better than any of the heroines what Keima observed at the end of the Chihiro story, that everyone was fighting against reality. Having made this observation about Nagase, Keima's plan for the conquest was to let her self-destruct, to let the weight of her ideals crush the class just as it had crushed the basketball team, then to be the one who was there to pick her up again from the rubble. 

He finally achieves this goal when Nagase, trying to get the class to bond, signs everyone up for a marathon. The class has been whispering about her ever since the incident at the end of the previous episode, and this just confirms all their worst suspicions. They try to tell her that they're all busy and don't have time or desire, and Nagase yells at them that they're all selfish and runs out of the room in tears. Keima comments that he doesn't know why she even tries to fix such a bunch of buggy idiots, then disappears. Nagase goes to the basketball team locker room, where Keima pops out of her locker. Nagase actually loses control, yells at him for being creepy, and tells him it's all his fault that she's in this situation to begin with because he threw her off. Keima points out all the parallels between this situation and what happened with the basketball team, asking how many people need to be crushed under her ideals before she realizes what she's doing. Nagase asks what she's supposed to do, and Keima takes Nagase's hand and says there's nothing to do but keep trying, because people get nervous when confronted with an ideal, and the only way to make them live it is to keep on pounding them with it until they accept it. The class appears at the door of the gym (where the conversation has moved to) and apologizes for what happened. 

After the basketball match, Keima had predicted that Nagase was on the edge of self-destructing, and knew what he needed to do to achieve an ending. He left Elsie instructions saying what he would do. After Nagase left the room, he would insult the class and make them mad, making himself look like the bad guy and taking their anger away from Nagase, then leave himself. Elsie was to count to five hundred after he left, then suggest that they all go look for Nagase. Keima probably knew that there were people in the class with personalities closer to Nagase who would take her side and support Elsie—the person who does turns out to be Ayumi, who tells everyone they were too hard on Nagase. Chihiro accuses her of being just as bad as Nagase, but everyone still follows her and Elsie's lead. (I wanted Nagase to know about this so she could hug Ayumi and call her Ayu-nyan!) The scene cuts to the final day of Nagase's training period. Everyone seems to like her again, and they all give her a good sendoff, though Elsie notes that Keima hasn't been to school ever since the day of the ending. As Nagase leaves the school, she sees Keima standing along the path playing his PFP. She apologizes and says she thought he was a cold and lonely person. Keima tells her she'd better come back. Nagase says she'll become a great teacher, and this is the last time he'll see her as anything other than a teacher, then kisses him. As Elsie is standing on the balcony looking over the school, she remembers that the loose soul was never dislodged, then sees it fly by. 

Now, on the surface, this seems like a fairly straightforward ending, but there are numerous reasons why it's not so clear-cut. Keima may have just created a monster; instead of convincing Nagase to dial it down, he convinced her that she needs to step it up, that with enough effort, she can get others on board with her ideals. This approach has already led to trouble for Nagase when applied to the real world; this approach doubled will probably lead to double the trouble, for Nagase and for whoever she ends up working with in the future. The class doesn't actually accept her ideals, they just start to feel sorry for her and ashamed of themselves because of what Keima, Elsie, and Ayumi say. On the other hand, it's possible that all this could go better in the future, because Nagase's fundamental problem was that she didn't understand why everyone else wouldn't go along with her, and got angry and threw a tantrum. Maybe Keima's advice will convince her to bring the same patience she brought to her attempts to reform him to future attempts to impose her ideals on a classroom. Maybe in future classes, her equally passionate but more subtle approach will lead the class to follow her ideals because they feel the same shame and pity that Keima, Elsie, and Ayumi instilled in their class. 

The class doesn't actually accept Nagase's passion, but she either thinks they have or thinks that she has an in to make it happen. The purpose behind getting them to come find her was to give Nagase something tangible to help steel her resolve to do as Keima says and continue trying to make her ideal come to pass. Keima must have thought this was necessary to fill the emptiness in her heart. What I find somewhat strange is how all this makes her fall in love with Keima. I see why it fills the emptiness in her heart, which was presumably a product of the gap between her ideals and reality. The loose soul entered her just when she decided to try and reform Keima, which was probably a moment when she was contemplating the difference between an ideal class and a real one with people like Keima, who are totally uninterested in school. But I don't quite see how this translates into love for Keima, which I assume she must have, since she came up and kissed him under her own volition, unlike the similar case with Mio back in the first series, when Keima kissed her. Mio also seemed merely flustered and thrown off by Keima's actions. On the other hand, Nagase came at Keima thinking of him as nothing but a troubled high school student. We twenty-somethings can get pretty superior when it comes to teenagers. Maybe she actually fell in love with him gradually, seeing that he was intelligent and perceptive and thinking about how he helped her come to a new perspective of herself. 

There's only one episode of Kami Nomi left, the Yokkyun episode, where Keima experiences what many of us did the first time we watched Kanon and becomes entranced by a weirdly drawn character. I'm sad that it's over. I'd really like to read some of the manga, to see what happens with the Haqua subplot, to know what girls appear in future stories, to find out what happens to Keima and Elsie. I guess this show wasn't popular enough to make anyone consider bringing it out, though. I'd like to sneer that it was too intelligent for anyone to get, but I kind of understand how someone who didn't give it a second or third look might not appreciate it. I didn't like it much the first time I watched it, and I thought it was just okay the second time. I had to watch it several times, to see the depth, and to learn more about gal games, before I could really appreciate Kami Nomi. I understand why most people wouldn't really want to put in that kind of effort for a simple moe comedy. 

** Thoughts on Episode 12, Wednesday, September 19th, 2012:

There isn't a lot to say about Episode 12. Keima finally plays One Leaf, the game he bought from the discount bin back in Episode 8, assured that the game will be terrible because of the strange looking art. He starts it up, though, and becomes immediately entranced by the main character, Yotsuba Sugimoto. Even though the art is weird, the story is, as he later tells Elsie, closer to his ideal than any other game he's played. The first part of the episode makes a point of showing every girl from the series so far in the background. The episode begins with Elsie watching Kanon on TV and singing along to her song "Uraha Love" (it's utterly adorable—the song is pretty good, but when I listen to it without the adorableness of Elsie singing along, it's not half as good). Kusunoki runs by with a contingent of new karate club girls while Keima and Elsie go to school, and they pass a convenience store where Nagase is working. Chihiro and Ayumi chime in to comment when Keima gets thrown out of the class by Nikaido for being too vocal in his love for Yotsuba (who he begins calling "Yokkyun" after choosing that option of address in a scene of the game). Mio is shown leaving the food stall with a disgusting omelet soba sandwich during lunchtime, and at the end of the day, we see Shiori locking up the library and leaving for the day. Finally, Haqua shows up at the cafe and utterly fails to conceal from Elsie that she came to see Keima. Elsie draws Yokkyun for her and is puzzled when Haqua says she's terrible at drawing. Elsie takes Haqua to Keima's room to see Yokkyun (who Keima has on all six of his monitors at once) and Haqua says she can't believe that such a scrawl is in a game, prompting Keima to get angry and chase them away, yelling at them not to make fun of Yokkyun. 

The first time I watched this episode, I didn't pick up until I saw the "B's Ware" logo on the game's startup screen that Yokkyun and the game "One Leaf" are parodies of Key and Itaru Hinoue's art. I loved this because I've always thought the art in the game of Kanon looked weird, despite my love for the story and characters, and I was glad to see that someone agreed with me. By Clannad, Hinoue's art was a lot less weird; you can see the contrast by looking at the episode preview art she did for an episode in the first series, where she drew Keima and Elsie, with Keima holding up a PSP displaying Yokkyun. Yokkyun's face is a weird shape and her mouth is really high up, right below her nose, which is pretty close to how the art looked in the Kanon visual novel. But Kanon was the show that convinced me that visual novels were capable of yielding high quality stories, and I'd expect a connoisseur like Keima to love something like that. 

In the second half of the episode, Keima gets an e-mail from B's Ware asking for his advice on making their new game, as the God of Conquest. He is thrilled, but finds himself unable to decide what he wants them to include and finally just writes them and asks that they make the best game they can. In the final scene, Keima says in voiceover that he was able to find an ideal in a crappy game; since reality is also a crappy game, this means there may be an ideal path through reality as well. Under the credits, we see girls that weren't in either anime. These include Tenri, who seems to have a split personality; Tsukiyo, a goth-loli tsundere who only loves beautiful things; and Minami, who is in the last year of middle school and is on the swim team.

I also downloaded some illegal scanlations of the manga. (I couldn't stand it.) The translation quality is really abysmal. One group is particularly bad; another is decent, but not great. I can understand the confusion over Elsie's name at least partially (though I don't understand why they immediately went for spellings like 'Elsee' and 'Elsea' instead of the seemingly more obvious 'Elsie'), but a lot of the lines are hard to understand because they're not even in idiomatic English. Some of them are translated way too literally from Japanese, and others are just a mess. In one early chapter, the word "buddy" is translated back into English as "baddy", which context alone should have shown to be ridiculous. Kami Nomi deserves better than this. Anyway, this is how I know about Tsukiyo and Minami. I learned about Tenri from doujinshi.

The art is actually not among the best I've ever seen—the quality of the scan is pretty terrible, which doesn't help anything, but the character designs start out a little odd. Ayumi has a huge head. By about the third chapter, though, it all evens out and becomes pretty good-looking. Haqua somehow looks much cuter in the manga, and nothing can dampen Elsie's adorableness. For some reason, Kanon's last name was changed in the anime—in the manga it was "Nishihara", while in the anime it's "Nakagawa". At first I thought this might be the translators screwing up, but I could see the kanji for myself in one shot. (Also, her stun gun isn't cat-shaped.)

There are some really good bonus chapters that weren't in the anime, like one where Mari fantasizes about having a decent son instead of Keima. Elsie conspires to get them to spend time together and Mari ends up getting frustrated with Keima ignoring her and trying to run off, as well as being angry because he doesn't seem to remember that it's her birthday. It turns out that Keima's father contacted him and asked him to buy a present for Mari from both of them; Keima was trying to sneak out and buy it so he could surprise her, but Elsie made things more difficult for him. We also get to see Haqua's buddy, a weird-looking woman in her fifties who loves infomercials. Keima surmises that the demons don't choose their own buddies, which explains why the e-mail that initiated Keima's contract was from Dokuro, Elsie's superior, and not Elsie herself. Dokuro probably knew that Elsie would need an extraordinary partner to succeed and hooked her up with Keima. (Jury's out on whether he knew Keima was the god of the video game world and also knew it wouldn't matter, or whether he screwed up.) Yukie, Haqua's buddy, sells "Gokult" (a takeoff of Yakult) door to door. Haqua gets impatient with her long, drawn out strategy, but Keima, who figured that the higher-ups wouldn't have knowingly assigned Haqua a useless partner, recognizes that she's using a strategy that was often employed in older games, where it's more important to see girls and build time with them, letting the emotion come on its own. Yukie's approach shows results when she manages to dislodge four spirits, bringing Haqua's total up to five. (At this point she's still behind Elsie, who has Ayumi, Mio, Kanon, Shiori, Kusunoki, Chihiro, Nagase, and Tsukiyo, as well as the one Haqua let escape, for a total of nine.)

[March 10th, 2014: The jury is now in with a verdict! In the recent time travel story in the manga, we see that Dokuro orchestrated a large amount of what happened in the series, so she surely did know that Keima was the god of video games and that together with the minimally competent but biddable Elsie, he would become the secret weapon to resurrect the goddesses. But all that comes later.] 

The chapter that leads in to Keima meeting Yukie was also good. Keima comes down from an all-night game session to find that Elsie and Mari have gone shopping. Haqua is laying on the couch waiting for everyone to wake up and come down. Keima tells her they're gone but says if she waits they'll probably be back. Haqua gets bored and challenges Keima to a board game from Hell, thinking that she'll easily beat him since he doesn't know the rules. Keima, wanting information on Hell and the loose souls, wagers with Haqua that the loser of the game has to do anything the winner asks. When Haqua loses, she shrinks away, saying that "anything" didn't really mean "anything", like she thinks he's going to ask for sexual favors, but Keima just asks for information. He beats her about three more times, each time asking for information, until Haqua gets angry and asks why he doesn't want to know anything about her. Keima asks if she has a buddy and Haqua claims she doesn't, but Yukie comes by to pick her up and introduces herself as Haqua's buddy. Keima decides to follow them back to Yukie's house, since he wants to see what information he can learn from Yukie, and gets into her good graces by acting like a polite, well-mannered young man. (Yukie has figured out that Haqua has a crush on Keima and taunts her with it the whole time he's there, leading to another funny scene where she offers Keima a bath. She then tells Haqua that he went home; when Haqua comes in to take a bath, completely naked, she finds him sitting on the edge of the tub, fully clothed and presumably having anticipated some development like this. Haqua flies up to the roof and won't come down.)

By the way, in the manga version of Nagase's story, Keima had even predicted that Ayumi would be the one to take up Elsie's suggestion to go after Nagase.

** More Thoughts on the Manga, Thursday, September 27th, 2012:

I didn't realize how quickly I was reading the manga chapters—I've already read way into the story that seems to be Kami Nomi's equivalent of Rurouni Kenshin's Kyoto arc, the Goddess Hunt story. So far, I'm blown away by how good it is. It shows what you could always see hints of in the earlier stories: that Tamiki Wakaki, far from being a writer who relies exclusively on otaku service for appeal, can write all kinds of different stories, and do them well. 

Before reaching the Goddess Hunt story, though, there were several more conquests, some of which bear directly on the Goddess Hunt. All the girls from the end credits of the second series have now appeared and have been conquered; these are, in addition to the aforementioned Tenri, Tsukiyo, and Minami, creepy kid Airi (the actual target is her ancestor, Rieko, who is a ghost) and ramen shop girl Sumire. There are also a few more that weren't in the end credits of the second series: Yui Goidou, daughter of a rich traditional family; Nanaka Haibara, a master shogi player; Hinoki Kasuga, elder sister of Kusunoki; and Akari Kurakawa, a short and weird girl from the Biology Club who dresses like she's homeless and is trying to make a "perfect human". 

One of the most important, and also most interesting, is Yui Goidou. Yui is a drummer for the wind instruments club, but her repressive and traditional mother makes her withdraw to concentrate on becoming a proper lady. Yui's mother beats Keima whenever he approaches Yui, including initially when he just happens to be in the area and isn't even speaking to Yui. Keima plans to conquer her by sneaking into her house at night and enacting some kind of Romeo and Juliet scenario, but the loose soul's power causes him and Yui to switch bodies. At first they have trouble adjusting, but both soon begin to find certain benefits to their new lives. Keima turns Yui's room into his gaming den, and develops a love for "otome" games, which are like gal games, except that the player is female and pursues several men. Meanwhile, Yui in Keima's body has found Chihiro's band, the 2-B Pencils, consisting of Chihiro herself on vocals and guitar, Ayumi on rhythm guitar (Azu-nyan!), Elsie on bass, and Miyako on keyboard and synthesizer. They've been looking for a drummer, and Yui-Keima is glad to take the position that Keima earlier refused when Elsie offered it. Keima is having trouble thinking of a way to conquer Yui, since he can't seem to fill the emptiness in her heart while in her body. He finally hits upon one of his usual ingenious plans, spurred by his recent addiction to otome games: since Yui is the man now and he is the woman, he should play it like an otome game and let her be the one to do the conquering. Keima-Yui fakes an illness and creates a situation where Yui's mother keeps "her" home from school. Yui-Keima isn't allowed entry since Yui's mother hates Keima, and this causes the emptiness in Yui's heart to grow as she continues believing that she trapped Keima in her body and then made him ill. In the end, Yui-Keima busts into the house and grabs Keima-Yui, making an impassioned speech about "Yui" needing to live her own life and thinking how she should've done this from the start instead of hiding in Keima's body. The loose soul comes free, but is too powerful for Elsie; someone else traps it behind the scenes and leaves it for Elsie. In the end, Keima quits the band, making Chihiro and Ayumi mad at him, but Yui shows up, wearing a boy's uniform and with a more boyish haircut, and volunteers to play for them. They don't want any more boys in the band, but Yui reveals that she's a girl and they accept her.

I loved the cleverness of Yui's story, switching Keima and Yui and then having Keima use otome games to figure out a solution. It was also a lot of fun and rather unique. Yui reappears during the Goddess Hunt arc for a second story that's just as fun as the first. (Keima wears girl's clothes—and Shiori sees him doing it.)

But the most important story for the Goddess Hunt arc turns out to be Tenri's. What I took to be a split personality is actually a goddess, Diana, who lives inside Tenri. Tenri is Keima's childhood friend (although Keima claims that she fails numerous criteria to be a true childhood friend character, such as by living in the house kiddy-corner from his rather than the one next door). For whatever reason, she has a crush on him. When they were children, they stumbled into a hidden cave together and were under attack by spirits. Diana was also sealed in the cave, and made a deal with Tenri to inhabit her in return for giving her the power to rescue the unconscious Keima. Unlike the loose souls, goddesses like Diana thrive on the host's feelings of love and affection, and can switch with the host, taking over the body. Diana has been hiding inside Tenri and disguising herself by pretending to be a loose soul, but she's tracked down by Nora, another devil on the Loose Souls Team, and her buddy Ryou. Nora is the awful sempai that Elsie mentioned when she saw Ayumi being bullied by the third years. Her and Ryou's method is to fill the emptiness in the heart by granting some immediate wish. Nora reads Tenri's wish and sees Keima; when she guesses that Tenri loves Keima, Tenri denies in embarrassment, so Nora decides that Tenri hates him and resolves to kill him. With Diana's help, Keima avoids death and tricks Nora by giving her a weak loose soul that Diana had been keeping. 

Now that I've read the story, I know why Tenri is so popular for doujinshi. She's another adorable shy character like Shiori; she's sort of weird and carries around a piece of bubble wrap, compulsively popping the cells when she's nervous. She likes magic (she's actually pretty good, too, although Keima's impossible to impress. Elsie likes her tricks, though). She's also probably the most abused character. Even though Haqua has a crush on Keima, she's always denying it and hitting him, so I only occasionally feel sorry for her. Every time Tenri appears, my heart goes out to her. She has a crush on Keima, and he knows it; she's never told him herself, but Diana reminds him constantly, since her power depends on the strength of Tenri's love. She even moved into the house next door to him just to be near him, and tries to spend as much time with him as she can. But Keima ignores her, avoids her, takes her for granted, and only associates with her because he needs to speak with Diana. Though I've grown to like Haqua a lot more while reading the manga, she still doesn't make for as nice a pair with Keima as Kanon or Shiori. Tenri easily reaches that level. I'd be perfectly satisfied if the series ended with Keima and Tenri getting together.

But the possibility of Keima getting with Kanon or Shiori reenters the picture when the Goddess Hunt arc begins. Diana tells Keima that she wants to find her sisters, the Jupiter Sisters, five other descendants of the god Jupiter who gave their freedom to seal away the loose souls and bring New Hell into existence. Diana believes they might have done as she did and hidden themselves in former loose soul carriers so their presences would seem to be just loose souls. She asks Keima to help her by investigating all the girls he's conquered in the past. If a girl is a goddess carrier, she will not have lost her memories of the conquest, so Keima must get the girls to talk about this with him. He first scorns the goddess hunt as impossible, then tries a few unsuccessful direct inquiries, asking Chihiro if they ever kissed. He finally decides to hold an event at the cultural festival, along with Diana, bringing in all the girls and having Diana check them.

But things move ahead sooner than Keima had planned when Kanon, back at school for exams, drags him into the hall in the middle of a test to tell him that she remembers the conquest. It turns out that Kanon is a carrier for Apollo, the god(dess?) of music and poetry, who is gaining power from Kanon's love-filled songs. Kanon ends up getting stabbed by Fiore, a demon from a group called Vintage that wants to revive Old Hell. She is found by Keima and Elsie, who call Haqua to help get her to Keima's house. Diana comes over and tries her best to get the dagger out, but can't; she tells Keima that she needs at least one of her sisters to get it out, and that the curse will probably overtake Kanon and Apollo within about a week. Keima, in an uncharacteristic show of emotion, blames himself for not taking the goddess hunt seriously and getting Kanon hurt with his carelessness. He sends Elsie to disguise herself as Kanon, since she knows all of Kanon's songs and dance moves, and make sure no one knows Kanon is missing. He tells Diana to lay low in case Vintage is around; near where Kanon was found, Keima also found a device like the loose soul detectors, except that it responds to goddesses. Keima then asks Haqua to be his partner for the week while he undertakes his first ever conquest of five real girls at once.

Haqua disguises herself as Elsie and helps Keima as he attempts to find the goddesses. Earlier, during Yui's story, he met Mio while in Yui's body. Since Mio and Yui are friends (they're both rich, after all), Mio spoke to him and told him that she remembers the conquest as happening between her and Morita, her driver. This disqualifies her as a goddess candidate. Kusunoki was also disqualified during Hinoki's arc, as she thinks that the final date scene happened between her and all the men in her dojo. Keima has a theory that since goddesses thrive on love, and he is the only buddy who captures loose souls with love, the goddesses are all in girls that are near him. Mio and Kusunoki, being in different classes and (in Kusunoki's case) different years, are too distant. He confirms this (somewhat) by eliminating Nagase (who remembers him, but doesn't remember that he was at the wrestling match with her) and Minami (who doesn't remember him at all). He goes to look for Akari, but she and her whole traveling circus have disappeared (we were shown offscreen that Akari is actually a devil; she was pretending to have a loose soul in hopes of revealing Fiore. Nikaido seems to be her buddy. This is a plot point that still hasn't developed fully). The other girls all live far away or in the town, or go to different schools. This leaves him with five candidates: Ayumi, Chihiro, Shiori, Yui, and Tsukiyo. Since everyone now thinks that he and Kanon are going out (because of what happened during the exam), Keima reasons that he must find the girls who are mad at him; these girls are mad because they remember the conquest and are in love with him.

Ayumi and Chihiro are always mad at him, so it's hard to tell, but Tsukiyo and Shiori both give responses that suggest they remember. (Wakaki apologizes in the margins for making us wait so long for Shiori's reappearance—you should apologize! We got to see Kanon again several chapters ago, but we haven't seen Shiori since the end of her story!) Yui comes and introduces herself like she doesn't know him, but says she loves him and starts trying to romance him like he's a girl and she's a boy (one of those pushy boys from shoujo manga, at that). Shiori happens to see them and thinks Yui is a boy. She also later sees Keima crossdressing as part of his plot to reveal the goddess in Yui (if there is one). But the first to crack is Tsukiyo, who is the carrier for the god(dess?) Vulcan, the eldest of the Jupiter Sisters. Vulcan and Diana manage to dispel the curse over Kanon and Apollo, but Apollo has withdrawn both of them deep within Kanon's mind to protect them, and they can't be awoken. Apollo herself is the healing expert, but Diana and Vulcan tell Keima that Mercury might be able to help, if he can find her. After this comes Yui's reconquest, which was very fun and creative, just like the first one. Since Yui approaches it like a player character, Keima can't win with his usual tactics, and he decides to take the role of a heroine. He wears a girl's uniform and a wig and goes to an amusement park with Yui on a date, where he gets Haqua to pose as a Vintage member and attack him, drawing out Mars, the goddess inside Yui.

At this point, seeing the pattern, I predicted that since the remaining goddesses were Minerva and Mercury, the remaining carriers were Shiori and Ayumi. Minerva is goddess of wisdom, so she would gravitate towards book-loving Shiori, who already seemed to remember the conquest. Mercury is the messenger of the gods, the swift, the fleet-footed, so it would make sense for her to be inside track team member Ayumi. I was right about Shiori and Minerva, but we haven't seen who has Mercury yet. Wakaki cleverly led us to believe it was Ayumi, then made Chihiro look plausible as well.

Haqua leaves to go to a meeting of section chiefs after an incident where Keima tricks Fiore, a new member of the squad, into exposing herself as a member of Vintage in front of Nora and Haqua. He traps Fiore in a loose soul bottle. Fiore manages to trick Haqua into letting her out, using their former school relationship (she was second in the class after Haqua), and traps Haqua, Nora, and Keima, once he comes home. However, Keima turns the tables, getting information from Fiore and then revealing that Vulcan was waiting outside the whole time. Vulcan easily defeats Fiore and traps her again. Haqua makes the mistake of telling Chief Dokuro about Vintage, getting herself taken into custody and interrogated as a traitor to Hell. Meanwhile, Keima helps Shiori finish her story for the cultural festival (Shiori is adorable as always) and then falls ill. He is almost discovered by Vintage when they contact Fiore's goddess sensor for a report and don't get one, but Nora's idiot partner Ryou comes in and issues the signal to check in on Nora's orders. Keima can't move because of his cold, but he impresses Ryou into service and uses the opportunity to get Ayumi and Chihiro to come visit him on his sickbed. Ayumi comes first and tends to him in bed, but Chihiro unexpectedly arrives after Keima's plan to keep her away fails. Keima forces Ayumi to hide in his bed while he speaks with Chihiro, who also tends to him and ends up playing him a song that she played part of during an earlier story, when Keima told her he liked it. Keima again tells her that he likes it, and Chihiro leaves, satisfied. She comes back, however, and tells him through the door that she likes him. Keima pretends like he couldn't hear her and Chihiro says it was nothing and runs off. Ayumi, though, was in the room with Keima; she calls Chihiro afterward, preempting Keima's attempt to call Chihiro and tell her that he did hear. Ayumi tells Chihiro that her love is genuine when Chihiro suggests otherwise, and says she'll be rooting for them.

Bringing us in to Chapter 160, Haqua has been freed from the torture chamber by Chief Dokuro (who is secretly female somehow) and the four found goddesses have gathered to try and revive Apollo, but have failed, since Apollo is using her oracle powers to try and bring some good luck to the city of Maijima for the final battle.

I love the Goddess Hunt arc. Not only do we see more of girls I liked the first time, like Yui and Shiori, we also get a very tight and well-paced plot unlike anything I ever expected from Kami Nomi. I left out most of the details from Keima's reconquests of Shiori and Yui, but they're just as much fun as the original conquests, and now we get stories with more than one girl that couldn't have happened before, like the sickbed story with Ayumi and Chihiro. Keima's abilities are really being pushed by his attempt to conquer five girls at once, but he's once again proving that he's smarter than Lelouch and deserves his title "God of Conquest". I loved how he outmaneuvers and manipulates people like Nora and Fiore that could kill him; it may not have quite the suspense of L fighting the supernatural to get Kira, but it's at an even greater level of audacity. 

Wakaki's art is also getting steadily more impressive. The cityscape inside Apollo's mind was really well drawn. I just flipped back through the conclusion of Shiori's reconquest, when she follows Keima's advice and writes a story about herself, and noticed that some of the panels are drawn to look like stacks of books and books sitting on a shelf. The same kind of cleverness that we see in stories like Yui's is also evident in the art. I love it so much that I'd pay for a US release just for a decent translation and a nice print quality (the new translators aren't as bad as the early ones, but the pages are full of annoying and usually pointless translators notes, and the quality of the scan is pretty horrid). 

** Thoughts on the conclusion of the Goddess Hunt arc and other random things, Saturday, September 29th, 2012:

I've thought about it, and I've decided that while Ai no Yokan isn't a bad song at all, I would've been happier with new animation featuring Kusunoki, Chihiro, Nagase, and Haqua and Kusunoki, Chihiro, Nagase, and Haqua versions of Koi no Shirushi. Ami Koshimizu, Kana Asumi, Aki Toyosaki, and Saori Hayami can all sing (they've done so for other shows), so it would have been fine. They could have used Ai no Yokan as an insert song or something. (I liked Koi no Shirushi before I even watched the show. My favorite version was always Kanon's, although all the versions have something to recommend them. I just downloaded the full Ayumi version; the arrangement is different from what was in the anime, and Ayana Taketatsu's voice is cute as always. This is a taste of what we'd get if they ever made an anime of the weird restarted K-On manga where Azusa is the lead singer of her band.)

I reread the Tenri story, and everything became more clear. When Tenri and Keima were seven years old, they were on a class trip to the beach. Keima was playing games as always (he has what looks like a Neo-Geo Pocket) and Tenri was hiding somewhere. They both end up on a boat in the harbor, which gets shaken loose and floats out to sea after an earthquake. They're stranded on an island and start to look around, finding a cave and deciding to go inside, since Keima thinks it might lead back to land. Inside the cave, Keima keeps his cool, lights their way with his eight Neo-Geo Pockets (good thing he didn't have one of the old Game Boys; those things weren't backlit), and gives Tenri his lunch when she gets hungry. Tenri starts to develop a crush on him because she admires how collected he is. Somewhere deep in the cave, another earthquake knocks a rock on Keima's head and renders him unconscious; the pair is then attacked by loose souls. Diana makes a pact with Tenri to help them in return for habitation rights, and gets them out through the other end of the cave, which is a hole under the floor of the theater building at Maijima High School (the same one where Haqua and Elsie fought the loose soul during Haqua's story). Keima woke up with a bandage on his head and didn't remember anything, which is why he didn't remember Tenri at first (they had never really spoken before this). His house, the one diagonally across from Tenri's, was destroyed, so he and his family moved into their current house, which used to belong to Keima's grandfather (who appears during Airi's story and seems to dote on Keima, although Keima is pained by his attempts to understand gal games). 

Anyway, the conclusion of the Goddess Hunt story was really good. After Chihiro confesses her love to Keima, Ayumi starts trying to cheer them on. Keima decides that since he has this plot going, he'll just try to get closer to Chihiro and find out whether she has a goddess in her. They end up going on a "date" on the first night of the school festival; Keima gets Chihiro alone and tries to kiss her, but stops when Chihiro says it's her first kiss, revealing that she doesn't remember the kiss with him and doesn't have a goddess. Keima is confused, and Chihiro admits that she started to like him even before the conquest (she still remembers parts of it, but not their kiss or the final scene on the boat, apparently). Keima, knowing that he now needs to switch to Ayumi, tells Chihiro that he only invited her on a date so he could get back at her for making fun of him all the time, and that he would never date a real girl. Ayumi, who came up to the roof where they are to spy on them, hears this and, as one might expect, gets angry at Keima for toying with her friend.

Surprisingly, Keima is very bothered by this incident. After he goes home, he soaks in the bath in the dark until Diana comes over and tries to make him love Tenri so she can get her wings back (the other goddesses all have wings because of what happened during the girls' reconquests). Keima gets angry and yells at both Diana and Tenri, saying they have no idea what he's feeling, and tells them to get out. He comes out later to find Tenri sitting at the entrance and goes to talk to her; Tenri tries to cheer him up by using a joke ear. They talk as Tenri continues her show; she gets in the magic box and has Keima chain it shut, then finally tells him that she loves him from inside, after which she reappears next to the box. (Tenri's pretty good at magic, and she must be happy to finally be getting something like appreciation from Keima. The first time she showed him a trick, he just asked if she still had no friends and if that meant that no one else had seen her tricks.) Keima's character development over the Goddess Hunt arc has been surprising; he actually steps up and becomes a hyper-genius on the life or death scale, but he also starts to show more and more that he does have some kind of feelings towards the girls that he's conquering. Hearing that Chihiro, who always seemed to hate him, actually liked him even before he conquered her, and still likes him when she can't even remember the conquest, seems to have had a deep effect on him. After all, that means that her feelings towards him were based on his constant game playing, some fights, and whatever she can remember of the conquest, which, without the final scene, was still mostly Keima berating her for being too half-assed. Later in this story, Keima even admits (to the audience) that he didn't mean anything he said to Chihiro on the rooftop. 

Keima switches his attention to Ayumi, who is now angry at him. He tries various ways to get close to her while avoiding Chihiro, but none succeed on either count. (At one point, lamenting Ayumi's speed, he comments that her mobility is unbelievable, and the panel underneath shows a Fire Emblem battle map with Ayumi standing on the grass with a huge move radius, while Keima is stuck in the trees and can only move one space at a time.) In between, he hears something from Elsie (who's doing a presentation, disguised as Kanon, about the history of the school's festival) and decides to look into the history of the school. He goes to the library and asks Shiori for information about the school's history, eventually discovering that the old theater building existed before the school did. Keima goes to the theater building and finds the hole that he and Tenri used (to escape out of the cave as children, and to get into it and away from Nora during Tenri's story) has been sealed. He has Elsie fly him out to the rock where the other end of the cave is; they find a hidden entrance to a huge facility filled with Level 4 loose souls ready to be unleashed on the world. Vintage is trying to set up Old Hell on earth, in Maijima. Keima determines to continue his conquest of Ayumi (who we've been shown at this point contains the god(dess?) Mercury). Akari, also known as Rimyuel, and Nikaido are also lurking around and were the ones who opened the barrier to let Keima and Elsie get into the facility.

That night, Ayumi and Chihiro go into a clearing in the forest to talk. Ayumi tells Chihiro that she's quitting the band because she wasn't cheering for Chihiro in her love for Keima. Keima, seeing the ending slipping away, interferes, but as he's trying to make things work, he receives a signal on his paper wristband. All the girls with goddesses have one, and tearing it will send a signal to Keima so he knows if they're in danger. Keima, Ayumi, and Chihiro also come under attack by Vintage forces, but are rescued by Haqua, who suddenly became awesome somehow. Lune, one of the leaders of Vintage, is capturing every girl that Keima ever conquered, knowing that some of them have goddesses since she hacked Haqua's raiment, which keeps a record of Haqua's activities. Ayumi leaves, but Nora appears and Keima sends her to watch over Ayumi, and brings Chihiro with him to his house so Haqua can keep her safe. Diana comes over and she, Keima, and Haqua discuss the situation upstairs; Chihiro happens to come up to tell Keima she's leaving and ends up hearing the discussion. She doesn't completely understand, but she hears that humanity is in danger if they don't succeed. Diana and Haqua both want to go attack the facility that Keima and Elsie found, but Keima tells them it's a suicide mission and that the only way to save the world is to complete the conquest of Ayumi. He resolves to complete it that very night.

Keima begins a desperate campaign to make Ayumi fall in love with him, while chased by Vintage members and followed at a distance by Haqua and Chihiro. Chihiro is still hurt by what Keima said to her, but she decides to help, knowing how bad things are. She ends up telling Ayumi while they're alone (by chance) that Keima is trying to "conquer" her using games, but Keima catches on that she's actually helping him, using her knowledge of Ayumi's personality; Ayumi knows something is up because of the forcefulness of Keima's attempts to get close to her, and Chihiro knows that dishonesty will make her more angry than the truth. Chihiro also tells her that Keima seems to be doing it for a good reason, and they both agree that he doesn't seem like the type to do it just to mess with her. Ayumi still runs him through the ringer, forcing him into an escalating battle of romantic gestures—first making him promise to marry her, then forcing him to meet her parents, then forcing him to say "I love you" like he means it, then making him admit that he doesn't love her (though he still turns it around and makes it sound favorable), and finally putting him through a "wedding" on the ship where Chihiro's final scene took place, with lighting and effects by Nora. (She doesn't want to say vows because she doesn't trust his words anymore, knowing now that they all come from games.) With this, Mercury regains her power. A bit earlier, Diana also appeared, now with wings, to help fight the Vintage members. She and Mercury, along with Akari and the non-Vintage members of the Loose Souls Squad, who show up just in the nick of time, go free the other girls, and together, the six goddesses destroy the Vintage facility and save Maijima from becoming New Old Hell. (We get to see Akari without her hat again. She's pretty cute when she takes off that hobo beanie.)

In a postscript to the Goddess story, the six goddesses get together for the first time and have a sleepover, where they spend lots of time arguing over whose host gets Keima. Diana tells them that his plan was to reveal that he was six-timing, which he believed would make the girls so angry that they would all give up on him. Apollo doesn't think it will make a difference to them. When Mercury wakes up and mentions that Ayumi is "married" to Keima, Apollo says it's possible to have more than one wife and the others argue that the marriage was fake. Haqua and Nora also discuss how Chief Dokuro was framed for the crime of being Vintage's leader and killed during the arrest.

The conclusion pretty much summed up everything I said I loved before about the Goddess Hunt arc, but I also liked how low-key the final fight scene was. It's pretty much just a few panels showing the goddesses combing their power and blowing up the rock, with voiceover by Elsie. I like that Wakaki resisted the urge to make some extra chapter showing the battle and try to throw in more suspense (that would be utterly not suspenseful at this point) over whether the goddesses' power would be enough to win. That's always been a vice of fighting manga; for example, we all knew once Goku became a Super Saiyan that Freeza was defeated, yet the anime still dragged the fight on for five more episodes. The plot structure of the Goddess Hunt arc was sort of like a fighting manga—like Rurouni Kenshin's Kyoto arc or Yu Yu Hakusho's Dark Tournament, it was a long, exciting story where new characters appear and characters from the earlier, more episodic stories reappear to do new things, and where the main character's skills are forced to reach new levels. Yet even the mostly unimpeachable Rurouni Kenshin still made the mistake of dragging the Shishio fight on for an episode after it was clear that Kenshin had won, and the Toguro battle in Yu Yu Hakusho was just too long in general. Kami Nomi did not make this mistake, even though we saw in Haqua's fight with the Vintage member that Wakaki can write and draw a fight scene pretty well.

A new story, the "Jupiter Saga", has now begun, but I don't have enough chapters to really say anything about it. So far Keima keeps slipping into alternate realities (including one where he's in a 16-bit RPG, which he tries to get back to after leaving it), so he hasn't had to confront any of the goddess carriers yet about their relationship. It's unclear whether there are still loose souls free; Diana had said earlier that the goddesses could seal them all if they were together, but Elsie was talking like there were still some around. Haqua is reappointed to the Loose Souls Team, and Nora gets all the credit and gets promoted. (I don't like Nora. She's a pain, and also this is a series about adorable pettanko, so having someone with breasts is just wrong. Well, Elsie has breasts, but her cuteness supersedes any complaints about that.)

** Character Ranking
Well, without preamble, here's a Kami Nomi character ranking, with commentary to be filled in later. Since Kami Nomi has so many characters, it's one of those cases where being anywhere in the top six or so is really high caliber. Even top ten still means I like the character a lot in this case.

*** 1. Elsea de Lux Irma

Elsie!! She's indescribably adorable. Elsie just bats at the edge of elite class when it comes to adorableness (elite class contains such paragons of adorableness as Azu-nyan and Fuko Ibuki). For some reason she's obsessed with fire engines, and she can't seem to catch a break; Keima always looks down on her, the other devils belittle her, and she missed her awards ceremony and her chance to show up Nora because she was bothered by a little dirt at the entrance. She also got a pay cut because of how pathetic it is when she gets bossed around by Keima. It's too cute when she obsesses over fire engines and Kanon, and her hero worship of Keima is adorable. They even went on a date to cheer Elsie up at one point, although Keima did his best to make it unromantic. (He asked Chihiro and Ayumi for advice).

*** 2. Shiori Shiomiya

Bakaaaaaaa....! Shiori is probably the most genuinely awkward librarian character I've ever seen in an anime (yet still adorable). When she reappears during the goddess hunt arc, she can talk, but she does so in a strange robotic manner that weirds out everyone, and often says odd things because she can't get her words about her. (Similar to when she tried to thank Keima and said "Arigaron".) I also love it when a character is a writer, since I once wished to be one. Her hair ribbons and her long, frilly sleeves are really adorable too.

*** 3. Kanon Nakagawa

I normally don't like idol characters, but Kanon is no normal idol character. Her relationship with Keima, depending on him to talk about her problems, is ridiculously moe moe. Far from being arrogant or fame-hungry, Kanon is actually humble, down-to-earth, and hardworking. (She had a complex about being forgotten, which is a little strange given how cute she is, but that's not quite like being fame-hungry.) Her cat-shaped stun guns in the anime were hilarious. She also manages to pull off a little-seen maneuver by looking just as good without glasses as with them; most characters look better with glasses. When Kanon appeared as the first goddess carrier and revealed that she remembered the conquest, I was really happy. I also liked seeing her again when Keima helped her (and Ayumi and Chihiro) study for exams so they could get a 100. As a sign of the depth of her feelings for Keima, she blushes whenever she looks at him and finds herself unconsciously staring. (She acts like she doesn't remember him, which she doesn't later on when Apollo is inside her, so it's hard to say whether she didn't remember him or was just pretending not to because she was embarrassed.) Looking back on the Goddess Hunt arc, just after Kanon gets stabbed by Fiore, Keima thinks that she was trying to tell him that she remembered during the study session. Kanon also thinks at one point that she was trying to tell him, when she first reappears and is revealed to carry Apollo insid e her. 

*** 4. Tenri Ayukawa

Poor Tenri never gets a break either, and unlike Elsie, she isn't cheerful enough to stay above the depression. Tenri is forgotten, ignored, avoided, and pushed away by the one she loves, Keima. The only reason she spends as much time with him as she does is that Diana forces her to. She's awkward and strange, has no friends (and apparently hasn't ever had any), and plays with bubble wrap. She even gets yelled at by Nanaka for spacing out all the time, which leads Diana to crush Nanaka in a game of shogi as vengeance. (Tenri is so moe moe that even Diana wants to protect her.) But she's very sweet, and she's actually pretty good at magic; she finally gets a moment with Keima when she cheers him up after he says terrible things to Chihiro and regrets it. I guess I could live if the series ended with Keima and Haqua getting together, but I'd really like to see him get together with Kanon, Shiori, or Tenri. I heard that Tenri gets to appear in the Kami Nomi OVA; I hope we can get that over here pretty soon.

*** 5. Yui Goidou

Yui's original formulation as an ojou-sama from a rich traditional family was cute enough, but I really liked how unexpected it was when she started to adjust to her life as a man while in Keima's body. Then she turned around and became like Utena, wearing a boy's uniform and acting boyish--although she doesn't do yuri like Utena; instead, she tries to make Keima into a girl, which Keima lets himself succumb to during Yui's reconquest by crossdressing. I thought the crossdressing adventures were hilarious (especially when Shiori sees Keima and decides he's a perverted, worthless crossdresser, which causes her considerable anguish) and I also thought it was funny when Yui and Keima had switched bodies and Yui kept acting according to her mental image of Keima, earning her abuse and anger from people like Ayumi, Chihiro, and Nikaido who think that Keima is mocking them again.

*** 6. Keima Katsuragi

The series wouldn't work without Keima as the main character. Well, it could have potentially worked with someone like Tomoya Okazaki, who's just a natural at getting girls to like him, but it would've been a totally different series and the world would have missed out on something really good. Keima is much deeper than the usual otaku main character, with an actual worldview based entirely on a desire to abdicate the real world. His weird presentations of theories of the world based on games, following the words "Ii koto oshiete yarou" directed at Elsie, are always fun and clever. He even comes up with weird acronyms to remember the rules--"BMW" for little sister characters (standing for "Blood", "Memories", and "Woniichan moe") and "Toyota" for childhood friends (standing for "The house next door", "oniichan" or "otouto", "yakusoku", "old memories", and "tachiba", i.e. position or standing). According to him, Elsie fails on BMW (although he eventually acknowledges that she succeeds on M and W) and Tenri fails on "Toyota" since she lived diagonally across from him, they certainly didn't have a close relationship, there are no promises between them, and their positions haven't changed at all; Keima is still the game-playing weirdo, and Tenri is still the girl with no friends who doesn't talk. As I said originally, Keima makes this series what it is, and I like watching him apply his hyper-genius abilities to games and game-style conquests in real life.

*** 7. Ayumi Takahara

Ayumi was just okay in her first appearance, but I remember thinking when she reappeared in the second series, "Was she always that cute?" Plus, I didn't understand about Ayana Taketatsu back then. (It was before Azu-nyan, and when I still didn't like Kirino.) She had several adorable moments in the manga, including her "wedding" to Keima and the gauntlet she makes him run to get there, but one of my favorite Ayumi scenes is during the chapter when the members of Chihiro's band are all studying to get 100s on their English exams so Kodama will let them establish a light music club and they'll have somewhere to practice. (The whole chapter is littered with references to K-On, even though Wakaki writes in the margins at the beginning that the girl band thing has nothing to do with a recently popular series.) Keima had allotted one hour to help the girls study: 30 minutes for Ayumi, 30 minutes for Chihiro, and nothing for Elsie. Then Kanon shows up wanting to study too, so Keima cuts it to 20 minutes between the three girls. During Ayumi's time slot, Ayumi insists that she's not an idiot and she could score well if she tried (her most recent score was a 35, which is two points above failure). She tells Keima that she even got a 100 in middle school and has her mother send a picture of the test to her phone, only to discover it was actually in elementary school. Later, when Kodama lets them form a club due to glee that Keima got a 99 on his own exam, Kodama pulls the four band members into a group hug, with Ayumi and Elsie on the ends. In the next panel Ayumi is saying "He touched me" with a look of utter disgust. She was also really cute when she came to visit Keima on his sickbed and he forced her to hide in his bed from Chihiro.

*** 8. Chihiro Kousaka

Like Ayumi, Chihiro wouldn't have made my top ten based on the anime alone (although her story was pretty good), but things that happened during the Goddess Hunt made me promote her. Chihiro doesn't suffer the constant disappointment and abuse of Tenri or Elsie, but she does take several crushing blows, most notably when Keima says that he dated her to get revenge so he can switch to Ayumi during the goddess hunt. She also gets rejected constantly when confessing her love, and then somehow falls in love with Keima. Of all the girls we've seen again, Chihiro probably changes the most from her initial appearance; she goes from being lazy and into nothing but good-looking men to being passionate about her band and able to admit to herself that she likes Keima. Chihiro is also designed really well; she looks enough like a background character that I wouldn't have guessed she'd get her own story, and you can see why people would look past her when she's with Ayumi, but she can still be pretty cute, especially on her date with Keima when she wears the flowers in her hair. She's actually pretty smart, helping Keima to conquer Ayumi, and is flexible enough to adapt to the situation when she discovers the importance of Keima conquering Ayumi. I'm sorry to say I forgot who she was when she reappeared in the second series, but I won't forget again. Besides, her sharp, beady eyes will make her stand out.

*** 9. Haqua du lot Herminium

Like Chihiro and Ayumi, I wasn't that into Haqua when she first appeared. For one thing, Wakaki intentionally made her hard to like when she first showed up so that it wouldn't seem cruel to knock her down the way he does. But she was pretty cute when she clung to Keima in a pathetic manner, and even more so in Episode 8 when she shows up asking for help with her report. I liked when she brightly and cheerfully insisted that Keima was happy to see her, making him accuse her of talking like a 90s gal game. Many of Haqua's best moments were in the story where Yukie first appears. In fact, she's probably the most abused character in the series (just above Tenri); first she gets assigned to a buddy whose tactic is frustratingly slow, gets beaten by Elsie in captures, then falls in love with Keima (always a horrible proposition, given how little he cares about others' feelings), and then gets taken captive and tortured by the police in Hell. Then she has to become awesome somehow and come back and fight the Vintage members. After all that, she loses all credit for her sacrifices to Nora. For all her grouchiness, Haqua does have a nice side; she's gracious enough to acknowledge that Elsie's done a good job in beating her, and when Yukie falls down chasing her, she turns to go back and help pick up the Gokult. 

*** 10. Tsukiyo Kujou

I usually like goth-loli tsundere (like Negima's Evangeline and Gosick's Victorica), but Tsukiyo wasn't quite at the top level. She was still rather cute, though. Her story had some quite funny moments involving her dependence on Keima when she's shrunk to the size of a doll. Also, it was just generally adorable seeing Keima carrying Tsukiyo in doll clothes everywhere.

[March 10th, 2014: Tsukiyo in the anime is totally adorable. She's voiced by Yuka Iguchi. Tsukihi-chan!!! Something about that woman's voice is so idiotically adorable, especially the way she says her k's. I just think about the way Tsukihi-chan says "Nadeko-chan" and get a thrill from the adorableness. Tsukiyo's place among the goddess carriers is quite secured by the way she's shown in the anime. If all the characters above her weren't so good, I'd raise her rank.]

*** 11. Mari Katsuragi

This is mostly based on Mari's bonus chapter where she thinks that Keima and her husband have forgotten her birthday. Mari outwardly pretends like she isn't worried about what will become of Keima, but she secretly fears that he will end up marrying a cardboard cutout of a game character and living under a bridge inside a pipe, claiming to be God. She also wishes he would be more like a normal son and wants to have a good relationship with him, but can't remember a time when he wasn't obsessed with games. 

*** 12. Minami Ikoma

Minami is the closest the series comes to having a loli (I guess Tsukiyo is sort of a loli, although not a really acute one). An earnest girl who loves swimming, she happens to see Keima swimming in the pool after hours one night and becomes entranced. Her friends (who make fun of her all the time) tell her about Keima's reputation as a weirdo, and just as Keima planned, the combination of her first impression of him, the stories she hears, and the fact that he's a sempai combine to give her a larger-than-life image of him, which Keima uses to fill the emptiness in her heart.

*** 13. Jun Nagase

When I first watched the anime, I really liked Nagase. She's definitely cute, she just got superseded by characters who appeared again. (Though we got to see her when Keima verified that she didn't have a goddess in her.) Her obsession with pro wrestling was funny, and she's a good person; she seemed genuinely happy for Keima when he lied that he'd quit games and had a girlfriend (with Haqua pretending to be his girlfriend).

*** 14. Mio Aoyama

It seems the Goddess Hunt arc was so good, it lifted everyone who appeared in it to a higher rank and left everyone else around the bottom. Actually, even when I had only seen the first series, Mio was my least favorite character; she's just sort of hard to like, given her haughty attitude and pretensions to richness. But of all the girls Keima conquers, she probably takes the biggest turn for the positive of anyone (with Chihiro in second). When we see her again during Yui's story, she's working part-time at a  bread shop to help her mother make ends meet. It's also interesting to see her talking to Yui (actually Keima in Yui's body), who's also from the upper class and hence is spared Mio's scorn for the "commoners". 

*** 15. Kusunoki Kasuga

Kusunoki is very beautiful and a great fighter, but she doesn't have the same kind of great moments as the girls higher in the rankings. We do see during Hinoki's story that she decided to throw a sop to her feminine side by taking in the cat with the big pink ribbon on it that used to hang around the school.

*** 16. Akari Kurakawa

Akari's story was sort of strange and hard to follow, but it did contain a very interesting and weirdly deep scene where Keima and Akari discuss what a "perfect human" would be. Of course, it turns out that she's a demon named Rimyuel who works with Nikaido, and that she set up the whole thing to lure in Vintage. I hope that we're going to find out more about her, because she wasn't really explained during the Goddess Hunt arc. She normally dresses like she's homeless in a dirty coat and mittens, but when she takes off that Alaska fisherman beanie, she has long black hair tied into twin tails and is really cute.

*** 17. Sumire Uemoto

She's definitely cute, but her obsession with ramen is sort of strange, and there isn't a lot to her character. Her arc was sort of a nice filler arc to pad out the story before beginning the goddess hunt.

*** 18. Nanaka Haibara

Nanaka's story is more about Diana than anyone. I think I could have liked Nanaka if we'd seen more of her, but we really didn't see much of her personality (although we did see more personality than we did with Sumire). Plus, she was mean to Tenri and yelled at her. How could anyone yell at Tenri? I'd expect most people to feel moe for Tenri and buy her an industrial-size roll of bubble wrap. She actually deserved to lose to Diana. But like Sumire, her story was entertaining and made for some good filler, and we also got to see more of Tenri and Diana.

*** 19. Rieko Hinaga

In the end credits of the second series, Airi and her grandmother Rieko are shown. Airi is asleep, so you can't see her weird, Tim Burton-esque eyes, and you don't hear her song about cutting people's heads off. Rieko is actually the one with the loose soul; an apparition of her younger self appears in the graveyard. Like Sumire and Nanaka, but even more acutely, we don't see much of Rieko's personality. Still, her story is sort of poignant, and I liked seeing Keima's grandfather, and some of the weird things Airi does were funny.

*** 20. Hinoki Kasuga

Unlike Rieko, Nanaka, and Sumire, we do see Hinoki's personality, and I don't like it. Hinoki is another example of why Kami Nomi girls need to be pettanko (or at best average-sized); whenever there's a "mature, sexy" character, she's really hard to like. Hinoki was just a pain, and her story really dragged. Her sisterly relationship with Kusunoki was not nearly as cute as it could've been. Her personality was too pushy and obnoxious—and not pushy like Yui, in a fun way. Just pushy in an annoying way. Also, her megaphone annoyed me for some reason.

*** 21. Yukie Marui

Well, what do you expect, this weird middle-aged woman isn't going to score high when the one doing the scoring is a moe freak like me. She is funny, though, and she makes Haqua suffer, which is where Haqua's moe comes from. Overall, I really liked the story where she appeared. It's just the character herself who can't rank high among this competition. I guess I could've put her above Hinoki, though (come to think of it, I do like her better than Hinoki).

*** 22. Ryou

His idiocy is rather amusing, but I'm glad he didn't appear too often, because he is dumb as a rock and it would've gotten old. Plus, he's Nora's partner, and I really don't like Nora.

*** 23. Nora Florian Leona

What can I say, I hate Nora. It's probably no coincidence that she was mean to Elsie (look who's number one on this list). Her personality is like Hinoki, but even more obnoxious, and devoid of redeeming qualities. I enjoyed seeing her totally outwitted and manipulated on numerous occasions by Keima. If Nora died at some point, I'd be okay with that.

Not ranked:
Dokurou (the girl, due to not having finished her arc) and Dokurou (the chief, due to I don't really have an opinion on her one way or the other).
Keima's grandfather.
Tenri's mother.
Nikaido and Kodama.

** Thoughts on the first episode of the Kami Nomi: Goddesses anime, <2014-01-14 Tue>

I've been avoiding this show for a while because I had read the manga, which makes me feel bad since I read the manga illegally. But Monogatari is almost over and I wasn't really that into Sunday Without God (which totally stole Kami Nomi's logo, by the way) or GJ-bu or Inu x Boku SS or any of the other shows I tried watching. So I decided to check this out.

We didn't get the OVAs that cover the Yui and Tsukiyo and Tenri arcs in English, unfortunately; Goddesses does a five-second overview of them at the beginning of Episode 1. Too bad, because those were some of the best arcs of the manga (Tenri was set up as important from the beginning, but I think Yui and Tsukiyo became popular enough to be goddesses just based on how good their arcs were; it could have just as well been Sumire and Nanaka! No, probably not.) I do think the animators were very wise to abandon their previous policy of sticking super close to the manga and skip straight to the Goddesses arc, catching some of the highlights in between (I think there was also an OVA that covered the study episode where Kanon remembers Keima but can't say so). The Goddesses arc was incredible; when I first heard how long the manga was, I couldn't imagine how Wakaki could step it up so things wouldn't get boring in this scenario, but the Goddesses arc came along and showed me how small my imagination is.

The first episode pretty much covers Kanon's discovery that she houses a goddess, Vintage's attempts to kill her, and finally her freak-out in class that leads her to confess that she loves Keima, which makes Apollo take over and march her off, right into Lune's trap. We also get to see Tenri and Diana at the beginning. The animators did a good job animating Tenri and bringing her cuteness into living color, and also changing Diana's posture and movements to convey more confidence. She's voiced by Kaori Nazuka, who also played Nunnally Lamperouge in Code Geass and Kyojuu in GA. Apollo and Diana are voiced by the same actresses as Kanon and Tenri, but, especially in Tenri and Diana's case, the voices sound very different. 

Yui is voiced by Ayahi Takagaki, who's apparently never been in anything I've seen or heard of. From the short clips they showed at the beginning it seemed like she did a good job; her voice sounds feminine for the feminine Yui, but becomes more broad and deep when Yui becomes an Utena. Tsukiyo is voiced by Yuka Iguchi (Tsukihi-chan!!!) and has a really cute voice. Tsukiyo is slightly tsundere, which Yuka Iguchi can more than pull off, using her hysterical Tsukihi-chan and her gentle Tsukihi-chan. I also thought the transition to color and movement did a lot for Tsukiyo's appearance; she was cute in the manga, but the anime version combines the dollish delicacy of the manga Tsukiyo with a vibrancy that makes her seem more lifelike.

The recollection sequence also briefly goes through some of the other notable stories, like Akari (Rimyuel, recently revealed in the manga to be the older sister that Elsie talked about, although they aren't blood relatives). 

The series seems pretty lackadaisical about keeping the goddess-carriers' identities secret; all six of them appear in the opening (which I wasn't that fond of, the single sort of bad spot), and they together sing the ending, "Kizuna no Yukue" (which I like a lot, so that makes up for the opening). They threw Chihiro into the opening to at least keep a modicum of suspense, though. Personally, I think Chihiro's story in the Goddesses arc is much better than Ayumi's. I'm not a huge Ayumi fan to begin with, though. The thing I like best about her is Ayana Taketatsu, and I tend to forget that. (I like her, but it's more of an "Oh, yeah, Ayumi? I like her." than a "Kami Nomi? I like Ayumi!" kind of thing.) I'm not sure why I put Ayumi higher than Chihiro in my ranking; I'd reverse those two now. 

I had forgotten (or wasn't thinking that much about) how good this series is. Kami Nomi is kind of like the opposite of Ore Imo; where Ore Imo kept on raising my hopes and then dashing them, Kami Nomi keeps on slipping into obscurity and then reminding me why I liked it. Not only was the Goddesses arc a great story, it was full of cuteness. 

** The Time Travel Arc of the Manga, finally done. <2014-04-13 Sun>
Way back in 2012, I started talking about the beginning of the Time Travel Arc (which has some other name—the Jupiter Sisters Arc, I think, but that name doesn't really fit it). Now it's finally over, with Chapter 266, and apparently the manga itself is almost over too, with just Chapter 268 left to go. 

A lot has happened in this arc. It begins with the goddesses sending Keima back in time for some mysterious purpose. He doesn't bodily travel back, though; instead, his mind is switched with the mind of his seven-year-old self in that period. Keima has to accomplish some unknown goal, aided by Elsie (who does travel bodily back in time with him) and an orb that changes its symbols and sends out beams of light to show him where to go next. It also allows him to "reset" by sending him back to previous points whenever he does something that irreversibly damages the timeline. 

This arc basically has two parts to it: the Urara Part and the School Ranking Part. There's also some introductory and concluding material at each end. In the Urara Part, Keima discovers that some building which he doesn't remember from his own timeline is taking place at the cove where his class is supposed to go on a field trip. That field trip was when he and Tenri fell into the cave, releasing the Weiss and causing Tenri and Diana to join up. Keima has to make sure the trip goes ahead as scheduled, while also taking care of a mysterious girl called Dokuro who looks like a normal middle school girl, despite her lack of common knowledge and sharing a name with the skull-faced commander of the Loose Souls Squad. 

Keima finds out that a girl in his class named Urara Shiratori is the key to making the field trip go ahead. Urara is the granddaughter of the rich industrialist who's ordered the building that's preventing the field trip. It turns out that his daughter and son-in-law—Urara's parents—were killed by the Weiss, which drives him to build a bridge into Hell so he can try to seek vengeance. Keima uses Urara—who's a weird, sex-obsessed kid—to get to her grandfather and convince the old man (who doesn't look old at all; he looks like a thirty-year-old bishonen) to stop the construction. During the process, he also meets eight-year-old Ayumi, Chihiro, Yui, and Mio. (The latter two's rich fathers are acquainted with Urara's grandfather.) 

That accomplished, Keima finds that the school has been taken over by Vintage. They've locked all the boys up and caused a ranking number to appear on the back of all the girls' hands. No one is totally sure what it means, but they all go to barbaric lengths trying to increase their numbers. The goal is create gaps in their hearts and then infect them with loose souls. Allied with Vintage is Kaori, a mysterious sixth grade girl who is Number 1. Keima disguises himself as a girl, and along with Elsie, uses Tenri to break Vintage's control by having her compete with Kaori. Kaori tries to get Keima to team up with her, but Keima won't go along with it, and manages to defeat Kaori, while also realizing for the first time that Tenri is in love with him.

In the endgame, Keima tries putting the ball in a mysterious device inside the Akanemaru, which he discovered earlier and realized was somehow connected across time. He thinks this will let him return to his own time, and it's supposed to, but there's a battle going on on the other side. Urara's grandfather and Tenri have been left instructions by past Keima to make sure that everything goes as planned; to that end, Keima made sure that all the goddess carriers developed gaps in their hearts so that his future self would encounter them, leading the Goddesses to take residence inside them. He then gave Tenri a letter telling her that she had to bring all six Goddess carriers to the Akanemaru to complete the ritual. Urara's grandfather gets hold of Shiori, Tsukiyo, and Ayumi without much trouble; there's a bit of trouble getting Kanon and Yui, but his faithful female bodyguard handles it. 

Meanwhile, it turns out that Nikaido is Dokuro ten years later, and Dokuro is the reincarnation of Elsie's boss. Nikaido has been guided / assisted by Rimyuel, aka Kurakawa Akari, and is doing battle with Lune in the modern-day Akanemaru. Lune is trying to prevent the plan from coming to fruition. Nikaido manages to defeat her, but something goes wrong, and the world is pulled out of time. The six Goddess carriers end up in a big white emptiness, where Tenri explains what they have to do to get Keima back. Ayumi gets mad because Tenri alone knows what's going on, and because it turns out Keima was five-timing all of them, and runs off. Tenri manages to convince her to come back, and Vulcan leads the six goddesses in repairing time. 

The goddesses succeed, but giant beasts that look like Evas or the ancient weapon from Nausicaa are attacking Maijima (they're really the same thing, I think; after all, Hideaki Anno designed both). The goddesses fly off to defeat them, alongside Haqua and Nora, who also manage to get computer records that show a good number of devils to be Vintage members. A black giant thing that looks like a woman crouching appears in the middle of the city, which is apparently connected with the ancient weapons.

Here's where things get confusing. Granted, I wasn't following this story that closely; it's easy to forget the details when you get them in miserable squirts separated by a week (in the best case, when there aren't download errors) across two years. The goddesses have managed to send seven-year-old Keima (who was looked after by the goddess carriers in shifts the whole time; they all wanted to have a nice time with him, but he just screamed and played games) back to his body, but seventeen-year-old Keima hasn't come back to his body. We see him appear in an empty space, where Elsie serves him some kind of gross fanged fish. Keima has apparently figured out that Elsie is somehow a reincarnation of the big black thing that looks like a woman crouching. Elsie says Dokuro reincarnated her and kept her close by. She is happy she got to join his family. 

Everything disappears, and Keima is back in his room. He has a games binge, after which his mother drags him downstairs and he discovers that reality has somehow been altered so that Elsie is his real sister, Katsuragi Eri. His father just called to say he's coming home. 

Keima leaves, and ambushes Chihiro outside her house. After complaining that she kept him waiting too long, he confesses his love to her.

Apparently there's only one more chapter left in the series, so it certainly looks like Keima is going to end up with Chihiro. (I do think it would be disappointing if he ended the series the same way he started it. And I don't want them to do an Ore Imo and have him decide he's in love with "Eri" until they're both out of high school and then everything goes back to how it was at the start of the series.) Which is okay. They were a pretty good pair, and poor Chihiro deserves something after what happened to her during the Goddess Hunt. I think there was a bit more chemistry with Kanon, and more personal similarity with Shiori, and it's sad that poor Tenri doesn't get anything, but Chihiro's a pretty good choice. She is, after all, the only girl other than Tenri who decided that she loved Keima on her own, even seeing what a lame ass he normally is. And I'm glad they didn't do "first girl wins" and have Ayumi be the one.

By the way, it's not clear where Haqua comes in all this. Time has been revised so that Haqua has no idea Elsie ever existed, other than a few nagging feelings that there used to be another devil with her and Nora. It's not clear whether she's ever even met Keima in this timeline. Since I'm not a massive Haqua fan, I don't feel that loss as much as I do over Tenri, Kanon, and Shiori. It's even possible that the timeline has been revised so that the other goddess carriers don't remember him; that might be the punchline of the final chapter, that now he has to go romance a girl on his own, to be his girlfriend, without any question of loose souls.

This story wasn't as good as the Goddess Hunt Arc. But it certainly didn't fall prey to the mediocrity that so often afflicts manga who've just had a big, epic story and then try to have another (e.g. Yu Yu Hakusho's Demon World Arc, Rurouni Kenshin's Christian Arc). It's weird that Kami Nomi and Negima are the only manga I can think of that have managed it. Probably it's just my small sample size. But I'd like to think that their concentration on characters and relationships instead of special powers and super attacks gave them a certain depth that made the story move in an inevitable direction, rather than running out of steam. And I'm still looking forward to more of the Goddesses anime. (I've watched a few more episodes, through to where he's got all five girls on the hook and is just about to go on his crossdressing amusement park date with Yui. The story duelling scenes with Shiori were even more fun in the anime.)
