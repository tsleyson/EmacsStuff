I wanted to write about these two in the same place for some reason, so this will probably end up being a weird file. I'm going to interleave the sections on Kabukimonogatari and the sections on Hanamonogatari. It will probably end up really long, too (actually, it might not be, if neither of these books has any appearances of Karen and Tsukihi for me to either painstakingly recount or complain about the shortness or unsatisfactory nature thereof).

##Thoughts on Kabukimonogatari Chapters 1-12, begun Wednesday, January 9th, 2012:

Kabukimonogatari and Hanamonogatari both have the first few chapters translated on Baka Tsuki, so I began reading Kabukimonogatari's Mayoi Jiangshi until I ran out of chapters. As of Chapter 12, it's probably the worst story ever published under the Monogatari name. It pains me to say that, because I love Mayoi—that's actually one of its problems. Twelve chapters, and she hasn't even appeared yet. It opens with Koyomi talking about a new underclassman named Oshino Ougi who is an annoying smartass; he didn't meet Ougi until after Mayoi Jiangshi, but somehow figured it would be good to introduce her/him (in Mayoi Jiangshi Ougi is female; in Suruga Devil Ougi suddenly becomes male. In Tsubasa Tiger, the weird metafictional chapter skipping actually bore on the story, so I'm wondering if this will be the case with Ougi's gender switch). Koyomi then recounts buying ice cream for Yotsugi Ononoki, the familiar of Yodzuru Kagenui and the one who actually killed Tsukihi (nooooo!!!) in Tsukihi Phoenix. Yotsugi says she was dead, but Yodzuru brought her back to life as a familiar. She died, then came back to life; Yotsugi compares herself with Koyomi, who died without dying and now cannot die through normal means, and Mayoi (remember, she asked for directions just after the scene when Koyomi told Mayoi he loved Tsubasa, so she saw Mayoi) died and stayed dead, without actually losing her existence. Yotsugi ponders the meaning of her existence and asks Koyomi if he feels lucky. Koyomi says he does, though he later admits to himself he was lying, and Yotsugi asks him to ask Mayoi the same question.

It's the last day of summer vacation, and Shinobu reminds Koyomi that he hasn't finished a single piece of his summer homework. In a rather cheesy move, it turns out that Shinobu can use the spiritual power of that temple where Nadeko was doing the snake sacrifices to go back in time. She tries to go back one day, but after she tells Koyomi that she might have overshot a little, they leave the temple to find out if it's the kind of time travel where Koyomi from that time is also around or not and find out that Shinobu sent them back eleven years by mistake.

Koyomi wants to buy erotic books and manga from before the restrictions on loli material that were enacted in 2004 (if I remember correctly), but I guess Japan changed the appearance of its currency between 199x and 200x, and all of Koyomi's money is from the future, also putting an end to his idea to buy stocks. (As long as his present was before 2008, he's probably all right with stocks.) He goes to his house and discovers his seven-year-old self outside; he previously described himself at that age as a "shota", and Shinobu apparently agrees, because she expresses a desire to do to shota Koyomi what Koyomi does to Mayoi. (Shinobu acts weird in this book. She claims it's because she's connected to Koyomi now and is absorbing his personality, but he later discovers evidence that she's lying.)

Being Koyomi, Koyomi decides that since he can't make money or get loli books, he wants to try and help one of his friends. Shinobu tells him that he can't actually change anything, because the universe works to prevent all time paradoxes; for example, if he tried to kill his shota form, something would happen to stop him, like a truck driving in front of him just as he fired the gun or his knife breaking its blade or his shota form becoming a Super Saiyan and defeating him. (Not Shinobu's example.) Koyomi decides he wants to try anyway. He first thinks about Hitagi and Tsubasa, but Hitagi's problems haven't even begun yet in this period, so he can't do anything. Tsubasa's problems, on the other hand, are already too far advanced to be solved; it isn't as if he can convince her "parents" to love her, or prevent her real mother from committing suicide. Suruga similarly didn't have problems in this period, and Nadeko was only three years old. (By the way, I wanted to see three-year-old Tsukihi and four-year-old Karen in addition to shota Koyomi.) Koyomi notices, however, that it's eleven years ago the day before Mother's Day—the very day Mayoi died—and decides it must be a sign. He wants to prevent Mayoi's death. When Shinobu tells him that's impossible, because something else will just kill Mayoi to preserve time, he revises his goal to enabling Mayoi to visit her mother so that when she dies, she won't become a ghost and wander for ten years.

Koyomi goes to find Tsunade's house and happens to run into seven-year-old Tsubasa. He freaks out, screaming that he wanted to see loli Hanekawa and how novel it is to see a flat-chested Tsubasa. Loli Tsubasa is frightened that a creepy high school student knows her name; when Koyomi calms himself down and asks if she knows where Tsunade's house is, loli Tsubasa points him to the nearest police station. But Koyomi realizes the police probably know where Tsunade lives; he gets a map from a friendly policewoman who comments on how terrible the divorce was for poor Mayoi. He goes to the ruins of the cram school to sleep, only to find that the school hasn't even been built yet. 

It's the time travel thing. I don't like it when fantasy stories have time travel; it just seems wrong somehow, like a sci-fi story having a wizard. I know this was the only way to really resolve Mayoi's storyline, but I just don't like it. Also, while seeing loli Tsubasa and shota Koyomi was great (even if we didn't actually "see" them, since it's a book), why hasn't Mayoi appeared? Couldn't she at least have gotten to appear in the prologue instead of Ougi? And also, using Yotsugi was a borderline case—she did already appear—but I don't see why we need new characters at this point, so why Ougi?  Maybe he/she will be useful enough in Suruga Devil to justify his/her existence.

##Thoughts on the first five or so chapters of Hanamonogatari, same day as above:

Hanamonogatari contains the story Suruga Devil, which is narrated by Suruga. At first, I thought this was weird; Suruga hardly struck me as the narrator type. Now that I've read a few chapters, I see that it couldn't have been any other way.

I seriously considered putting Suruga higher than Nadeko in my recent character ranking. I probably like them about equally right now. Most Monogatari fans seem to be smartass English majors like me (well, former English major), so characters like Hitagi and Suruga with dark sides are very popular, while innocent characters like Nadeko are acknowledged to be cute, but not considered as interesting (I felt similarly about Manami in Ore Imo—I didn't hate her and she was pretty cute, but other characters were more interesting). Tsubasa also seems to be pretty popular, since she does have a dark side. I'm actually surprised by how popular Suruga is—of course, as I said, I like her too, I just didn't expect so many people to have her as their absolute favorite. (I bet it's the unrequited lesbian love—that sort of thing is both sweet and erotic.) With Suruga Devil, I might end up having to swap Suruga with Nadeko after all. If things go well enough, I might even have to swap Suruga with Mayoi. (Depending on how things go in Mayoi Jiangshi.) [Dec 20th 2013: Now that I've seen Mayoi-chan's farewell scene in Shinobu Time, I don't think it's happening. Mayoi-chan and Tsubasa are basically embedded where they are, given the great conclusions to their stories. Still liking Suruga, but Nadeko is also much safer after Otori.]

In the first chapter, we finally hear something about Suruga's parents, which was alluded to in Nisemonogatari when Suruga describes the distance her grandparents keep from her affairs. Suruga tells us how her mother was a strange woman who was always making cynical and complicated remarks; she treated her young daughter like a miniature adult and often told her whatever cynical things were on her mind. Suruga's mother eloped to marry the heir of the Kanbaru family, and they ended up dying together in a car crash that was sort of a double suicide. Suruga remembers her father fondly enough, but says neither he nor her mother seemed like the sort of romantic who would elope. 

The grandparents she lives with are her father's parents, the grandparents from the Kanbaru side, and Suruga says that although she wasn't blessed with terribly good parents, she did at least end up with good grandparents. She blames her ineptitude at domestic chores on how well they take care of her, and says that she never eats breakfast with them because she runs in the morning, but she always tries to run faster so she can get back and eat with them, though she never succeeds. It was clear from this scene that Suruga duly loves and appreciates her grandparents, even if she feels some tension about living with them. Suruga also describes how she duct tapes her left arm to a pillar every night before she goes to sleep; the idea is that if the Rainy Devil takes control and tries to leave and the tape stops it, good, and if it rips through the tape, at least Suruga will know what happened. After breakfast, she reads the newspaper and checks the times of every violent crime, making sure she couldn't have possibly committed any of them.

Earlier, when Suruga described her grandmother waking her and saying it was a new term, I thought we were going back to the same day that Tsubasa Tiger began, the day Koyomi went back in time to avoid, but it turns out that Suruga Devil takes place at the start of the next school year, in April of the next year. Suruga describes how Koyomi barely graduated, but his kowtowing powers and the intervention of Tsubasa managed to get him out, and now he, Hitagi, and Tsubasa are all gone. Suruga held sort of a party for them, surprised at how it all ended without drama, with a feeling more like "So that's it." Now she feels lonely and aimless, with no one she can talk about kai with and no goal similar to when she entered Naoetsu High School to follow Hitagi. The only person at school she knows anymore is Ougi, who she meets upon leaving her house (after a scene where she ends up cutting her fingernails with scissors, because she's lost three pairs of fingernail clippers and doesn't want to ask her grandmother for another pair and get yelled at for losing so many. She tries to describe how lateral thinking is her strong point, but ends up describing an incident where she tried to wrench the tape on a box open with the buckle of her watchband and instead broke the watch). Ougi has somehow become male, and when Suruga mentions this, he says he's always been male and he definitely isn't one of those "traps" that's popular right now. He also claims to be the ace of the going-home club; he says you become the ace by going home before school even ends about once every three days. This was as far as I read.

Like Tsubasa Tiger, Suruga Devil could only have been narrated by Suruga. In particular, we never could have gotten the flavor of Tooe Gaen's interactions with her daughter if the narrator were Koyomi (and also, he's gone, so he couldn't have really narrated a story about Suruga). Unlike Tsubasa, Suruga's style isn't notably different from Koyomi's; in fact, during the prologue, I thought it was Koyomi until it actually said "I, Suruga Kanbaru,...". Also, seeing how Suruga lives through her own eyes—the fear she feels that she might be taken over by the Rainy Devil and give in to her subconscious desire for violence, the measures she takes to prevent it, the way she feels and thinks about her grandparents and Koyomi, Hitagi, and Tsubasa—made me feel closer to her, and made her more real and not just an erotic lesbian sports girl. On the other hand, Ougi?! Why did we need this character? (I would like Suruga Devil to provide me a convincing reason.)

The suddenness of Koyomi's graduation and disappearance makes me think that one of the other novels probably backtracks and covers this event in more detail. Possibly Hitagi End—please tell me it's not just a novel full of lovey-dovey scenes between Koyomi and Hitagi. Even acknowledging that I still like Hitagi, and was just angry at her and finally managed to stop being so angry, I can't take that. It was all right when they were still building their relationship in Suruga Monkey and Tsubasa Cat, but even by Karen Bee it was stale. I almost expect it to turn out that Suruga's in some kind of weird Matrix-like sealed reality and Ougi is the "watcher", and when she returns to the real world, Koyomi et al. won't have graduated. (Probably not, but Mayoi Jiangshi had time travel, you know.)

Anyway, I really liked this novel so far. It got off to a good start and I hope it can maintain its pace. I just have one complaint: no Karen?! Did Karen stop hanging out with Suruga or something? Even after she let Koyomi brush her teeth for a chance at meeting Suruga? Where's Karen?! Angry!! Hulk smash!! If they needed a character for Suruga to interact with so things wouldn't get boring, it should have been Karen, not Ougi! Karen, Karen, Karen!!!

(Though I don't know if Karen could get into that high school, with her brain. Poor Karen, so unloved by Tsubasa and Suruga both. I hope she will appear later, at least briefly. An appearance by Tsukihi is likely too much to hope for.)

##Friday, January 11th, 2013, on my new Toshiba computer:

Otori:
I've decided to add Otorimonogatari to this file. Kabukimonogatari, Hanamonogatari, and Otorimonogatari are all being slowly, painstakingly translated on Baka-Tsuki, so that's probably why it felt right to put them all in the same file, treating them each one chapter at a time.

Actually, at first I remembered wrongly and had called Hanamonogatari Otorimonogatari. That's probably because I was thinking something like “The book with Nadeko's story must be Hanamonogatari, because Nadeko is flowery and stuff.” That turned out to be wrong. Suruga Devil is in Hanamonogatari, and Nadeko Medusa is in Otorimonogatari.

I read the first few chapters of Nadeko Medusa, the only ones translated, and was hooked. Suruga Devil managed to catch my attention because I liked Suruga and felt like I wanted to know more about her, and it gave me that. Nadeko is a character who pretty much begins and ends with “Quiet, cute, childish, loves Koyomi”, and to be honest, I don't really want to find out that she's evil or has a dark side because that's not who she is, and it's too late to change that now. That's why Nadeko Medusa catches the reader's attention by flashing forward to a later scene, a scene in which Nadeko is hiding under the floor of the shrine where she was doing the snake sacrifices and talking to a white snake wrapped around her wrist. The snake tells Nadeko everything is her fault before the entire shrine gets blown away somehow. In the rain, Nadeko comes face to face with Koyomi and Shinobu. Koyomi tells her he's there to kill her. Nadeko's hair begins turning into snakes, and she prepares to do battle.

Then we backtrack.

Nadeko began her day normally. She was nearly run over by Ougi on the way to school. Ougi is once again female and tells Nadeko that she's Oshino Meme's niece, and that Nadeko has just been playing the victim this whole time, but it's time for her to become someone who victimizes others. Nadeko describes in her narration how she uses a strategy of looking down and not speaking until people become so disgusted with her that they leave, to avoid talking to people. She thinks she feels a white snake in her shoe locker and panics, but nothing is there. That's as far as we got, but the second chapter did its job of getting me interested. I doubt the story ends with Nadeko dying, but her narration suggests that she's finally acknowledged that she can't be with Koyomi, and she may be acting on the one motive that I could actually believe would make her do dark things, jealousy over Koyomi.

Perhaps the novel version of Nadeko Snake was a bit more detailed, but based on the anime, until this point, Nadeko hasn't had many good scenes. I hope that we'll get lots of them in Nadeko Medusa. Unlike with Suruga, the idea of Nadeko narrating a story makes some sense (because she seems intelligent and because she keeps so much to herself). Her narration is laid-back, more like Tsubasa's in many ways, but it also has some digressions and rambling, meta-referential conversations like Koyomi's, including one during the third chapter when Nadeko is thinking that it's all thanks to Koyomi that she can enjoy these peaceful, halcyon days, and then digresses to mention how “C-On” (-cyon) sounds like the name of a yon-koma manga. (Coincidentally, K-On is pretty much all about people living out halcyon days of youth.) Also, Nadeko's narration is the closest any Monogatari novel comes to third-person narration, because she keeps switching between referring to herself as “I” and as “Nadeko” (I suspect that “I” is a translation of when she left the pronoun unstated in Japanese, and she used “Nadeko” everywhere in the Japanese version; I've seen that convention used elsewhere, and it's a good balance between preserving the unique features of the original language and driving us crazy. Also, in the anime I can't remember her ever saying “watashi” or “atashi”, just nothing or “Nadeko”, as in Tsubasa Cat Part 4 when she said “Nadeko ni denwa shita?” when Koyomi called). 

After reading the novels, it actually makes some sense that Nadeko would fall in love with Koyomi in particular, above just a fixation on an older boy or her desire for a sibling. Nadeko deals with people by not dealing with them; she hates talking to strangers and doesn't like being touched on her bare skin (apparently she finds the body heat of others unpleasant; she refuses to shake hands with Ougi). Well, for one thing, since Nadeko is like that, Koyomi was convenient, because he was a boy, and he was built in to her relationship with Tsukihi. But also, we now know that Koyomi had no friends and was known as a “motionless mute”; even if he wasn't as much like this back when Nadeko first knew him, the fact that he ended up like this means he was probably the sort of person who would respect and understand Nadeko's personality (and she also may not have been as much like this back then). I actually think that, unlike most “younger girl with a crush” characters, Nadeko is a pretty good match for Koyomi. She seems to actually like his personality, and not just like him because he was built in to her relationship with Tsukihi or because he saved her from the snake curse. He seems to like her and be understanding of her feelings, though it's hard to say whether he has any deeper feelings or if she's just a cute younger girl who looks good in buruma and school swimsuits. (He certainly didn't pine for her for years like she did for him, since he forgot she existed until he saw her again in Nadeko Snake.) When the time inevitably comes that Koyomi must defeat the last boss and tell Nadeko that he can't return her feelings, I hope he'll let her down easy like he did Tsubasa. But Nadeko may not know that Koyomi has a girlfriend or have seen repeatedly how devoted he is to her, like Tsubasa, and she's also not as mature as Tsubasa. She's younger, but she's also even younger mentally than her actual age, so she may not be able to handle her emotions as well as Tsubasa was able to, which might lead to some of the trouble that's faced during this story.

Hanamonogatari:
Suruga Devil moves into its main plot in Chapters 7 and 8 when Suruga asks her former basketball teammate Higasa about a rumor she heard from Ougi about someone who calls herself “Lord Devil”. Lord Devil gives people advice on their problems, meeting secretly with only those who she approves personally. It sounds harmless enough, but the word “devil” catches Suruga's interest since she doesn't think any benign entity would call itself a devil.

Next, the moment I was waiting for occurs—Suruga needs to know how to contact Lord Devil and arrange a meeting, so she calls none other than Karen!! Someone must have heard me throwing a tantrum last time due to the lack of Karen. I think it's probably just a token appearance—it doesn't seem Karen will play any major role in the story—but it's better than nothing. Karen has graduated from Tsuganoki No. 2 Middle School and moved up automatically to Tsuganoki No. 2 High School. The Fire Sisters have broken up (Suruga recalls Koyomi complaining that he had to clean up from their breakup party, though she thinks he seemed sad that it was the last time he'd ever clean up after them), but Tsukihi is still active at the middle school under the name “Moonfire” (Suruga thinks it sounds like a lame sentai show). Neither Karen nor Tsukihi is planning to go after Lord Devil, so Suruga arranges a face-to-face meeting, and the chapter ends.

The appearance of Ougi in Mayoi Jiangshi, Suruga Devil, and Nadeko Medusa, with gender swap in Suruga Devil, suggests that Ougi is somehow important to the plots of all three stories. As long as Ougi is a plot device and not a character who steals appearances from Karen, Tsukihi, or anyone else (I'd even rather see Hitagi than some obnoxious new character) I won't complain too much.

Koimonogatari:
A few chapters of Hitagi End are also translated. I'm not going to read any more until finishing with at least the three other stories I'm discussing in this file, but I did read the first one, and it sure was unexpected.

Being a Nisio Isin story, there was no chance of the fears I expressed above about Hitagi End coming to pass. In fact, Nisio Isin made the incredibly bizarre choice of casting Kaiki as the narrator of Hitagi End. In the prologue Kaiki introduces himself as the narrator and does his usual thing of talking in circles about his deceitfulness and how easy the human inclination to believe makes his “job”--he even mentions the neutrinos that were briefly thought to have moved faster than the speed of light, violating relativity, before it was discovered that a timing error was to blame, and says that humans were all so eager to believe in the theory of relativity when they should have doubted it.

Making Kaiki the narrator is a really weird choice. I guess he had to come back in somehow—it would be a waste to have a great villain wandering around in your world and not use him. But it's weird. It's just weird. It's especially weird for a story whose main theme is supposed to be the love between Koyomi and Hitagi. It's just weird. Weird.

I want more Karen. And some Tsukihi.

##Saturday, January 12th, 2013:

Nise:
A very few chapters of Karen Bee and the prologue of Tsukihi Phoenix are also translated, so I also read some of those (I read Karen Bee in Spanish, in which language it is known as "Abeja Karen" and Karen's hair is described as "cola de caballo"). The prologue of Karen Bee had some nice Karen and Tsukihi-related anecdotes that weren't in the anime. For instance, Koyomi talks about the day before Karen was due to start middle school; trying to shake things up, she dyed her hair pink. She somehow thought that in a small town where even minor modifications to the school uniform are cause for freak-outs, she could get away with this. Koyomi tells us that their mother hit Karen in the head when she saw the pink hair, although he adds that in fairness to their mother, it was the only time she had ever hit one of her children in the head. She then made Karen dye it back, which didn't totally succeed, leaving Karen's hair a dirty grey color with pink spots for a little while. Koyomi wasn't around when it happened, but wishes he had been.

He also illustrates Tsukihi's sociopathic tendencies with a story from grade school. Tsukihi's class was in the garden planting "girasoles" (I think those are sunflowers, but I don't remember) when a soccer ball came flying in from a higher grade's PE class. One of the girls in Tsukihi's class went to ask them to be more careful and came back crying. Tsukihi decided to wreak vengeance. She went to the classroom (Koyomi figures she brought Karen too) of the offending boy, asked where he was, and did something horrible to him. She then went on to put half the class in the hospital, and just to be extra evil, sent them "girasoles" as a get-well present. This incident shows that Tsukihi would make a great mob enforcer.

Koyomi complains that his relatives are always telling him that Karen and Tsukihi are sisters that he can be proud of, but that he doubts they tell Karen and Tsukihi that he's a brother they can be proud of (though it seems like they don't need to be told that, because Karen in particular seems to have modeled her life after his—fighting for justice in middle school, then calming down upon entering high school. She acknowledged in Tsukihi Phoenix Part 1 that he was the one who inspired her love for justice). He opens the prologue by saying he doubts anyone wants to hear about those two, which is totally wrong, because many of us would like to hear more about them. Maybe we'll get to as the rest of Nise is translated.

By the way, there's a slight hope (more like a last, desperate hope) that Tsukihi will appear in Nadeko Medusa, and maybe she will finally appear together with Nadeko (I'm not holding my breath, though).

##Kabuki/Otori Sunday, May 12th, 2013:

I noticed this a while ago, but didn't think to write about it at the time: Nisio Isin really tricked us with Nadeko, at least in a subtle way. Usually, characters like her are studious and smart, and her self-study leading her to attempt a counter-curse in Nadeko Snake gave the impression that Nadeko was the same, but she's actually not. In the novel version of Karen Bee, Koyomi notices that Nadeko's books all seem to be plundered from the shelves of her father's study in an attempt to look grown up and smart. In Mayoi Jiangshi, Shinobu suggests that Koyomi ask his friends for help with his homework. Koyomi knows that Tsubasa won't help him and doesn't want to risk making Hitagi backslide into evil after her transformation into a decent human being at the end of Tsukihi Phoenix, so Shinobu suggests asking Nadeko or Suruga. Koyomi says that Nadeko is horrible—apparently he asked her during summer break when they were playing together if she was doing her homework properly, and her response was something like "Why do I have to do something so boring? It's okay, it'll all end with just getting yelled at." Koyomi says that he's only recently begun to realize that Nadeko is just quiet and calm, but is neither diligent nor smart, and that he had a look at her homework, and while her handwriting was beautiful due to her study of calligraphy, her answers were all wrong. (We were also mildly tricked with Suruga; as Koyomi mentions in this same scene, Suruga is actually a pretty good student, and we heard the same from her classmates when Tsubasa visited her class during Neko White. By the way, when Shinobu suggests asking his sisters, Koyomi thinks that Tsukihi, at least, might be able to handle it, but his pride won't let him, which Shinobu says is stupid since he already tried relying on an eight-year-old girl to bring him back in time.)

Finally, in the first chapter of Otori, Nadeko lists her most recent grades among her stats. Japan apparently uses numbers instead of letters; in Neko Black, Koyomi says that Tsukihi gets all fives, which is equivalent to straight A's. Nadeko's grade sheet is pretty mediocre; she has threes in English and Japanese, so she seems to be not entirely terrible at languages, and she has fours in social studies and art, but she has twos in math, science, music, and PE (the opposite of Koyomi, whose best subject is math). Her only five is in Skills and Family, which I assume is similar to home economics. 

All this time I've been thinking of Nadeko as the only Bakemonogatari heroine who didn't defy her type in some way (Mayoi-chan's intelligence, Hitagi's bold romantic actions, Suruga's eroticism and studiousness, and Tsubasa's awesomeness all go against their types of energetic loli, tsundere, sports girl, and class president; Karen-chan's being a shounen hero in a cute middle school girl's body and Tsukihi-chan's psychotic hysteria go against their types as well, although Tsukihi-chan fits a type if you consider her a yandere). It's small, but it's another testament to Nisio-san's writing skills.

##Thoughts on Otori Chapters 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, written Sunday, May 26th, 2013:

First I want to expand a little on my statements above about the characters defying their types, particularly in the case of Mayoi-chan. A lot of shows have an energetic loli who induces the main character to childish fights. Mayoi-chan is similar. A lot of times, the energetic loli also has an unusual awareness of sex, for the lolicons, which Mayoi-chan also has, although not to the extent of the worst of them (she never jump-glomps Koyomi or makes insinuating remarks about doing what adults do; in fact, Koyomi forces those things on her, though she seems to weirdly enjoy them when he does them). The sexual awareness is a way of making the loli character more mentally mature so that she has some appeal as a romantic interest for an adult lolicon; after all, children lack the usual physical and mental characteristics that make someone romantically attractive to adults, which is why it's usually the case that only adults with serious mental illness are romantically attracted to them. But with Mayoi-chan, Nisio-san has an interesting twist on this; Mayoi-chan isn't more mature only because she has little breasts or because she's unusually aware of sex, but also because she's intelligent and verbally skilled. Mayoi-chan and Koyomi do get in childish wrestling matches, but they also have verbal duels that are every bit as frenetic and clever as those Koyomi has with Suruga or Hitagi. Mayoi might even be smarter than Nadeko (since Nadeko's actually not that smart); it's even possible that she's smarter than everyone in the series except Tsubasa, but since she's young, she hasn't reached the full bloom of her genius.

Regarding Tsubasa's awesomeness, it's common for class president-type characters to show a lot of resolve and courage in pursuit of enforcing the rules, but Tsubasa goes totally beyond that with the way she faces down vampires and vampire hunters in Kizumonogatari and the Inflaming Tiger in Nekomonogatari White. Far from being the usual well-meaning but somewhat rigid and narrow-minded class president type, she's pretty accepting of Suruga's yuri traits and Koyomi's various weirdnesses, and also has hyper-genius characteristics like a way smarter Lelouch.

Regarding Tsukihi-chan, her first few appearances in Bakemonogatari tricked me into thinking she was a placid, yamato nadeshiko tea ceremony girl type. After her first conversation with Koyomi in Nise, it was clear that she wasn't. Actually, I would say that Tsukihi-chan is one of the only characters who genuinely does not fit into any type. She's sort of a yandere and tends to that type in comedy moments, but her other traits of being extremely smart, lazy, devious, slippery, verbally clever, socially skilled, fickle, fashionable, and even a little kind, don't fit into any type I can think of. (Regarding the last one: she played with Nadeko, both as a child and as a teenager after Koyomi reunited with Nadeko. Nadeko's far from popular, so Tsukihi-chan was a good enough person to choose her friends based on personality and not popularity. She was also kind to Koyomi in Neko Black, both in giving him romantic advice and in comforting him when he runs in in a panic from discovering that Tsubasa doesn't have a room. Of course, she also gives him a hard time, but that just seems to be their relationship; Koyomi gives her and Karen-chan both a hard time whenever they're at his mercy in some way.)

Now, regarding Otori, there actually isn't that much to say. The story just barely gets going in Chapter 7, and it's over. The translator has translator's block so there won't be any more Otori. (He seemed to think it was a personal problem, but I suspect that he just got tired after translating Nekomonogatari White. Monogatari in general is ridiculously hard to translate, and while Otori isn't bad, it's probably not paying off like Neko White; in my opinion, Neko White was the best of any of the novels, and I would love to see it become anime.) Essentially, Nadeko sees a white snake everywhere, so she calls Koyomi asking for help. Koyomi doesn't seem too concerned and tells Nadeko to go home and he'll come over at ten that night after Shinobu's awake; he wants to get Shinobu's knowledge of kai that she gained from Oshino.

The white snake speaks to Nadeko and tells her to go to Kitashirahebi Shrine, where she killed all those snakes before. It claims to be a representative of all the snakes she murdered and offers her the chance to redeem herself. Nadeko takes it, without really thinking about it, even though the snake itself says that the smarter thing would be to go home and wait for Koyomi.

We do discover some interesting side information in these chapters. First, Kaiki's charms have completely wrecked Nadeko's class. Everyone is afraid to speak to anyone else for fear that they might end up finding out that the other person bought some kind of charm to use against them. Apparently no one else has had a terrible situation like what happened with Nadeko, but they've found out who likes whom, who hates whom, what friends really think of each other, and lots of other unpleasant information, according to who bought charms. It somehow made all of their relationships so fractured that they just don't speak; Nadeko says that it's as if everyone's become like her. It's so bad that she even thinks about trying to say "Good morning" just to get someone talking.

We also hear a little about what happened to Tsubasa after Neko White. Apparently Tsubasa and Nadeko had a heart-to-heart at some point during which Tsubasa gave Nadeko lots of good advice. (This must have happened after Neko White, because Tsubasa and Nadeko were sufficiently unacquainted at the end of Neko White that Tsubasa didn't talk to Nadeko when she saw Nadeko with her family on the street.) Nadeko even says that she realized a lot of things about herself thanks to Tsubasa's advice, though she laments that just because the advice makes you realize something about yourself doesn't mean you actually act on that realization. Nadeko tells us that she ran away from Tsubasa on their first meeting because she had some sort of visceral reaction, as if she could sense the awesomeness flowing within Tsubasa and fled from it in fear of its power (sort of like Medaka Box's Hinokage, who was so strong that people forgot he existed). She later learned that Tsubasa is a very nice person and learned not to be so scared of her, but she remarked to Koyomi that Tsubasa is a little different, something Koyomi agreed with. When Koyomi mentions using Shinobu's knowledge, he says he'd like to talk to Tsubasa, but she's gone. She decided to take leave from school and do a pilot world trip as preparation for the real thing. I imagine that was a convenient way to get her out of the way, because if she were around, I suspect the plot of this novel would be resolved a lot more easily. Tsubasa is probably the only one who could help Nadeko through the discovery that she can't be with Koyomi; she's been through it herself, and she's mature and intelligent and has Nadeko's respect. Nadeko is quiet and calm enough that I imagine Tsubasa could successfully pacify her if she were around and stop a lot of the bad things alluded to in the prologue from happening. So Tsubasa needed to be out of the way, leaving Koyomi with no one to rely on but the more erratic Shinobu.

By the way, I'm curious to know if Nadeko continued to hang out with Suruga. They're cute together, and Suruga definitely likes Nadeko. (I was hoping they would be on the Nadeko Snake audio commentary together.) If they did, it's possible Suruga could talk some sense into Nadeko about the lost romance; she did lose her romance with Hitagi, but like Tsubasa, she was able to be happy for the object of her affections and become friends with her onetime rival.

I'm sorry that Otori won't be translated anymore. Mayoi Jiangshi and Suruga Devil seem to be on permanent hiatus too. The novels actually continue after Hitagi End with stories about Yotsugi, but to be honest, I don't care about anything that doesn't at least follow the original heroines. I really want to see more Karen and Tsukihi, and I'm happy with stories about Mayoi-chan, Suruga, Tsubasa, or Nadeko; I don't even mind some more Hitagi-centered stories, and I could read a novel about Shinobu, or even one that centered heavily on Koyomi (similar to Kizu). But when you start getting into Yotsugi, Yozuru, Izuko Gaen, and Episode, I just don't care anymore. It might be part of the Monogatari series, but it's not a part I particularly want to read, just like I enjoyed the Star Wars trilogy but didn't feel any urge to read a book about the unknown adventures of Wedge or the shady past of Lando. 

It's been an interesting experience with Monogatari, being a fan of the characters that don't have as many fans. I usually like characters that everyone likes—Azu-nyan and Mugi; Fuko, Kotomi, and Nagisa; Asuka and Misato; Kirino, Kuroneko, and Ayase; Kanon, Shiori, Elsie, and Tenri—so I hadn't really had the experience of being the embattled Rei fan whose favorite character barely gets any exposure. Now I've had it, and it's not very fun. Despite the fact that I saw quite enough of Hitagi during the series, she's still a real part of the Monogatari series, not a minor footnote like Yotsugi, so another story about her doesn't feel so tangential as one about Yotsugi. Doing novels about Yotsugi sort of reminds me of Kakifly's weird dual story structure for the K-On continuation (which, by the way, is coming out in the US). 

##The anime of Kabukimonogatari, September 27th, 2013:

The Monogatari: Second Season anime has moved into the Mayoi Jiangshi story. In the previous Monogatari anime, I missed a lot of the dialogue and miscellaneous weirdnesses from the novel that didn't get in, though the anime often has compensating weirdnesses (like Hitagi playing with sugar cubes as if she were a genius detective whose name and face were unknown to the world during Tsubasa Tiger). There was some good stuff that got cut from Mayoi Jiangshi, like the conversation about Nadeko's and Suruga's study methods where Koyomi reveals that, contrary to expectation, Nadeko is the lazy one and Suruga is the diligent one. The setup also felt a little rushed; Koyomi goes from wanting to finish summer homework to wanting to save Mayoi in a heartbeat. But most of what was cut was just pointless filler that dragged on for fifteen chapters with no purpose. Like Tsubasa Tiger, the chapter numbers are displayed on-screen, and during the climax of the first half, when Koyomi and Shinobu have decided to save Mayoi and are trying to do so, the numbers were just zipping by. I wouldn't be surprised if the translation on the novel ground to a halt because the translators were just so damned tired of the pointlessness of it all. 

In other words, the anime improves on the novel. What takes 19 chapters in the novel takes two episodes in the anime, and all the best scenes are retained—shota Koyomi, loli Hanekawa, the friendly neighborhood policewoman (who looks oddly like Koyomi's mother, apparently known to some fans as Mamaragi—maybe I'm reading way too much into this), conversations with Shinobu about her views on time paradoxes. And if they haven't egregiously cut from the conclusion of the first part, those fifteen chapters weren't worth it. After Chapter 15, the last chapter of the translation, Koyomi runs off in a panic upon discovering that Mayoi left at five that morning, only to find her consulting the map in the park just like when they first met. He can't resist flipping up her skirt to see her panties—which have a snail on them—and blames it on the timeline trying to preserve itself. Mayoi-chan runs away in a panic, almost getting run over, but Koyomi saves her and fortunately, she didn't see his face when he flipped her skirt, so he pretends to be a great guy and Good Samaritan and guides her to her mother's house, waiting until she gets inside and breathing a sigh of relief. Then he and Shinobu return to the present, with an ominous cliffhanger.

Since I didn't care that much what happened in this story, I have some idea what happens—back in the present, it turns out that since Koyomi never met Mayoi-chan, she wasn't around at the beginning of Tsubasa Cat to tell him Shinobu had escaped. As a consequence, he wasn't out looking for Shinobu, and Black Hanekawa killed him. Enraged, Shinobu resumed a vampiric form and started turning everyone into vampire zombies, destroying the entire town. No one knows what happened to Tsukihi-chan. (Since she's a kai, she presumably can't become a vampire zombie. She's probably huddled under a cardboard box in the rain, waiting for a strong, cool, blonde, tsundere girl to come along and take her in so she can call that girl Oniichan. By the way, I cared more about what happened to Tsukihi-chan than about the main story.) Koyomi meets adult Mayoi-chan (she'd be about twenty) and they team up somehow to change everything back. (I think adult Mayoi-chan somehow gains her memories of meeting him and admits that she didn't mind dying so much because she was happy to have met him.) So there is a time paradox after all, because if Koyomi died at the end of Tsubasa Cat, he was never able to go back in time and stop himself from meeting Mayoi-chan. I guess if he had somehow been killed by Kako at the end of Tsubasa Tiger, there wouldn't be a paradox since that comes after this.

Loli Tsubasa was adorable. We see Koyomi's fantasies about tossing her up in the air and swinging her around interspersed with him chasing her in circles and attacking her, yelling "It's all flat! It's all flat!" They cut out a lot of Koyomi's more horrible moments in the anime, like suggesting they collect banned loli porn to bring back to the future, although the moments they left in are priceless. I think the first moment it really hit me how weird and awesome this series is was the scene in Mayoi Snail Part 1 when Koyomi and Mayoi get in a fight and he slams her on the ground, exposing her panties, and then laughs and exults in his victory. (And then says in his narration, "There stood a horrible high school student, exulting in his victory over a grade schooler. I would like to say that's not me.")

The opening, "Happy Bite", didn't immediately enthrall me—somewhat like "Chocolate Insomnia", which took me a minute to develop a liking for—but the animation was cute. Mayoi-chan is lost again, this time in a world of pink blocks that looks like Q-Bert designed by M.C. Escher. (Since I'm reading Gödel, Escher, Bach right now, I can honestly say that.) Sadly, I don't think either "Chocolate Insomnia" or "Happy Bite" would have reached the top of my list if I'd heard them before watching the show, though I guess the same is true of "Kaerimichi" and "Ambivalent World" and even "Platinum Disco". It's just a tribute to their awesomeness that "Renai Circulation", "Staple Stable", and "Marshmallow Justice" were good before I even knew the show. (Some people in a forum were complaining that Nadeko topped a poll and saying it was all because of "Renai Circulation", which I can understand, because I don't even like Nadeko that much anymore but I can't bring myself to dislike her because of "Renai Circulation" and Kana Hanazawa. By the way, I read that Nisio Isin decided to make Nadeko go evil in Nadeko Medusa because Kana Hanazawa expressed a desire to play an evil character. Listening to how well she played Kuroneko, especially in some of Kuroneko's weirder scenes like the one where she became Kamineko, I think she'd be good at playing an evil character, though she's sort of typecast in the cute roles, especially after playing the bodaciously adorable Kobato [from the CLAMP series; while Kobato Hasegawa is also bodaciously adorable, she's not well known enough to typecast Kana Hanazawa].)

##Mayoi Jiangshi Anime Part 3, October 3rd, 2013:

When Koyomi and Shinobu return, the streets are empty. Koyomi's house is empty, and he can't find any of his friends anywhere. Figuring they screwed up and had better go back in time again to fix things, they return to the shrine, but find that Oshino put a mega talisman that absorbs all the energy and locks it up inside on the now-fallen shrine. As kai, neither Koyomi nor Shinobu can touch it. As night falls, they are suddenly surrounded by zombies. (That look like a reuse of the design for that Flicker's boyfriend in the fourth episode of The Soul Taker. Come to think of it, wasn't that animated by Shaft? Maybe I should rewatch that; I might find something to like now that I'm on board with Shaft and not trying to look cool or anything. Also, almost anything can be improved by not having commercial breaks every five seconds.) The zombies won't approach the shrine, so Shinobu holds Koyomi back within its radius, then jumps a million miles into the air (then why didn't she do that herself during Neko White, instead of having Black Hanekawa do it?) [she had lost her powers because she was separated from Koyomi, so she couldn't.]. They maintain a holding pattern at 300 meters above the ground until daytime and return to the surface. On the ground, they find a newspaper from the evening of July 14th, and Shinobu suddenly realizes what happened.

When she ran away, she had a plan: if Koyomi didn't find her, she was going to destroy the world by turning everyone into vampires. In this world, Koyomi was killed by Black Hanekawa on the night of June 14th  instead of overcoming it with the help of Shinobu and making everything good. Due to the magic of exponential growth, Shinobu turned a few people into vampires and pretty soon the whole world was vampires. She then killed herself; lacking a master, the new vampires all became zombies. Shinobu is actually sad because she carried through such a plan for such a childish reason in this reality, but Koyomi comforts her and says it isn't her fault, since the Shinobu currently with him never did carry through that plan. 

The next day they go to "Costco" and stock up on supplies. Koyomi also gets all the fireworks he can find. His plan is to launch fireworks in case there are any survivors from the vampire zombie apocalypse lurking in the city; they'll see the fireworks, and figuring zombies can't launch fireworks and it must be a human, come to see. He and Shinobu put on yukata and have a summer fireworks party, launching them all, waving sparklers, and lighting snapdragons. (The latter two don't seem very useful for attracting survivors, but I guess it was fun. Shinobu sure does look cute in her yukata, too.) As night falls, one of their buckets of water falls over, and Shinobu and Koyomi both look up to see—the ending credits sequence!

Knowing what I do, this is probably grown-up Mayoi-chan. Either that or it's zombies, who send Koyomi and Shinobu off on a chase that leads them to grown-up Mayoi-chan. But it's probably Mayoi-san, because they're in the park where Koyomi first encountered Mayoi-chan. I wonder if Mayoi-san still wears twin tails. (Twenty-year-olds can wear twin tails too. I believe in encouraging everyone who wants to wear twin tails to do so, without discrimination by age. Except men. Please don't wear twin tails if you're a man. Although Edward Elric made a Tsubasa-like braid look pretty good.)

I guess we can assume that Hitagi and Koyomi still started going out in this reality, even if the circumstances were different from the original timeline. Otherwise Tsubasa wouldn't have the stress that led Black Hanekawa to recur. That's somewhat depressing; even in an alternate reality, poor Tsubasa doesn't have a chance. 

So far this story has been kind of lame in the anime just like it was in the novels, but at least it's shorter, and maybe Mayoi-san's appearance can make it worthwhile. Everyone on the Crunchyroll message boards was falling in love with Shinobu—some were even declaring changes of allegiance from Hitagi to Shinobu. She's cute enough, and I really like her voice, but let's not get ahead of ourselves here; if you're going to change your allegiance from Hitagi, you should change it to a better master, someone like...say...Tsukihi-chan!

##Thoughts on the finale of Mayoi Jiangshi and the first two parts of Nadeko Medusa, November 3rd, 2013:

Finally saw the end of Mayoi Jiangshi, and along with it the first two episodes of Otorimonogatari, which go far beyond what's been translated of the novel.

First, though, I want to complain about the use of review episodes. There were enough great moments cut from the Neko White episodes, and enough okay moments cut from the Mayoi Jiangshi episodes, that they could have filled in another episode without resorting to using review episodes. I wonder if it's some weird budgetary thing. They've got a review episode in between every arc. I've just been skipping them. I own Bakemonogatari and have an illegal fansub of Nekomonogatari Black, so I don't need to watch review episodes about what happened in them.

I kind of feel like the animators are taking advantage of the darker nature of the second season novels to cut out a lot of the fun pointless conversations and move the story along fast. That was somewhat necessary with Mayoi Jiangshi, because the novel just took way too long to go anywhere, but with Neko White and, I sort of suspect, with Nadeko Medusa, we are actually losing a lot of fun material with these cuts, even if none of it is strictly necessary to the plot. (Since when did Monogatari care about that?)

Anyway, it turns out that what knocked over the bucket was zombies after all. But Mayoi-san appears next to the map, where she was the first time Koyomi ever saw her, and drives them away by throwing rice at them. She's grown-up, hot, and wears a ponytail instead of twin tails, but she still wears her backpack (albeit less packed with stuff). She also carries a combat knife and wears army-style cargo pants, fitting to her life in the zombie apocalypse. It turns out that Oshino in this reality tracked her down and gave her a letter for Koyomi; Mayoi-san didn't even know if Koyomi existed, so she is surprised and pleased to encounter him and be able to give him the letter. In it, Oshino says that Shinobu in this reality failed at her suicide; she is still alive, but the servants became zombies because of a degeneration of her mental state. He explains that time travel in the Monogatari universe follows the "multiple branches" principle, so the original world where Mayoi-chan died is still out there, he and  Shinobu just have to find a way to get there. He also says that Koyomi ended up dating Hitagi in this world, asking who Koyomi dated in his original world (he doesn't seem to understand the significance of Mayoi-san, so maybe he thinks who Koyomi dated is the divergence point between the two worlds. Like maybe in the other world he dated Tsubasa, causing her stress to not build up).

Mayoi-san invites them over for tea at her house (which is Tsunade's former house nearby), but Koyomi says he and Shinobu have something to do and leave. They go to the shrine, and Shinobu summons current reality's Kissshot, who is decayed and burned after her attempt to burn herself to death. Shinobu tells Kissshot how things could have turned out differently if she had just spoken to Koyomi earlier instead of sulking for so long. Shinobu and Koyomi are expecting a hell of a fight, but Kissshot tells them to use her as a power source for their jump through time. Before she dies, she asks if Koyomi will rub her on the head. Koyomi does so, and Shinobu sucks her blood and uses the power to return them to their normal world, figuring that Mayoi-san and the others that she told them were still alive will rebuild that world now that the zombies are all gone.

They come out at the shrine and Koyomi wonders if they're really in the right world. He checks the day and time and realizes it's the next day and Tsubasa and Hitagi are going to kill him for not being at school. Shinobu goes back to sleep in his shadow.

Koyomi descends the stairs and is attacked by Mayoi-chan, who throws him around and tries to lick him like he usually does to her. Koyomi wonders if they landed in Bizarro world, but he knows it's right when Mayoi-chan says she left her backpack at his house and wanted to get it back before he looked inside. They walk together and talk for a while, and Koyomi asks if she regrets becoming a ghost and wishes she could come back to life, as Yotsugi was wondering earlier. Mayoi-chan says she doesn't wish she could come back—becoming a ghost was bad, she says, but she's glad she was able to meet him due to it happening. She asks if he would want to stop being a vampire, and he says no. They walk off together, chatting as always and enjoying the day.

I thought this ending was really sweet. I wanted to see some more of Mayoi-san, but otherwise, I liked the climactic scene with Shinobu and the concluding scene with Mayoi-chan. I'm also a little curious to know what happened to Tsubasa in the other timeline after she killed Koyomi—was she able to live with herself after doing such a thing? Did she lose her own identity and get absorbed into Black Hanekawa? 

I also thought it was interesting that it turns out Koyomi was gone at the beginning of Neko White because of this, and gone for the rest of it because of something else—presumably they got hold of him and sent him off to fight Ougi or whatever while he was out walking with Mayoi-chan, so that he was gone when Tsubasa wanted to talk to him at the entrance ceremony hanging out with Mayoi-chan, but the next day sent her and Hitagi a text message saying he was all right when Tsubasa was at Hitagi's house.

The first episode of Otori ends almost exactly where the translation of the novel ends. Nadeko reaches the shrine and is enlisted by Kuchinawa, using her guilt over the killing of the snakes and her fear of his huge scary form, to find his body. (Apparently he was the god worshiped at that shrine, but his shriveled corpse that was on the altar was somehow lost.)

In the second episode of Otori, Nadeko lies to Koyomi that nothing is wrong and cancels their meeting to discuss Kuchinawa. She and Kuchinawa strike a deal: during the day, Nadeko gets to do her usual thing, but at night, she'll look around town for his body. Kuchinawa bothers her by speaking up in class about how weird the situation is (no one else can hear him), and Nadeko invokes the agreement, asking him to can it. Her homeroom teacher speaks to her later and asks her to take care of her duties, both as class president and the special duties; Nadeko explains to Kuchinawa that she became class president by default because there were no nominations or volunteers due to the weirdness of the class; the teacher also asked her to do something about the class atmosphere since she's the only person unaffected by Kaiki's charms, but Nadeko can't do anything; as Kuchinawa says, it seems like that ought to be the teacher's job and is too much for one kid on the inside. 

That night, Nadeko goes out to look for the corpse. Kuchinawa thinks he has a hit in a sandbox, so Nadeko digs it up with a trowel, but finds nothing. Kuchinawa asks her to keep looking, but she refuses since she's tired and fills in the holes, then takes a minute to build a sand castle. While doing this, Koyomi runs up, relieved to have found her safe.

He brings her to his house and tells her what happened; Nadeko's parents discovered she was gone and called all her friends, including Tsukihi-chan (whose hair is in the Nise shaggy Dutch bob, which makes me confused about just when this story takes place—in the novel it sounded like it was after Neko White, so Tsukihi-chan should have her Fu Manchu braid). Tsukihi-chan (whose name I just like writing) was woken from a deep sleep and, figuring if it was Nadeko she couldn't be doing anything dangerous, told Nadeko's parents that Nadeko was at her house. Koyomi, who for unknown (probably nefarious) reasons was sneaking up on the sleeping Tsukihi-chan at that moment, heard and freaked out, running off to look for Nadeko.

Koyomi guesses that Nadeko was lying when she said the kai had gone away and that it had actually manipulated her into helping it look for something, causing her to go out at night. Nadeko insists that it's because of how she became the class president, and Koyomi says that if she ever needs to talk, she should come to him. He tells her to sleep over, giving her one of Tsukihi-chan's yukata; when she asks where, Koyomi says she can have the bed, and Nadeko says she's fine with under the bed; Koyomi says he can't make her sleep under the bed and says the bed is big enough for two when Shinobu springs up and knocks him unconscious by hitting him under the chin. (Wouldn't the most sensible thing be to have her sleep with Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan?)

Shinobu criticizes Nadeko's personality similar to what Hitagi said to Tsubasa earlier. She says Nadeko just gets by never being blamed or attacked because she's cute and apologizes a lot; people think she's smart and nice just because she's quiet, and she avoids being blamed when she doesn't manage to do a good job just because she's too cute to be mad at. Nadeko actually says she hates being treated like this and it's just another form of discrimination. Shinobu ends the conversation by saying she doesn't care and dragging Koyomi down to throw him on the sofa.

I just have to say it: Nadeko was really cute. I know, she just gets by with people not criticizing or blaming her when her arc isn't good or her commentary isn't funny just because she's cute. I demoted her pretty severely in my character rankings because she has so few good scenes compared with the others. But she's so cute. In any other show she would shoot straight to the top. And this episode felt more like what Monogatari should be than Mayoi Jiangshi: Nadeko had some "boke" moments that helped spice things up, such as when she asks Kuchinawa for a description of his body and he gives her nothing; she says it's as good as found in a chipper voice before realizing that there's no way she can find it with the utter lack of info he's given her. The final scene with Koyomi and Shinobu was really good, if depressingly short. (And anytime Tsukihi-chan shows up, it's a good thing; I have to thank Nadeko for that.) The fact that Shinobu specifically mentions the part about Nadeko's quietness making people think she's smart causes me to wonder if she was supposed to be smart originally, in Nadeko Snake, when the evidence for her intelligence appeared, and Nisio-san later decided to counteract that impression with the conversations in Mayoi Jiangshi and her grade listing at the beginning of Otori so that he could use it as part of this story. 

I hope nothing horrible happens to Nadeko at the end of this arc. If she goes through some suffering and has a revelation about herself like Tsubasa in Neko White, that's okay. If she graduates from her love for Koyomi and becomes popular and well-liked by restoring the atmosphere in her class, that's good; but if she just gets her heart broken and manages to realize she built Koyomi up into a superhuman, that's okay too. As long as nothing horrible happens. I demoted Nadeko just because she's a bit boring compared with the others, not because I dislike her; she's still cute and she still has Kana Hanazawa and "Renai Circulation".

Speaking of "Renai Circulation", the new opening, "Mousou Express", is probably my favorite of the second season so far. The sound reminds me of a mournful Brazilian blues kind of thing, with an ominous undertone. (I'm showing my extreme ignorance of music, I know.) The animation is a willful inversion of "Renai Circulation": the background is dark; Nadeko walks backwards at the beginning; instead of putting on her headband and working hard at her studies, she takes it off and snoozes at her desk after running off to mess around; and instead of longingly watching Koyomi from afar, she comes up and grabs him.

I also find the color palette in Otori very appealing. In general, everything is shaded the same deep scarlet as the background of "Mousou Express"; it's often dark, and scenes in the sunlight are very stark in their contrasts between light and shadow. It's interesting that they change the feel of the colors between stories like this; I think it's one of the more enjoyable aspects of the weird Shaft art style. 

I was very satisfied with the first two episodes of Otori, and I really liked the conclusion of Kabuki too. It is pretty insane how much material they cut—when Nadeko walks from her house to the park, the chapter changes, so that was an entire chapter in the novel. I still want to read it, though, but I'm glad they made an anime and arranged to have it simulcast like this so I can experience the story.

##Otori part 3, November 7th, 2013:

This might be the best episode yet of Monogatari: Second Season. That's a little unfair to the Neko White episodes since I had already read the novels and was comparing those episodes to the novel story the whole time, but that's how I felt about them.

This episode could have been called "Nadeko Unchained", or perhaps more accurately, "Nadeko Unbanged". I loved everything about it, but the first scene was the best, because it gave me what I've been wanting pretty much since Nadeko first appeared—a scene with Nadeko and Tsukihi-chan! I never thought it would happen. Thank the gods, Nisio-san—you do care about fans of Tsukihi-chan after all! Nadeko wakes up in Koyomi's bed held in an embrace by Tsukihi-chan, who wakes up and reacts in an over-the-top way, saying she thought she was embracing Oniichan. (By the way, they call each other "Nadeko-chan" and "Tsukihi-chan" to their faces, instead of "Sen-chan" and "Rara-chan".) After recovering from her shock and hearing Nadeko explain the situation, Tsukihi-chan starts talking about how cute Nadeko is (I forget why—I was focused on the adorableness of Tsukihi-chan herself at this point. Her hair is all messed up through the entire scene.) Tsukihi-chan says when she saw Nadeko on the first day of second grade she thought, "Ah, that girl is so cute! I have to be friends with her!" and Nadeko asks in a mumble if that means they wouldn't be friends if she weren't cute, thinking of Shinobu's speech from the previous night. Tsukihi-chan doesn't hear her properly and asks her to repeat; Nadeko gets scared and tries to use her usual tactics, but Tsukihi-chan doesn't let her. When she tries to apologize, Tsukihi-chan says she didn't ask if Nadeko was sorry, she asked her to repeat what she said. By being likewise imposing and nurturing, Tsukihi-chan manages to get Nadeko to voice her concerns and tell her about what Shinobu said last night. Tsukihi-chan says that must be why Nadeko always wears baggy and unstylish clothes and lets her hair grow out to hide her cute features and even wears that awful scrunchie around her wrist (which is actually Kuchinawa), and says what Shinobu said is silly and there's nothing wrong with being cute, but then she starts questioning Nadeko about Nadeko's feelings for Koyomi. Tsukihi-chan is confused by the fervor with which Nadeko holds these feelings after so long and such little acquaintance, especially since Nadeko already knows (as Tsukihi-chan has deduced) that Koyomi has a girlfriend. 

Nadeko reluctantly agrees to Tsukihi-chan's diagnosis that her love for Koyomi is like a love for an unattainable movie star or manga character. Tsukihi-chan says she thinks Nadeko is continuing this love because if she's in love with someone she can't have, it absolves her of responding to the confessions she receives or trying to work through a relationship. Nadeko doesn't admit it, but she knows this is true, later saying in her narration that she turned down a boy from one of the sports teams at the beginning of the year. When Nadeko says she doesn't intend to try and steal Koyomi and she doesn't want any trouble, Tsukihi-chan seems to get angry (though she remains quite calm) and says if Nadeko were going to steal Koyomi from Hitagi, Tsukihi-chan was thinking of cheering for her, but if Nadeko is going to hide behind her bangs like usual, she has to take some drastic measures. Tsukihi-chan gets a pair of scissors from the desk and suddenly, in one stroke, like a samurai, cuts off Nadeko's bangs.

Nadeko apparently has no memory of anything after that until she found herself in her uniform walking to school. She is traumatized by the loss of her bangs; Kuchinawa tells her he can grant her any wish she likes once they find his body, including regrowing her bangs. 

At school, Nadeko's teacher finds her and doesn't recognize her at first. He asks her how the assignment is going and Nadeko tries to get rid of him using her usual tactics of looking down until her interlocutor gets disgusted and leaves. It doesn't work, because he can now see her face so he knows how disturbed she is and becomes concerned instead of disgusted. At this point Nadeko snaps. She takes on some of Kuchinawa's speech patterns and starts calling herself "ore-sama", and screams at her teacher that she can't do anything about it and he shouldn't shove his duties off on her. The teacher says he just trusted her sense of duty and Nadeko shrieks that he shouldn't assume just because she's quiet that she has it all together. She stomps into her classroom and stands at the podium, yelling at her classmates and telling them that they're all idiots and they should be more resilient even if they discovered that everyone else is a self-serving hypocrite; she finishes by saying she hates them all, but dammit, they're her classmates, then kicks the podium into the middle of the room and stomps out. 

Kuchinawa explains that he didn't possess her or anything; she was expressing her own thoughts, using his voice. Nadeko says she knows, but it's still his fault. She says she wants to just find the object of worship and end her association with Kuchinawa, being much more forward and openly flippant than usual. Kuchinawa says it turns out the object is at Koyomi's house. 

Nadeko sneaks into the house and starts looking through Koyomi's things. She finds his porn stash and starts looking through it with interest, noticing that all the girls look like Tsubasa. (In the novel she would have known that for sure since she's met Tsubasa.) When Kuchinawa tries to talk to her, she tells him to shut up because the object might be hidden in the pages of the porn magazine she's now avidly reading. Kuchinawa tells her the bookmark that just fell out of the magazine is it. Somehow they turned Kuchinawa's body into a drawing and stored in on a talisman.

Kuchinawa says he can grant Nadeko any wish—no wish is too big. Nadeko refuses at first, but then asks if he could grant a wish for Koyomi to love her. The door suddenly opens, and Koyomi, standing in the doorway, says that's not possible.

Like I said, I totally loved this episode. Any episode where Tsukihi-chan appears is a good time. Nadeko's freakout scene went a little too long, but I enjoyed seeing her snap and admit that she's really not a good person after all. And the final scene was a lot of fun, especially seeing Nadeko looking through Koyomi's porn collection; it's like it was all written to counteract the earlier vision of Nadeko where she refused to acknowledge that Koyomi could have a porn collection. 

I had a hard time figuring out what Tsukihi-chan's angle was. At first she tells Nadeko that what Shinobu said is bogus, but then she seems to agree with it in some way. Maybe she disagreed with Shinobu's particular diagnosis of Nadeko's problems and offered her own diagnosis, according to her years of observation of Nadeko. In the end I think she was acting out of concern for Nadeko. She seemed almost motherly during the part where she refused to accept Nadeko's evasions or apologies (like her own mother, in fact, at least as far as we know from the one scene in Neko White). It seemed like she wanted to help Nadeko be happy—I also got this impression from one part where Tsukihi-chan tells Nadeko about people who buy lottery tickets and say they're buying dreams; Tsukihi-chan says rather than buy dreams, people should build a reality in front of them. I think she was telling Nadeko to just stop hiding one way or another and either really chase down Koyomi or give up on him; she decided to force things by cutting Nadeko's bangs after hearing that Nadeko had no intention of changing her approach at all or trying to take Koyomi from Hitagi. 

They were good together; Tsukihi-chan's maturity and Nadeko's childishness mixed interestingly. There  were yuri undertones to the scene too—Tsukihi-chan kept climbing up on Nadeko the way she does to Koyomi sometimes, and she was very vehement about Nadeko's cuteness. Maybe that's just how she gets with people she likes. (The yuri sisters scene with Karen-chan could be like the ultimate form of that—that's how she gets with people who are almost always with her, like one soul in two bodies.) Tsukihi-chan's messed up hair was adorable. Tsukihi-chan, Tsukihi-chan, Tsukihi-chan! I almost died from the cuteness. I wanted to die from the cuteness.

By the way, using the flashback structure was a genius storytelling move on Nisio-san's part; it prepared us for the idea of an evil Nadeko and made it so we could watch the slow buildup and not feel the story had gone off the rails when Nadeko finally snaps. (Does that make it all Tsukihi-chan's fault? No, Kuchinawa was manipulating her anyway; things were destined to go bad during the final confrontation with Koyomi after finding the object of worship.)

Like I said, I hope nothing terrible happens to Nadeko in the end. (Also, it would be nice if there was another scene with Tsukihi-chan.)

##The conclusion of Otori, November 14th, 2013:

I didn't get either of my wishes. There was no second scene with Tsukihi-chan, and while I'm not sure what happens to Nadeko at the end is terrible, it's not exactly a dream ending either. It is an extremely weird ending, and actually matches more closely what I thought was going to become of Tsubasa than of Nadeko.

It wasn't all Tsukihi-chan's fault, though.

Koyomi tries to talk Nadeko into putting back the talisman and ending this before something bad happens. Nadeko discovers that the scrunchie doesn't talk anymore, but still ignores him, especially after Shinobu insults her some more, and swallows the talisman, becoming a snake-haired monstrosity. She easily overcomes both Shinobu and Koyomi and goes to Kitashirahebi Shrine. Shinobu and Koyomi follow her, leading back around to the beginning. Nadeko asks in her narration if it was fun and we see that she once again trounced both Koyomi and Shinobu.

Kuchinawa explains that he was never really there to begin with; he was a delusion that Nadeko created to hide the truth of what she was doing from herself. Back in September, when she discovered that Koyomi had a girlfriend, she started going to the shrine every day to pray for him to dump his girlfriend and love her. Ougi, that day when she almost ran over Nadeko on the bicycle, told Nadeko that Koyomi was keeping an object of great power in his house that would let her do what she wanted. She also gave Nadeko the scrunchie to talk to so Nadeko could hide the truth behind hallucinations and delusions, also fueled by her visits to the shrine and her dim realizations that perhaps she ought to feel bad over what she did to those snakes. Nadeko purposely botched her sneaking out of the house so her parents would hear and call Tsukihi-chan, causing Koyomi to come after her and bring her to his house. While there, she stole a key and used it to sneak back into Koyomi's house and take the talisman. Using the power of the talisman, she resurrected a god that hadn't been there for hundreds of years and made it incarnate in herself, somewhat like what Tsubasa did with the Hindering Cat to create Black Hanekawa.

A few times during this explanation, Shinobu comes back to life and makes a snide remark, and Nadeko stabs her a few times with her snake spear to put her back down. Kuchinawa says that Nadeko is now a god and she can do whatever she wants. Nadeko says she's going to kill Koyomi; even if she just kills Hitagi, he'll end up with another girlfriend or lover, and since she only wants an unrequited love to keep her going, it's just as well—even better, maybe—if he's dead. She's also going to kill Shinobu and Hitagi.

At that moment she receives a call from Hitagi on her cell phone. Hitagi says she knows what's going on and asks if Koyomi is still alive. Nadeko says yes. Hitagi offers her life in return for Koyomi's and Shinobu's, but Nadeko says that's no good because she wants to kill them all, especially Shinobu who pissed her off. Hitagi offers a word of advice: Nadeko has to kill them in the order Hitagi, Shinobu, Koyomi. She has to kill Hitagi first because if Koyomi is dead and Hitagi is alive, Hitagi will kill everyone (her usual bluster, methinks). Shinobu has to die next because if Koyomi dies before her, she'll regain her full power and even Nadeko won't stand a chance against her. Then Koyomi dies.

During this advice, Nadeko becomes weirdly like her old self—good-natured and pliant and a bit submissive—so Hitagi asks for a favor in return for the advice. She asks Nadeko to delay the death for six months. After graduation, Hitagi says, the three of them will appear on the steps of Kitashirahebi Shrine and allow Nadeko to kill them, in order, as she wants. Nadeko agrees to this deal and lets Koyomi and Shinobu go. She says if she and Hitagi had met under different circumstances, they might have become friends, and Hitagi says that wouldn't have happened because she hates cute brats even more than her old self, and hangs up.

After the new ending, "Sono Koe wo Oboeteru" (new to Otori, anyway, not to this single episode), Nadeko tells us that the story doesn't really have an ending and it could have just ended with the line "Nadeko Sengoku became a god." Instead of an ending, Nadeko says, she'll give a preview. And she gives a preview in the style of her favorite terrible anime and sentai shows. We see Nadeko on the steps of the shrine tying her snake hair back into a ponytail, I guess so her bangs aren't in her face while she's killing everyone. She describes seeing Hitagi, Koyomi, and Shinobu come up on the steps and says maybe Suruga and Tsubasa could also appear, and then the whole cast would be assembled. (What about Mayoi-chan and Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan? How mean to not want to kill them too!) Nadeko says she'll begin the battle with a cool line as the last boss, and then she'll stick a spear in Hitagi's guts, lop off Shinobu's head, and then shove Koyomi head-down in the offerings box, and everything will be complete. She says it's "kami-ing soon".

I actually liked evil Nadeko. For one thing, I sympathized with her state where her life is falling apart and it's sort of her fault, but she's sort of just a victim of circumstances, but also it's her fault in a way because she, for whatever reason, ended up ill-equipped to handle real life. I feel like that right now. I didn't mind seeing Shinobu get stabbed for being mean to her either. I was afraid Hitagi was going to steal the ending from Nadeko but Nadeko was so crazy and over-the-top nuts by this time that not much could have accomplished that.

Otherwise, it was pretty confusing. There are annoying little things like how Hitagi knew what was going on and how she had Nadeko's cell phone number. I don't really know what the hell actually happened after Nadeko became a god. Was she somehow bound to the shrine and unable to leave? We know she doesn't kill everyone because Hana takes place after the graduation and everyone is alive. On the other hand, Hitagi does say "If you still want to kill us in six months...If you still feel a deep conviction to do that", and Nadeko reassumed her old personality somewhat while talking with Hitagi, so maybe we're to understand that she made the preview when she still felt the conviction to kill them and then later lost that conviction. 

Nadeko could have also left the shrine and continued her old life, albeit with a new view on things now that she's been unbanged (and become a god). When she was under the floor she didn't have the snake hair, so she can get rid of it. Tsukihi-chan is a kai living out there in the world with human parents and not hurting anyone, so it could have been the same for Nadeko. Maybe she gained a new strength from the incident and was able to turn her life around and be more assertive and less of a cute brat. If this didn't happen I'm curious how people like her parents and Tsukihi-chan reacted to her disappearance; I'd also like to know what Suruga thought, since Suruga liked Nadeko and was her friend.

I still feel like if Tsubasa had been around (or if Tsukihi-chan had known what was going on), none of this would have happened. Tsubasa went through almost the same things that Nadeko did—she let herself become a kai to escape her problems, which revolved around Koyomi and her unrequited love for him, and then later tried to kill him when it became clear she couldn't have him. Tsubasa was able to overcome this because of her intelligence and her friendship with Hitagi. I think Nadeko's statement that she and Hitagi could have been friends if they'd met under different circumstances might be an allusion to this—Tsubasa and Hitagi did meet under different circumstances, and were friends, which is why Tsubasa overcame her jealousy and took a turn for the positive. (Suruga did something similar when she became friends with Koyomi.) In the novels Nadeko talks about getting good advice from Tsubasa and then not taking it; if Tsubasa had actually been around to help her, it might have been different. I also think that Tsukihi-chan knows a lot about feelings and could have helped Nadeko if she'd known what was happening. She did actually try to help Nadeko by cutting off Nadeko's bangs so that Nadeko would have to face people and show her real self. Perhaps she thought it would help Nadeko have a pressure release valve, though Tsukihi-chan didn't know how much the girlfriend situation was bothering Nadeko because Nadeko lied that it didn't bother her. Come to think of it, even Suruga could possibly have been of some help since she went through it over Hitagi.

Even though I felt kind of sorry for Nadeko, I thought this confusing and somewhat annoying ending was actually very well-written. It's the sort of dark, ambiguous ending that I thought was in store for Tsubasa, and is another testament to the writing skill of Nisio-san. He was able to chronicle the turn to evil of a character that I thought could never be evil, and to make it exciting, and to make me enjoy it even though I was opposed to the idea when it first came up. Otori is 100% the best story of Second Season so far. (It could have been Neko White if I hadn't already read the novels though. Oh well, it's not fair.) This actually made me like Nadeko again, much more than I was expecting, especially her preview of killing everyone. I found it amusing that she says insane things and then talks about how insane they are, too. With this we also get unambiguous proof that Ougi is evil and up to no good, since she's the one who manipulated Nadeko into doing all of this. 

There's another review, and then Shinobu Time starts. It takes place right after Mayoi Jiangshi (literally minutes after the ending credits of Mayoi Jiangshi). I'm a little concerned because there are only ten episodes left and three stories. If we do four per story like we have been, that doesn't leave enough time. I hope Suruga Devil doesn't get shafted; I like Suruga and I want to see her story done well. I wonder if they're going to do an anime of the third season. That's the only way I'll ever know what happens, so I hope so.

##Koimonogatari, 11/16/2013:

I guess that's the best heading to put this under, although it actually pertains to Otori as well.

After I wrote about the ending of Otori I began to suspect that Hitagi End might somehow concern how Koyomi, Shinobu, and Hitagi had evaded death at Nadeko's hands on the day of Koyomi and Hitagi's graduation. That's because I knew from reading Hana that her preview had to be an illusion, and I remembered that Hitagi told Kaiki at the beginning of Koi that she wanted him to trick someone. I confirmed it by reading a chapter of Koi today; Hitagi meets with Kaiki and tells him he needs to indemnify someone, who is not her. Kaiki next thinks of Karen-chan, saying in his narration that he actually liked Karen-chan because of the strength of her character to be ordering him around right after they met, and is interested if it involves her. But Hitagi tells him it's not Karen-chan; it's Sengoku Nadeko, a name he's never heard before. (Since he just sold the charm to her attackers and never met her or heard anything about her.)

Once again, I hope that nothing horrible happens to Nadeko in the end, now that I know the end of Otori isn't the end of Nadeko's involvement in the story. Kaiki is a fraudster, but maybe he can somehow unmake her a god since he does have some real powers. (Maybe he'll be taken in by her cuteness. Nah, he doesn't seem the type. Maybe he'll get taken in by her evilness. That seems more likely. Although even evil, Nadeko is the type who is easily tricked and manipulated.) But with this, she really is the last boss; I wonder if Nisio-san was planning this ever since he had Suruga call her that in Karen Bee, or if the idea just came to him later as a confluence of that and Kana Hanazawa's desire to play an evil character. Either way, it came out to some damn good storytelling. I kind of hope Tsubasa or Tsukihi-chan can also play a role in the action here.

I forgot to mention that during Nadeko's crazed freak-out when she realizes she's a god now, she starts calling herself "watashi" instead of "Nadeko." (At least she didn't feel the need to go for Kuchinawa's "ore-sama" though.)

##Shinobu Time part 1, November 27th, 2013:

Can you believe all the "kami" puns in Otori? We have Nadeko, who uses her "kami" (hair) as a shield, find a piece of "kami" that turns her into a "kami" who tells us about the death of Hitagi, Shinobu, and Koyomi (in that order), "kami-ing" soon.

It looks like they're doing Hitagi End first, right after Shinobu Time, and then possibly doing Suruga Devil. Glancing over the series timeline on Baka-Tsuki (I didn't read any spoilers), it seems like Suruga Devil is a pretty short story, so they might be able to fit it all into just two episodes. I assume they decided to do this because Hitagi End relates how Koyomi, Hitagi, and Shinobu evaded death at the hands of Nadeko with Kaiki's help, so it would lack suspense if you already knew they would succeed because you had already seen Suruga Devil. (Actually, Shinobu might die. That would pretty much end the series, since she began the series by turning Koyomi into her subordinate. She wanted to die originally, and if she did, Koyomi would become human. That would really create the "Hitagi end" because no one, even Shinobu, would be there to be between Hitagi and Koyomi, with Nadeko definitely out of the running (who leaves his girlfriend to shack up with a crazy girl who tried to kill him so she could have an eternal unrequited love?), Suruga still a lesbian, Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan still his sisters, Mayoi-chan passed on, and Tsubasa definitively rejected.

The thought of Hitagi's final victory still makes me sort of sad. What ever happened to the "total victory" that Tsubasa said Koyomi's relationship with Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan was approaching in the novel of Tsubasa Tiger? Well, anyway, it's time to talk about time. Shinobu Time! (Is that like "Island time" or more like "Miller time"?) The first episode begins with Koyomi and Mayoi-chan on their way to Koyomi's house to pick up Mayoi-chan's backpack after the ending credits of Kabukimonogatari. They talk a little about what happened and how Mayoi-chan never wanted to be revived, so Koyomi did something unnecessary. Koyomi mentions how Mayoi-chan seems different somehow without her backpack, more of a slug than a snail. They talk about how you really can't just pull the shell off a snail to get a slug, because the snail will die, and Koyomi says this is like Mayoi-chan's backpack, but Mayoi-chan says nothing in that backpack is really that important to her and she just hates the idea of Koyomi having her things. She wants to get it back so that she doesn't become Mayoi Namekuji (slug), but that's about it. 

At Koyomi's house, Mayoi-chan suddenly becomes imperious and tells Koyomi she's not going to put herself at risk by going into his room when no one else is home and he has five seconds to get her backpack down to her. Koyomi somehow manages it, and Mayoi-chan says some more mean stuff. Koyomi asks if there's anything she wants to eat and Mayoi-chan says yes, but people will stare at him if he eats with her, like those people who order a meal for their departed daughter and sit with it across from them. Koyomi says he doesn't care (that's actually pretty sweet of him) and asks her to get on the back of his bicycle, but she refuses to ride with him. Just as she's about to make another one of the "I hate Araragi" replies that Koyomi is coming to enjoy, a terrible, indescribable dark thing appears.

Mayoi-chan sees reason and gets on the bicycle (it has a rack for holding packages and stuff), and Koyomi rides as fast as he can to get away from the terrible dark thing, whose eldritch presence is so horrifying that they can't even stand to be near it. The dark thing chases them, and Koyomi tells Mayoi-chan to hold tight on him and starts enjoying the feeling. He tells her to dig her breasts into his back, bite his shirt, and hold on like she's going to fuse with him; in her fear, Mayoi-chan does, and Koyomi enjoys the feeling (though we know that Mayoi-chan also enjoys this stuff, she just pretends not to). The dark thing attacks and hits Mayoi-chan, but only manages to knock out one of her twin tails and tear the shoulder of her shirt. Mayoi-chan describes the damage to Koyomi and he says it's good she's not hurt, but now it looks like he attacked her and is kidnapping her. The dark thing lays a trap for them at one of the intersections and almost gets them, but Yotsugi suddenly appears and saves them by jumping a million miles into the air. (Mayoi-chan passes out during the shuffle, and when Koyomi collects her for jumping, he first looks under her skirt, in case there's a kai hiding there.)

They go to the abandoned cram school (which is destined to burn down a few days later after Tsubasa gets jealous of his meeting with Suruga there), where Koyomi is disappointed because Yotsugi isn't the character who's going to appear, save them, and explain everything. Also, Koyomi is naked because he took off all his clothes except his boxers to lay over the still-unconscious Mayoi-chan. (He could have just taken off his jacket, but I guess he wanted to be naked around Mayoi-chan.) Yotsugi comments (fixates) on how impressive his muscles are many times. When she says she really doesn't know anything about the dark thing, Koyomi says he'll just wait and have Shinobu eat it, and then have Tsubasa explain it to him (who he introduces to Yotsugi as "someone who knows everything"). Yotsugi makes a disparaging remark about old grandmas and says she doesn't really think it's good to be so dependent on other people.

Koyomi says he'll repay Yotsugi some day, but Yotsugi, after asking if he'll repay her with muscles, says since she might not be there before long, there's no "some day" for her and all debts are payable immediately. Koyomi says he doesn't know what he can do and Yotsugi suddenly kisses him, then says she's going back to work. (Recall that she was hired, along with Episode, by Izuko the hip-hop reject from the early 1990s, to do something.)

With Yotsugi gone, the ending credits play (Sono Koe wo Oboeteru with new adorable animation where Mayoi-chan and Shinobu are rolling around together on the bed, and claymation Mayoi-chan occupies the background) and then Koyomi realizes that he's completely alone with an unconscious Mayoi-chan and goes to attack her, but is stopped by Shinobu. Shinobu knows it all and is mad that he kissed Yotsugi in the presence of his eternal life partner, her, and Koyomi kisses her to shut her up. (The way Shinobu talks about their relationship here is what makes me think that her death might be necessary for Hitagi End to really be the Hitagi end. Also, Koyomi being human might be helpful for that. By the way, if this were really a visual novel, there would be the Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan ends too, and I wouldn't feel so cheated by paying for a lousy game that doesn't even have an end for my favorite character, Tsukihi-chan, or my second-favorite, Karen-chan. Every visual novel worth its salt has the incest ending.)  After overcoming her shock, Shinobu explains that the darkness isn't a kai and it's something she faced 400 years ago when she made her first subordinate. 

This episode wasn't quite as good as Otori, but I still really liked it. Mayoi-chan was totally robbed in Kabuki, so here she gets some back. (I heard somewhere that while Mayoi Jiangshi is actually all about Shinobu, Shinobu Time is actually all about Mayoi-chan.) Mayoi-chan is my fourth favorite, and there have been times I've thought about promoting her above Tsubasa or even Karen-chan, because she gets some of the best dialogue in the series and is so damned adorable. It was pretty sweet when Koyomi offered to buy her lunch, even though that would mean sitting there by himself with another meal across from him like a grieving mother. Nisio-san really likes to write about weird, obnoxious characters, so Koyomi is sort of an anomaly for him as a hero, but Koyomi still has his moments, and most of them are connected to Mayoi-chan, and the rest to Tsubasa. (And unlike the moments in Neko Black, it can't be explained away as Koyomi doing good while pretending to be bad to protect himself.) But since Koyomi really isn't the sort of amoral person that Ii-chan (or even a bunch of the Medaka Box characters) are, he pretty much always does something nice to make up for it, eventually.

The commenters on Crunchyroll continued the Shinobu love train, but I don't quite see it. She's cute, sure, but come on. This is Monogatari. There are way cooler characters than a blonde loli vampire who makes witty retorts. She's not even the best in breed of blonde loli vampires (for me, that would be Eva-chan). At least I can understand why people love Hitagi and Suruga so much, even if I don't love them as much as other people do. For me, Shinobu has never, never, never had one of those absolutely awesome killer scenes that a real Monogatari heroine needs to have (cf. Hitagi's confession in the park or insults while naked at her apartment; Mayoi-chan's "the courage to" scene; Suruga's card game with Koyomi or her Schroedinger's panties joke during the commentary; Nadeko's board game seduction or her battle of obscure anime references with Koyomi outside the school gates; Tsubasa's Tsubasa Tiger (yes, every single bit of it) or her scene where she tells Koyomi she'll do anything; Karen-chan's toothbrushing scene; or Tsukihi-chan's love consultation, scene with Koyomi after the bath, or scene with Nadeko in Otori. I just love reliving my favorite scenes over and over again. Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan aren't quite official heroines either, but they're like the secret hidden bonus heroines, and they definitely have all the prerequisites as far as scenes go). For me, Mayoi-chan is the real attraction of this story. I hope to see some nice Mayoi-chan moments as we go forward. Despite Koyomi's perversion towards her, his relationship with Mayoi-chan is actually the sweetest in the series, I think. (Nadeko was a contender before she went insane.) Mayoi-chan is just a dead kid who meant nothing to Koyomi; she was even a kai who haunted him, for a little while. But he talks to her, plays with her, takes her out to eat, invites her to his house, and introduces her to his other abuse victim (Tsubasa) even though he's afraid they might team up and form a league against him. (If you think about it like that, he deserves Hitagi, who is abusive towards him, as retribution for his abuse of Tsubasa and Mayoi-chan.) That's probably why Mayoi-chan doesn't have any desire to come back to life: because she never had a friend like him when she was alive.

I heard that Mayoi-chan disappears at the end of this arc, so I hope we can get a really nice farewell from her like we did from Tsubasa.

##Thoughts on the remainder of Shinobu Time, December 20th, 2013:

We totally got the nice farewell I wanted for Mayoi-chan. 

I loved this story.

It had a few weird plot holes and stuff, but the final scene with Mayoi-chan was so cute that I pretty much ignored those.

In Part 2, Shinobu explains the circumstances under which she made her first minion hundreds of years ago. She had gone to Antarctica to see the aurora borealis, but since there were no humans there, her existence was weakening, so she took a gigantic leap and landed in a lake in the middle of Japan. This happened to splash most of the water in the sky, causing it to fall as rain and water the crops of a drought-stricken village. The villagers began to worship Shinobu as a god, and Shinobu, lazy and bored, decided to let them.

Eventually she met a young samurai armed with the Kokorowatari, whose mission was to exterminate evil kai. She teamed up with him to investigate the disappearance of the villagers, who were being sucked up by a horrible darkness. She and he encountered the darkness and were nearly swallowed; Shinobu lost her legs, but just before she did, she was able to make another leap, clutching the hand of the young samurai all the while, and bring herself back to Antarctica.

Shinobu finally broke down and resumed being a vampire, stopped being a god, and sucked the blood from the hand. This brought the samurai back to life, but he was not grateful; he despised her, and they spent several weeks fighting in the frozen wasteland, until he killed himself. Shinobu explains that the darkness is no kai; it's some sort of unknown force that can't be eaten or killed by Kokorowatari (actually the replica of it that Shinobu made with her matter-creation powers).

This episode was necessary, but it was pretty boring. It was slightly livened up by the nice picture book ukiyo-e drawings that unfold from right to left across the screen, like a scroll unrolling. I also initially thought it didn't really shed any light on the darkness (so to speak), but the way this episode tied the story together at the end was very clever; just like the end of Mayoi Snail, it was one of my favorite surprise endings in the entire Monogatari series.

In Part 3, Yotsugi returns and reveals that she was outside listening the whole time. She and Shinobu fight, then torture Koyomi once he realizes that he's alone with three lolis (his type) by making him say which one is his favorite (I think his real favorite is Mayoi-chan—even more so after the ending of this story—but he makes the correct diplomatic decision by saying Shinobu, given that Mayoi-chan is asleep and Shinobu is the one he has to live with for the foreseeable future. Shinobu then tries to make him say who he likes better from her, Hitagi, and Tsubasa, but Koyomi manages to sidestep this.

When Mayoi-chan wakes up, Koyomi goes up to the roof to toss her around and hug her and squeeze her and call her George and look at her panties. Mayoi-chan sincerely thanks Koyomi for helping her escape and for thinking of her feelings when he stopped at the red light, even though she says he didn't have to under the circumstances. When Yotsugi and Shinobu fight, Mayoi-chan whips them into shape as the loli commander, but then Shinobu gets mad and she and Mayoi-chan fight while Yotsugi tells Koyomi that she knows Izuko Gaen can explain what the darkness is since Izuko knows everything. (Shinobu must like Mayoi-chan, though—she saved her from being molested by Koyomi on several occasions. Or maybe she was just jealous. She does seem to get jealous of Koyomi's other lovers, and somehow he's never shown any interest in her aside from a few jokes in Mayoi Jiangshi.)

The darkness begins to form again, and Yotsugi jumps away with all of them, Shinobu inside Koyomi's shadow. They arrive at a picturesque waterfall, where Koyomi wakes up to be told that he's been asleep for twelve hours. (By Yotsugi.) Mayoi-chan is asleep right now, but she and Yotsugi took the opportunity to draw on his stomach with markers while he was asleep. Yotsugi is concerned because Shinobu hasn't come out, even though it's night. She's wondering if Shinobu is being spiteful towards her, but Koyomi says Shinobu isn't like that and he thinks she's not there. He tells Yotsugi he has to kiss her to get Shinobu jealous so she'll come out. Mayoi-chan intercedes and Koyomi asks if she's jealous. They determine, however, that Shinobu is really not there after all. The darkness probably grabbed her and yanked her out of the shadow, somehow severing her connection to Koyomi. Since Koyomi's immortality is now weakened, he can't survive one of Yotsugi's big jumps, so they have to leave the mountains where they now are the old-fashioned way. Somewhere around here, Part 3 ends and Part 4 begins.

They find somewhere with a tiny pocket of cell phone reception and Koyomi sends a text to Yozuru, asking for her help. He also sends texts to Hitagi, Tsubasa, Karen-chan, and Tsukihi-chan (misspelled, as Mayoi-chan points out only after he's already sent them). This is the text that Hitagi and Tsubasa received at Hitagi's apartment the evening of the second day of Neko White.

Koyomi carries Mayoi-chan for a way until they reach some houses, and Yotsugi suggests going in one to ask for a landline phone. They knock on a door and are answered by Izuko, looking just as 90s hip-hop reject as ever. 

Izuko explains that she knew something was wrong because the job she hired Yotsugi for wasn't going anywhere (Yotsugi explained earlier that she was ditching work because the situation seemed to require it.) She says she'll help them by explaining what's going on, but Koyomi has to do three favors for her. He agrees without even hearing them, saying there's really no choice in the matter, and Izuko enumerates them. She's Suruga's aunt, she says, and she wants to be introduced to Suruga—but not as an aunt. She wants Koyomi to persuade Suruga to help her with the job that Yotsugi is assigned to, and she wants Koyomi to help Suruga. (However, she says if Suruga refuses, she'll be bound by that decision, but she'll still take Koyomi's help. This makes it seem like Suruga is like the Gaen princess or something.)

Izuko explains that the darkness isn't after Shinobu—it's after Mayoi-chan. She says it's something that exists to dispose of kai who stop acting kai-like. It came after Shinobu because she had stopped acting like a vampire and started acting like a god; it never chased her after her big leap because she gave in and made a minion, doing something vampire-like. It's after Mayoi-chan now because she's supposedly a lost cow, but she's not doing anything lost cow-like, such as getting people lost. The darkness stopped chasing them whenever Mayoi-chan was asleep, and it hasn't come after them now because they're wandering aimlessly in the mountains, so they sort of are lost. (Before beginning this explanation Izuko yells at Mayoi-chan to stop pretending to be asleep, and Mayoi-chan runs to Koyomi and adorably seeks refuge in his arms.)

Izuko leaves and they ponder their options. Yotsugi stays with them, saying it feels like she's lost with them, so leaving doesn't seem right. Mayoi-chan refuses to start making people lost again and says she's okay with disappearing into the afterlife and no longer being a ghost of a ghost (as Izuko put it, saying the world can't tolerate such a weird metastructure and so sent the darkness after her). Koyomi resists, saying there must be something else they can do, and tells Mayoi-chan she can't just take the whole thing on herself. Mayoi-chan asks if that isn't what Koyomi's been doing the whole time anyway. Koyomi says he never did it so cheerfully and asks Mayoi-chan to stop smiling and saying she's all right with it. Mayoi-chan says if he really wants to stop the whole town from being swallowed by the darkness, including Hitagi and Tsubasa and Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan, he needs to let go of her hand (he's been sitting next to her and holding her hand the whole time). Yotsugi joins in and says if the person involved is fine with it, he should respect her wishes, and it's hard to tell who the real child is. Koyomi's last idea is that he'll stay lost with her forever, or at least for another twenty years or so until he stops being a vampire (as his connection with Shinobu grows weaker and weaker). Mayoi-chan puts that down by saying it isn't fair to the others she mentioned to give her twenty years while they're waiting for him. She says she owes him everything—without him she never would have found her mother's house, and she enjoyed their conversations and never thought it was going to be able to go on forever. She says it was like an omake, or a bonus round, or extra innings, or a DVD extra, for her. 

Koyomi goes to the edge of the little bridge they're on to look at the pond (they're in a Buddhist temple, it looks like), and Mayoi-chan asks if they can do their little routine, where she says "Shitsurei, kamimashita". Koyomi says that must mean she was doing it on purpose the whole time, and Mayoi-chan says of course, no one could flub it that many times. Koyomi hears her coming closer and turns around, only to have her suddenly kiss him. The camera pulls out to show that she's riding on Yotsugi's shoulders so she could reach high enough to surprise-kiss him. In tears, Mayoi-chan says "Shitsurei. Kamimashita", then tells Koyomi that she loves him. (Using daisuki.)

Four months later, Koyomi is sitting in the classroom telling Ougi the story of what happened. He says that after that, Mayoi-chan disappeared, and he, Yotsugi, and Suruga completed Izuko's assignment (which, as we saw, led to the cram school burning down, and later led him to burst into his house after getting Tsubasa's text and find her letter, then come to her rescue). Ougi leaves to do some "work" (this seems to be after Otori, because Kabuki was in late August, and Otori was on Halloween, so four months would put this scene sometime in December, about a month after Otori). Koyomi tells Shinobu that he's figured out Ougi is up to something and he told her that story just to see what would happen, but he wants to keep it quiet that Mayoi-chan is no longer around, so that he can have one up on Ougi in some shadowy battle they're undertaking.

Mayoi-chan's final scene almost made me cry. It was unspeakably adorable. Like Neko White, this was a satisfying ending for the plot arc of one of my favorite characters. On the heels of the surpassingly good Otori, this was another incredible story that showed us that sweetness does still exist in the Monogatari world, even if Nadeko is no longer its paragon. I can't say enough about how adorable this ending was and how much I loved the final scene, with Koyomi desperately trying to hang on to one of his best friends even after she herself has accepted that it's over, so I won't try. (But this does back up my belief that Mayoi-chan is his favorite loli.)

They're doing Suruga Devil as a separated block of episodes, so the last four episodes are Hitagi End. I'm actually looking forward to that story now. For one thing, Hitagi wasn't really in the rest of this series, other than her very good scenes in Neko White, so I didn't have to feel like she was hogging the spotlight. (Though I'll never quite forgive her for hogging the spotlight from poor Karen-chan, who barely gets any screentime anyway). I also like her new personality more than her old one (though I'm pretty much the only one, I think). And the whole story was extremely well set up from Otori. Also, I like Kaiki, even if he's an evil bastard who tried to get Tsukihi-chan killed. I didn't read any spoilers, but I do know that one of the episodes has some weird duet of Hitagi and Kaiki as its opening, so that ought to be awesome. If it's even half as good as Shinobu Time (which is probably my new favorite story of the anime, though Otori was also incredible and Neko White was the best of the novel versions), I'll be good with that.

I also heard they were doing anime versions of the third season books (which seem not to have any of the original heroines). I didn't mind Yotsugi so much after Shinobu Time, so it's okay if they do a story about her, but I think it's fair of me to have the mindset that, given how many awesome characters there are in this series, if you want to introduce another one, you really have to tell me why I should care. Fortunately that has been done with both the characters I complained about (Ougi is an evil villain who made Nadeko go crazy, and Yotsugi is actually a big softie who ditched her work to help Koyomi and Mayoi-chan and then was nice enough to prop up Mayoi-chan so she could surprise-kiss Koyomi). Besides, at this point I guess I shouldn't doubt Nisio-san, who recovered after the somewhat lame Kabukimonogatari to give us two stories filled with greatness (but sadly lacking in Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan, except for that one awesome scene in Otori where Tsukihi-chan unbanged Nadeko). So yeah, this is still my favorite show ever.

##Thoughts on Hitagi End Part 1, December 26th, 2013:

I spent Christmas Evening down at the community center watching anime. How terrible, right? The exact opposite of Hitagi End Part 1, by the way—it was awesome.

Most of this episode I had already read in the novels, but there were some details I missed or had forgotten that made what could have been a boring episode of exposition and setup into an awesome episode exposition and setup. Yes, the story doesn't advance much; we all could have guessed that Kaiki would somehow end up accepting the job even though we knew he wouldn't be swayed by guilt and wouldn't particularly want to help Hitagi or Koyomi. But watching the verbal duel between Kaiki and Hitagi is pretty fun, and given how weirdly similar their personalities are, I kind of believe that Hitagi might have had a crush on him at one point.

Like the novel, the episode begins with Kaiki talking about his deceptive nature and how much he loves money. While at a shrine on New Year's Day watching with horror as people throw money away (supposedly), he receives a call from Hitagi. He claims to be not Kaiki but Suzuki, and even gives his usual kanji-explaining introduction that Koyomi got in Karen Bee, except for his new fake name. Hitagi says that's fine, then she's not Senjogahara, she's "Senshogahara". Kaiki claims he's in Okinawa at a cafe, so Hitagi runs out the door to fly to Okinawa, forcing Kaiki to also fly down to Okinawa. Since his plane comes in about the same time that hers does, Kaiki says he came to the airport to pick her up and wants to meet her in the lobby. Hitagi says she'll be in a cafe wearing some glasses so he knows who she is. 

Kaiki catches sight of her through the window wearing some Groucho Marx glasses with a beard and mustache attached. For some reason he takes this as a challenge and goes into a shop to buy some yellow sunglasses and a really loud Hawaiian shirt; when he sits down across from Hitagi and sees a tiny shock cross her face, he thinks "I win."

Hitagi tells him essentially what happened in Otori and the situation she's facing now with respect to being killed by Nadeko, now a god. Kaiki asks why she doesn't ask Oshino, and Hitagi says she can't find him; Tsubasa even went overseas to look for him, but hasn't come back yet. (I'm wondering if Tsubasa's overseas trip in Otori was for this too; at that point Koyomi must have known of the evil of Ougi since Shinobu Time had already happened and Koyomi had already done the job for Izuko along with Suruga. So maybe Tsubasa went overseas to look for Oshino in regard to that, and gained another reason to find him after the events of Otori.) Kaiki for some reason is intrigued by the name Tsubasa Hanekawa and asks Hitagi who she is; Hitagi says she's a mutual friend of her and Koyomi and adds "She has big boobs" for some reason.

Kaiki asks why he should do this job and Hitagi tries the guilt trip on him, knowing it won't work. She also tries the "What are you, chicken?" routine by asking if he thinks his deception skills are up to fooling a god, but Kaiki doesn't bite and says tricking a god is well within his skill level, but he needs to see some money. Hitagi says she can give him a down payment of 100,000 yen, the same amount Oshino received for helping her (though I got the feeling he just took it to make her feel better, because he helped everyone else in return for little chores and barters, so it doesn't seem like he cares much about money). Kaiki says it's nowhere near enough and Hitagi asks what amount he would take for doing the job. Kaiki gets evasive for some reason and won't tell her.

Several times during the conversation when Kaiki said something evil, Hitagi threw her glass of orange juice in his face; every time, Kaiki called the waitress and said it was an accident, then ordered another glass of orange juice. When Hitagi finally says she'll sell her body to get the money to pay him whatever he asks, Kaiki throws his cup of coffee in her face and leaves for the bathroom. (It was hot when he ordered it, but it must have cooled down because Hitagi isn't horrifically burned by it.)

While in the bathroom, Kaiki grips his face in front of the mirror and goes through a monologue of all the possible reasons to accept Hitagi's job. It's a no on wanting to help worthy rivals; he'd be happy if they were killed. It's a no on guilt over Nadeko, and also on guilt over Karen-chan, or Tsukihi-chan (it turns out he wasn't just being petty and vengeful; Yozuru paid him for the info. So he was being greedy, petty, and vengeful.) It's a no on being touched by Tsubasa's actions or the possibility that her family has money (he's greedy, but not stupid). Finally he comes to the fact that Koyomi and Hitagi both know Suruga, the niece of his sempai Izuko from the occult club back in college. Kaiki rolls it all over in his mind and determines that it's a yes.

Seeing their weird conversation while wearing Groucho glasses and a horrible Hawaiian tourist outfit made even the recap of events from Otori more interesting, and once they got into the negotiations, it was all awesome. Hitagi gained ten points to Hitagidor in my book just for her introduction of Tsubasa where she threw "She has big boobs" on the end for no reason. She also describes Shinobu (when she told Kaiki that Shinobu was also in on this deal) as Koyomi's blonde loli-slave. Kaiki says he doesn't care if Koyomi has five more loli-slaves, he could deceive Nadeko and save them all for the right price.  That was another good line from Hitagi.

I already liked Kaiki, but he also became even more great when he tried to one-up Hitagi in a stupid way by buying the Hawaiian outfit. (I'm sure he knew he wasn't fooling her with his claim to have been in Okinawa the whole time; she even said when he "came to meet her in the airport" something like "Oh, I thought you just said that to cover up the fact that your plane also just landed and you were already in the airport.") The Groucho glasses and Hawaiian shirt kept changing throughout the entire conversation, too, in the usual weird Shaft style.

I was intrigued by what we see about Kaiki in this episode. I think we have to believe him when he says he lies about everything and consider that he's lying about how amoral and evil he is. For one thing, he actually went to meet Hitagi, even though he really had no reason to. (I know he wasn't afraid she would kill him like she claimed; of all people in this series, Kaiki knows more than anyone that Hitagi can't kill anyone. The only reason she isn't cat food already is that Koyomi and Tsubasa are looking out for her.) He heard her out for some reason, and seemed weirdly interested in details like Tsubasa. (I'm wondering if he knows something we don't about her overseas adventure. Or possibly he heard something about her exploits in previous stories.)  He threw coffee in Hitagi's face when she talked about selling her body; you'd think Kaiki would regard that as admirable, since he believes that money is worth more than most people's lives (as he says in the first scene of the episode). But apparently he doesn't think so; for whatever reason, he thinks it's worthy of coffee in the face. Then there's his bathroom monologue. 

I think there's only one conclusion to draw from that monologue: Kaiki wanted to take the job from the beginning. Or at least, from early on, long before he actually brought money into the conversation. He brought in money, I guess, because it was expected of him, and maybe also because he wanted to see what he could get out of it, since Hitagi didn't know he was going to do it anyway. I don't know if it's because he knew that Suruga was a friend of Hitagi and Koyomi already (he did meet Koyomi coming out of Suruga's, and heard from Koyomi that he was a friend of Suruga's) or if it was something else. During his monologue he says it's not because Hitagi talked about selling her body, but perhaps that was the point where he realized it was getting stupid and Hitagi was getting desperate, and it was time to stop screwing around and tell her something. 

Anyway, I think having Kaiki around as a foil will help keep Hitagi from getting too annoying, and maybe I will like her again. I already like her a lot more than I did last year at this time. She looks cute with short hair, too. I liked Tsubasa better with long hair, but it looks good on Hitagi. She looks less gloomy and sickly. I'm also really looking forward to seeing how Kaiki tricks Nadeko into not killing them.

##Hitagi End Part 2, December 31st, 2013:

I spent this afternoon watching Hitagi End Part 2, which just ramped up on the awesomeness of Part 1. Not only do we get more great scenes between Hitagi and Kaiki, we also get some plot advancement, including a surprisingly great scene between Kaiki and Nadeko—yes, those two in a scene together. It was great. It might have actually been one of my favorite scenes in the series (Mayoi-chan's final scene is probably the best, though).

Kaiki returns from the bathroom and tells Hitagi he'll take the job. Hitagi asks if he's insane, and Kaiki says it's possible they've all gone insane already in this world where she's coming to ask him for help. Kaiki takes the 100,000 yen Hitagi was offering him, saying it's not even a down payment and is just his operating expenses; he says if he told her the amount he'd really need to take a job like this, even selling herself wouldn't be enough to cover it.

Kaiki asks Hitagi for more information about Nadeko, such as whether there's a chance she'll go back on her word and kill them all before the time comes. Hitagi says she doesn't think that will happen because Nadeko is already as angry as she'll ever be, so her anger can only cool down and make it less likely that she'll kill them before the deadline. Kaiki asks what made Nadeko so angry that she wanted to kill them, and Hitagi says she doesn't really know, but then admits that it had to do with Nadeko being in love with Koyomi and then discovering he had a girlfriend. Kaiki is disappointed that it's such a lowbrow tale.

The two of them apparently go to the aquarium together to discuss how things will play out, and Kaiki asks if this means he can come to their town again. Hitagi says yes, as long as he's working for them he can do whatever he needs to, but she asks that he avoid being seen by Koyomi or anyone else she knows, because then he might be pounded into a pulp by a middle school girl and dragged off for a torture session. Kaiki wishes to avoid such an unpleasant fate, so he agrees. He also agrees with Hitagi that Koyomi must never know she sought his help. Kaiki asks if Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan know about this, and Hitagi says the only people who know are the principals and Tsubasa, who figured it out on her own. Kaiki wonders just who the heck this Hanekawa person is (I thought Hitagi made it pretty clear: she's a friend of hers who has big boobs.)

Kaiki says he's flying into their town tonight, and that he and Hitagi should take separate flights since he doesn't know what terrible things might happen if Koyomi ever finds out that he and Hitagi were on the same flight. Hitagi agrees, then asks if she can borrow some money to pay for a flight. (I loved the way she asked this; although you could tell she was just a bit ashamed, she was also brazen about it, just saying in her normal deadpan voice "I need to borrow some money".)

Kaiki spends his flight drawing little doodles of the people involved that look oddly like the preview cards for Nisemonogatari. We get to hear his awesome theme another time, and he lands and contacts Hitagi. Kaiki has concluded that there are two places he needs to investigate for this case: North Shirahebi Shrine, and Nadeko's house. He thinks going straight to the shrine is reckless, so he decides to start with Nadeko's house. After calling Hitagi to find out where it is, he disguises himself, putting on some less dark, more upstanding clothes and actually combing his hair. (Hitagi and her father are at Koyomi's house to meet the Araragi family; when Kaiki hears this he makes a snide remark, and Hitagi says she understands how silly it must look, but she has to keep up the pretense that she's not being targeted by a murderous and jealous god for death.)

Kaiki goes to the Sengoku household and meets Nadeko's parents. He tells them he's the father of a classmate of Nadeko's who also disappeared, and says he wanted to talk to them, since he thinks Nadeko might also have something to do with his daughter's disappearance. Kaiki gets the Sengoku parents to tell him all kinds of things about Nadeko, but they're all the adoring praises of doting parents, about how well-behaved and quiet she was, how she never rebelled, never did anything out of hand. He manages to wheedle them into showing him Nadeko's room. As he looks around, he thinks that there's an aura of forcedness to the cuteness of the room, as if Nadeko were being smothered with cuteness and molded into a certain image by the people around her. As he looks at her pictures from when she was young (all absolutely adorable, by the way), he wonders how many things she couldn't do, how many opportunities she lost, because she was expected to be cute all the time. Kaiki finally goes for the closet that Nadeko forbade Koyomi from opening way back in Nise when she invited him over for Twister; Nadeko's parents stop him, saying that Nadeko made them promise not to open it.

Kaiki leaves, thinking how strange it is that Nadeko's parents won't open the closet even after she's disappeared, in hopes of finding some clue to her disappearance. He calls Hitagi again and asks for her impressions about Nadeko, saying he thinks Nadeko must have had a dark side, but he isn't going to hear about it from her parents. Hitagi admits that she never actually met Nadeko; she spoke to her on the phone once to make the deal to buy time for them, and that was it. Kaiki says she was so cute that Hitagi must have hated her, and Hitagi agrees that even if they'd met under better circumstances, they never would have been friends because Hitagi hates that kind of cute brat most of all. Kaiki says he's going up to the shrine to see her, and Hitagi says when Koyomi goes, she only appears about one in five times, and he always comes back nearly dead. (It didn't even occur to me that he'd be crazy enough to go up there and see her at this point, but he is crazy, and he does like her, so it made sense once I heard it.) After verifying that Koyomi isn't going up there tonight (because he'll be with Hitagi—or not, as she claims afterward), Kaiki heads up.

There follows one incredibly weird scene. It made me laugh and creeped me out at the same time. Kaiki goes up to the offering box and throws in some money, then prays, hoping for Nadeko to appear. After a few moments, Nadeko bursts out of the doors of the shrine and screams "Here's Nadeko!" She's wearing just a short white shift and her snake hair, and looking very cute in spite of everything.

Nadeko says happily that she hasn't had anyone come up to visit her and that she's glad she finally has an adherent. Kaiki gets mad at her for calling him "Ojisan" and says his name is Kaiki Deishu. He admits in the narration that this was probably a mistake since someone must have told her that he was the one who sold the charm that got her into this to begin with—the root cause of all the evil that's occurred. But Nadeko's forgotten (if she ever knew—I don't remember her being told in Nise, after it all went down). She just apologizes for implying that he's old, and says he's very youthful after all, so youthful that at first she thought he might be younger than her. Kaiki comments that this girl is all mixed up—she forgets the important things, and remembers the trivial things, like how a friend's brother was once nice to her.

Nadeko complains that she was hoping to get some worshippers now that the temple's all nice and new, because she's lonely and wants to talk to someone. She's elated that Kaiki's come to talk to her and just talks and talks about whatever she can think of, babbling on about how delighted she is that he left 1000 yen for her. (Given how cheap he is, he must have really been afraid she wouldn't come out.) Kaiki comments that, like a child, she seems desperate to talk about something interesting, so he'll stay with her for a while. She lolls around on top of the offering box as she talks, looking happy and bright and adorable.

Somehow the subject of Koyomi comes up, and Nadeko explains the situation, seemingly ignoring Kaiki's slip-ups where he reveals that he knows more about Koyomi than he ought to. She says that Koyomi still comes to see her sometimes, but he always talks nonsense, so she doesn't come out to see him most of the time; the rest of the time, she gets overpowered by loneliness and comes out to talk to him even though she doesn't want to hear what he has to say. Kaiki asks her various questions, trying to get a feel for the situation and size her up. He asks whether she'd ever want to become human again, and Nadeko says no, even if she could be dating Koyomi. Nadeko says at this point she prefers the idea of killing him and having an eternal unrequited love. (She uses the word *bukkorosu*, which essentially means "Fucking kill him".)

Kaiki tells Nadeko he needs to go soon, and Nadeko begs him to stay and talk a little longer. She asks if he doesn't find her cute, particularly her snake hair, and Kaiki bluntly says she's creepy and weird. Nadeko is delighted with being called creepy and weird, saying no one ever said such things about her when she was human. She wonders if putting her snake hair up in a ponytail wouldn't make it less creepy (somehow).  Kaiki surmises that she felt stifled by her life as a human and feels much more comfortable and free as a god. 

Kaiki says he really does have to go, but he gives her a string and tells her to play with it. Nadeko asks if it's cat's cradle and Kaiki says she's heard of it; Nadeko answers that it was Nobita-kun's favorite (I assume that's a Doraemon character). Kaiki shows Nadeko a few patterns and says he has to go, but he'll be back before she's mastered all the patterns on that string.

The conversation between Kaiki and Nadeko was awesome. I assume the intention was to make us at once moe and creeped out by Nadeko, and it worked pretty well; for the most part she was super-adorable, but then she'd say, in that same super-adorable voice, that she was going to fucking kill Koyomi, and it would suddenly get really creepy. The interplay between her and Kaiki was really good, probably better than with anyone else that Nadeko's been paired with (her and Tsubasa just somehow didn't blend, both being calm characters, and Suruga was mostly talking to Koyomi; Nadeko just happened to be amused by their interaction. Oshino was probably the best; of course, Tsukihi-chan also made a good mix with Nadeko, with her weird alternation between fawning yuri-ism, strict motherliness, and good friend telling a hard truth). I especially liked when Nadeko told Kaiki how Koyomi enjoyed looking at her topless in buruma, and watching her writhe in a school swimsuit right on the grounds of this very shrine, and Kaiki wonders what the hell Koyomi was doing and whether he's a criminal. I also really liked the part when Kaiki told Nadeko she was creepy and Nadeko was delighted, then wondered if snake hair looks cuter in a ponytail.

It almost seemed like Kaiki felt sorry for Nadeko. Although he did say her cuteness was disgusting when he first saw her albums, he later seemed to think that she'd been somewhat forced into being cute by people around her, and that part of her problem might be that she was a bit shy when she was young, which everyone mistook for cuteness, which trapped her into the role of being cute and fulfilling everyone's expectations of her. He seemed to feel some sympathy for her loneliness and for the earnest way she tried with all her strength to be cute, like everyone wanted, so he would stay and talk with her for a while longer. I'm tempted to say this means things won't end so badly for Nadeko, but Kaiki is, I think, someone who knows how to separate his actions and his emotions. I almost wonder if he was in love with Izuko (or her sister, Tooe) and that's why he's so protective towards Suruga. After all, Oshino didn't seem to have any special attachment to Suruga. (I can't remember if he knew she was related to Tooe, but he always seemed to know things like that.) But even if he does feel sorry for Nadeko, I think he'll do whatever he has to to carry out the job he's taken. 

Kaiki seems stumped when he questions Nadeko and finds that she has no desire to be human again, but I think by the end of the episode, he has a plan, and the cat's cradle game is part of it. I hope that Tsubasa's entrance is being foreshadowed by Kaiki taking notice of her name every time it's mentioned.

Anyway, this was an incredible episode; even if a lot of it was still foreshadowing and development, it was awesome foreshadowing, and I have faith that it's leading into an awesome conclusion. If I could make three wishes for what I'd like to see before the end of this story, it would be 1. Tsubasa playing a part; 2. More interplay between Kaiki and Nadeko; 3. Another scene between Nadeko and Tsukihi-chan!! I don't expect I'll get the last one, and I might not get the other two either. Still, I don't feel like I really have to wish for a well-written conclusion to the story that began in Bakemonogatari, because I don't think there's any doubt that I'll get it. (Even if something terrible happens to poor Nadeko, who, despite her undeniable guilt in this, is still not completely at fault, because she was manipulated by Ougi.) By the way, I've liked Kaiki for a while, and this story confirms that he is awesome like I thought. At one point, I put him above Hitagi. At this point I think that's maybe too mean to Hitagi, but I would put him above Shinobu, at least.

## Hitagi End Part 3, January 6th, 2013:

After leaving the shrine, Kaiki returns to his hotel and lays around
on his bed for a while, after which he calls Hitagi and asks her to
come meet him so he can talk to her. Even though it's like ten at
night, she still comes.

After a weird opening with a duet of Kaiki and Hitagi that chronicles
their sentimental love in the style of a 90s anime (where Hitagi wears the usual white sundress and hat of a 90s sentimental anime girl, and Kaiki is
dressed like a cool older guy; imagery of white snakes wrapped around
crabs prevails), Hitagi and Kaiki meet at the station. Hitagi says
Kaiki almost looks like a decent person when he's dressed like that
(he's still got his hair gelled down and is wearing his "concerned
parent" outfit). Kaiki points out that Hitagi is wearing her uniform
even though it's vacation, and Hitagi says it's a symbol of the
strictly business-like relationship they have. 

Kaiki asks if there's a family restaurant around anywhere and Hitagi says you should always have reservations when entertaining a lady. Kaiki says he does make them, *if* he's entertaining a lady. They go to Mr. Donuts, where Hitagi orders water. Kaiki says he could buy her something, but Hitagi says she hates the idea of being treated by him. Kaiki says if that's the case, pay him back the airfare from the other day, and Hitagi, suitably chastised, says she needs more time for that.

They sit down, and Kaiki says that Hitagi never thinks before she speaks, and says she probably spoke carelessly like that to Nadeko as well. He then asks if Hitagi takes her bag with her when she's eating at a restaurant and leaves to use the bathroom. Hitagi says yes, if she's with him, and Kaiki asks if she takes her bag with her when she leaves the room at the Araragi house. He says Nadeko was that sort of person, and tells Hitagi that he met with Nadeko, to Hitagi's great shock.

Kaiki says he felt sorry for Nadeko for a minute, and Hitagi asks if he was taken in by her cuteness; Kaiki says he feels sorry for her because she never trusted anyone. She was never able to believe in anyone, including Koyomi, which is how things got to this terrible point. Kaiki then says that tricking her will be easy—even without his great skill, basically anyone except for Hitagi and Koyomi could trick her. Hitagi asks how that can be, and Kaiki says that she's an airhead. (He says "baka" in Japanese, but the subtitles say "airhead", and that suits how she was acting pretty well.)

Kaiki says she's very childish and immature, even for a middle-school girl. She's quite easy to manipulate (like Hitagi did when she made the deal to wait until graduation). He says although she never believed in other people, she also never sensed their true evil; she's blind to malice, and, childishly, she's very dependent on the kindness of strangers. (Her cuteness being a major help in acquiring it.) Because of this, she treats any act of malice that she does suffer, no matter how trivial, as hugely important and world-shattering. That's why the supposed betrayal of Koyomi when he found a girlfriend became so huge to her. (Even though he didn't even remember Nadeko, and they didn't meet again until after he was dating Hitagi.)

Kaiki says fooling her will be exceedingly simple: he's going to become a regular attendee at her shrine and build a bond of trust with her over the next while. Then he's going to tell Nadeko that Koyomi and Hitagi both died in a traffic accident. Hitagi thinks she won't possibly just believe that, but Kaiki says she will. He says that, on the off chance she doesn't, he's probably dead, but he thinks she'll buy it and won't bother to go check.

Kaiki earlier mentioned that Hitagi should just tell Koyomi what's going on. Hitagi doesn't want to because Koyomi is under the impression that Kaiki was her first love. After telling her his plan, Kaiki says she'll have to come up with a way to explain things to Koyomi and get him to give up on trying to change Nadeko, since Kaiki knows she enjoys her current existence and won't want to give it up. Hitagi says Koyomi wouldn't be Koyomi if he gave up on Nadeko, but she'll try. Hitagi excuses herself and goes to the bathroom. When she comes back, it's clear she's been crying, and she thanks Kaiki.

Kaiki hides it, but he's touched by her thanks. He isn't sure how he's going to accomplish it, though, because the money Hitagi gave him is running out. He goes to the bookstore and buys a cat's cradle book, then goes to "Relax Coffee" (whose logo is exactly that of Starbucks) to teach himself. He runs into Yotsugi, who has started making a V sign over her eye (like Stardust Witch Meruru) and saying "Peace, peace" after every sentence.

Yotsugi has a message from Gaen: she wants Kaiki to pull out of town. Gaen has a plan to put things on track in this town, and if Kaiki fails, no matter how small the chances of that are, the consequences would be disastrous. She's even offering 300 million yen, and threatening to cut all ties with Kaiki if he refuses. Kaiki thinks for thirty minutes and then turns the offer down, saying he wants more; Yotsugi can't communicate with Gaen and can't up that amount.

Gaen wasn't planning for Nadeko to become a god; she was actually planning to make Shinobu a god, which would restore the balance. She can still make her plan work with Nadeko, but not if Kaiki pisses her off by trying to trick her. (So, implicitly, Gaen wants him to let Nadeko kill Koyomi and Hitagi.) Kaiki accepts the 300 million, then immediately goes to the shrine, totally ignoring Gaen. He even says he feels sort of relieved to have cut all ties with her, since she was almost an enemy anyway.

Nadeko once again jumps out and says "Here's Nadeko!". (In Japanese she says "Nadeko da yo!" 「撫子だよ！」.) Kaiki tells her that he's decided to do a hundred-visit wish, saying he wants Nadeko to grant his wish. She'll find out the exact wish later, but basically, he wants a prosperous business.

[I foolishly ruined the ending in a small way but rather significant way when I went to get the kanji for Nadeko's name so I could be stupid and exult in the ease of entering Japanese text in Emacs. If only I didn't read so fast, too. The information had entered my brain before I could even think to stop reading.]

Nadeko begs Kaiki to teach her more cat's cradle. She already learned all the ones he showed her the other day. Kaiki asks her to bring out the string, but she broke it from playing with it too much, so she pulls out a snake biting its own tail. As he plays with Nadeko, Kaiki thinks that she's naive, an airhead, and a lunatic.

After he finishes playing with Nadeko (which seems to take a while, because it's getting dark when he leaves), Kaiki can sense himself being followed. He doesn't know who it is, but he assumes it's either Gaen or Koyomi (if it were Karen-chan, he figures she'd just attack him from behind). Kaiki takes a taxi back to town and calls Nadeko's parents, reassuming his role from the other day and telling them he might have something on his daughter and wants their opinion on it. Nadeko's parents leave the house, and Kaiki sneaks in and gets into the closet. He sees something that shocks him, but the episode ends before we get to see it.

Another excellent episode, with more great conversations with Kaiki, Hitagi, and Nadeko and a surprisingly fun meeting with Yotsugi. (I liked it when Kaiki said he'd punch Yotsugi if she didn't stop saying "Peace, peace"; he usually acts like he can put up with anything.) In the usual fashion, we got a simultaneous deconstruction and invocation of a moe trait, here Nadeko's cuteness. Although I was somewhat confused about the "never believing in anyone" part and where Kaiki got that from. I was also confused about Kaiki's reasons for taking the money from Gaen and then pursuing the case anyway. I know why he took the money, but clearly he isn't doing all of this, including making trouble with Gaen and risking his life on the small chance of Nadeko flipping out, just to be nice to Suruga in some abstract way. He did think it was nice when Hitagi thanked him, and he's previously shown some sympathy for Nadeko and even Karen-chan, so maybe he's actually a decent person? Maybe at this point he feels like he'd be letting down all of them, including Nadeko, if he left? I don't know. It even seems that he could reasonably assume someone else, maybe Tsubasa, would carry out the trick if he weren't around, now that he's told Hitagi how easy it would be to trick Nadeko. (Besides, Tsubasa has a common link with Nadeko, being rejected by Koyomi and trying to kill him, and also she's awesome, so I bet she could do it.) I think maybe the novels were more clear about this stuff, although Kaiki, as a consummate liar, may have just lied in his narration about his reasons.

Kaiki and Hitagi, in my opinion, are a lot more fun to watch than Koyomi and Hitagi, because Kaiki isn't the least bit afraid of her and always knows how to take her down a peg (even if his "not a lady" comment was a bit of a cheap shot). Pairing Hitagi up with Tsubasa and Kaiki was a good idea, because it let her recover from my ire at stealing Karen Bee and let us see lots of nice moments with her. Also, Hitagi looks cute in her snow clothes. Their sentimental 90s anime romantic opening was awesome too.

Although no one has been robbed in Monogatari: Second Season quite like Kuroneko was robbed in the Ore Imo finale, we haven't seen Suruga much at all. If I was a bigger Suruga fan, I'd be annoyed. (I like her, but I didn't miss her too much.) Even Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan have had more appearances. (Suruga appeared once, when she told Tsubasa she'd been summoned to meet Koyomi. Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan appeared together in the bath scene and card house scenes, and Karen-chan got the argument with Hitagi, and Tsukihi-chan got the scene with Nadeko in Otori, so individually they're equal to Suruga, and together they've got her beat 4 to 1.) Also, the quality and significance of their scenes is much higher. Tsukihi-chan even came close to being important to the plot by unbanging Nadeko and triggering her final insanity.

I could've definitely left Kabuki, but all the other second season stories have been brilliant, even if they could have all used more appearances of Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan. (I think they should get their own spinoff series, *Fire Sisters*, in which they go on adventures and have bizarre conversations.) I'm really looking forward to the ending, even if it was somewhat ruined by my stupidity.

## Hitagi End Part 4, January 14th, 2014:

For some reason I thought this was the last episode, but there are two more (it's an actual 26-episode series, just like they all were back in the days when all anime looked like that weird duet of Kaiki and Hitagi).

Not that much actually happens, but I do get one of my three wishes from before. (I've already gotten the one about Kaiki and Nadeko.) Kaiki comes back to his hotel, still reeling from what he saw in Nadeko's closet, and finds a note on his bed telling him to pull out. He calls Hitagi and tells her what happened, then asks if Gaen said anything like that to them. Hitagi says that Gaen wouldn't have said something like that to Koyomi since that would be like asking him to die without a fight, but that she may have said something to Tsubasa. Kaiki acts like he wants to talk to Tsubasa about it, but Hitagi says it's useless since Tsubasa is overseas. Hitagi asks why Kaiki continued the job after being offered 3 million yen, and Kaiki says since he has the money anyway, he figured he'd help out. Hitagi says she doesn't buy it; you'd quit your job if you won the lottery. Kaiki responds that that's childish reasoning and adults have many reasons for doing their jobs.

Hitagi asks if Kaiki is really going to do the hundred-visit to Nadeko, and Kaiki says probably not a hundred, but at least until the end of January. Hitagi says that concerns her; it's like going to see a hostess at a cabaret club. She says Nadeko is an enchantress. Kaiki asks if that means she did know Nadeko before the apotheosis, but Hitagi says no, it's just a feeling she has. (She seems to be afraid that Kaiki will become entranced by Nadeko's cuteness. That may show that she assumes Kaiki plans to do something horrible to Nadeko. But it doesn't seem like Kaiki is planning that.) Kaiki says the only feeling he got from Nadeko was airheadedness.

After the conversation, Kaiki draws some more pictures in his notebook, chronicling his plan and summing up the information he knows. He goes the next day to buy gifts for Nadeko. He gets some string, saying that he can't handle playing cat's cradle with an ouroboros again, and buys her a bottle of locally brewed sake, saying that this proves it's not a hostess club since it's more the kind of gift you'd bring to a business associate. He says that no god can resist sake, and adds that he's not giving alcohol to a middle school girl since she's not even human anymore. Kaiki goes to the shrine and drops in 20,000 yen instead of his usual 10,000. Nadeko makes her appearance and yells "Here's Nadeko!!", but in her surprise at the doubled offering, she trips and falls into the offering box. Nadeko is thrilled with the sake, since her father only ever drank beer. She asks what the difference is and Kaiki explains that sake is made from rice, while beer is made from grain. 

At this point, one of my three wishes was granted. My three wishes all had very different probabilities of being granted. My second wish had a very high probability, and in fact has already been granted, since we've gotten two more scenes between Kaiki and Nadeko with that same mixture of fun, cuteness, and creepiness. My first wish had 50/50 chances of coming true, and my third wish had like, a probability of 0.005. So it's my first wish that came true, and I'm grateful for it.

When Kaiki reaches the bottom of the stairs after his visit with Nadeko, Tsubasa is waiting for him. She hasn't been dyeing her hair (probably because no one cares overseas, it was just for the school that she dyed it), so it's all white striped. She's in winter clothes, including a pair of fuzzy earmuffs. Simply put, she's totally adorable, and I like how the winter clothes deemphasize her big boobs a little and make her figure seem more balanced. I might even like this look better than her pre-Nise look with the braid and glasses.

Tsubasa very politely introduces herself to Kaiki. Since she's already used his name, Kaiki is a bit thrown off, but he introduces himself anyway, and says a child shouldn't talk in such a polite way. Tsubasa says she's been wanting to meet him, and Kaiki says he assumes that Hitagi and Koyomi told her about him. Tsubasa says yes, but actually, she already knew about him, since she was the one who tracked him down for the Fire Sisters. She wants to talk to him, and Kaiki says he doesn't not want to talk to her (or something, he's obviously being standoffish, since he's been intrigued by Tsubasa ever since Hitagi first mentioned her).

They get in a taxi together and ride off to the next town, where Kaiki's hotel is. Kaiki asks if Hitagi was lying when she said Tsubasa was overseas, and Tsubasa says no, Hitagi truly believed she was overseas. Tsubasa did actually go overseas, and she's leaving again shortly, but she came back to Japan, presumably to meet Kaiki. She also mentions suspecting that Oshino wasn't overseas. Tsubasa asks Kaiki to come back to her hotel room and talk, and apologizes that her hotel probably isn't very nice since she doesn't have any money. Kaiki obliquely asks whether she's uncomfortable with a man coming to her room, and Tsubasa doesn't care about it all. (She's really becoming, to use her own words, "avant-garde".)

Back at her room, Tsubasa takes off her coat while Kaiki questions her about where she stands. He assumes she's on the side of Koyomi and Hitagi not dying, and Tsubasa says yes, and she doesn't care who makes it happen; it can be her, or him, or anyone. Kaiki assumes Tsubasa is going to ask about his motivations, just like Hitagi did earlier, but Tsubasa says she's not going to, which surprises Kaiki, since Hitagi always cares about things like that. Tsubasa says they should share their information, and the episode concludes.

Tsubasa's back! Yay! Not only did I love how super cute she looks with her striped hair and her elegant winter clothes (those pants and boots really suited her, too), I liked how seeing her from Kaiki's perspective gives us a fresh look at her, similar to when we saw Hitagi from Tsubasa's and Kaiki's perspectives, and when we saw Koyomi from Tsubasa's perspective. Kaiki has an odd stiffness about him as he interacts with Tsubasa, like he's not very comfortable; he's often blunt and abrupt when he speaks to her, and his positions suggest that he's ill at ease, exactly the opposite of the self-assured demeanor he assumes around Hitagi. I think Kaiki, as a conman, is good at reading people; he senses that Hitagi is full of bluster, and that Tsubasa is the real deal. So he acts confident around Hitagi, because he knows he has nothing to fear and that Hitagi has no real power. On the other hand, Tsubasa is overflowing with awesomeoness; she actually puts Kaiki in the situation that Hitagi is in with him—nothing he says can throw her, so he doesn't quite know what to do. If Tsubasa had confronted him during Karen Bee, things might have been quite different.

It seems that Tsubasa has been knee-deep in Gaen's plot ever since just after Tsubasa Tiger; she mentions that it was Gaen's talisman that started all of this by turning Nadeko into a god. She's the one who figured out on her own that Nadeko was out to kill Koyomi and Hitagi and went off to find Oshino. She also talked to Nadeko before leaving and gave her lots of good advice; I wonder if she knew or sensed that something was about to happen with Nadeko and was trying in some way to stop it? If Kaiki hadn't come in, I bet Tsubasa is the one who would have ended up dealing with the Nadeko situation (she had to appreciate the potential explosiveness of this Nadeko situation; after all, she knew better than anyone what it was like to come home and find a living room full of Koyomi's lovers). Tsubasa probably would have found her own way to do it, without deceit, and it would have been awesome. I'm looking forward to seeing her and Kaiki talk more next time, and finding out what was in Nadeko's closet. (Whatever it was dates back at least to early Nise, so if it turns out to be something snake god related, I will find that a bit of a stretch. Maybe it's a bunch of pictures of Hitagi around the town with a big red circle drawn around her. Or maybe it was those pictures that she made Tsukihi-chan give her from the time they decided to experiment with girls, just to see what it was like.)

## Hitagi End Part 5, January 23rd, 2014:

Tsubasa and Kaiki's conversation was just a bit disappointing; it was mostly so Kaiki could learn exactly what happened with Nadeko to make her become a god. Apparently Gaen thought that it wasn't the case that the town became a center of kai activity because Shinobu had come; rather, she thought that the lack of a god in the shrine had made the town a center of kai activity, which also drew in Shinobu. Her plan was to use the talisman to make Shinobu a god and put her at the shrine, hoping to stabilize things. Koyomi refused this plan for some reason (maybe because he would become human again if Shinobu were off being a god? Maybe Shinobu didn't want to leave him? Who knows). As a result, the talisman was just sitting around in his room, where Ougi could guide Nadeko to it and make her become a god. (Even if Nadeko went crazy all on her own, there's no way she knew where that talisman was or that it would make her a god. Kuchinawa's claim that it was just Nadeko's own psyche as she descended into madness has to be a lie from that perspective; at the very least, Ougi told her about it so she would go for it during her descent into insanity.)

Kaiki asks if Tsubasa ever met Nadeko and if so, what impression she got. Tsubasa says quiet, placid, obedient, and Kaiki writes her off as a naive kid, until she continues that that definitely wasn't the impression she got. Tsubasa says she felt like she was being snubbed. (It seems from what Nadeko said in Otori that Nadeko liked Tsubasa, but she was too weak and selfish to take Tsubasa's advice; she fully admitted to ignoring it in the Otori novel.) Nadeko claims to love Koyomi, but Tsubasa thinks Nadeko really only cares about herself. Kaiki says that's exactly it; Nadeko lives in her own world where she is the star. Tsubasa says even given that, she'd like to save Nadeko somehow, but Kaiki says if 'save' means 'turn back into a human', Tsubasa should first talk to her as a god, to see how happy she seems. Tsubasa, though, says just because someone seems happy doesn't mean she is. (Talking from personal experience.)

Tsubasa then asks about Oshino's family. Kaiki says Oshino has no family (and neither does Kaiki himself). He definitely doesn't have any brothers or sisters who could have given birth to a "niece". This proves once and for all that Ougi isn't related to Oshino at all. Tsubasa finishes by mentioning Nadeko's closet. Kaiki doesn't tell her that he already saw what's in there; when Tsubasa says it might be important, Kaiki thinks that it's something so insignificant that it couldn't possibly have any bearing on the case. He leaves without telling Tsubasa this, though he says he isn't quite sure why he kept it from her.

Kaiki spends the next week or so doing nothing but going to visit Nadeko. He brings her lots of toys, and also lots of bottles of sake, which she takes to with gusto. We see a montage of Nadeko playing with all sorts of traditional Japanese toys, and then see her sitting on the offering box and chugging a bottle of sake while surrounded by empty bottles. Kaiki mentions seeing a girl he used to know named Rouka who has grown up and lives in this town; he figures this might be useful someday, such as when he goes to see Kanbaru Suruga. (Rouka is one of Suruga's classmates, who was mentioned in Suruga Devil. In the novels, Suruga Devil was already past by this point, so we would know what the significance of Rouka was.)

The day before his final plan, Kaiki calls Hitagi and tells her that by that evening, she and Koyomi will be safe and they can go make out in celebration. Hitagi, however, is concerned. She has to convince Koyomi to stop going to visit Nadeko; but if she tells him that Kaiki deceived Nadeko, Koyomi will run off to go see her and make sure Kaiki didn't do anything nasty to her. But if she doesn't tell him, he'll eventually wonder why Nadeko isn't coming to kill them and go to see her, even if he doesn't go to her on a visit to convince her not to kill them. Kaiki tells Hitagi she should just say "Who's more important, Nadeko or me?" and bribe him to stop going, but Hitagi says she can't do that; if she could, things might have been easier, but there's a non-zero probability that Koyomi would go to Nadeko (the one in trouble). Kaiki says she could do what he's done with Nadeko: spend the next while getting on Koyomi's good side so she has some bargaining power when she tells him that Kaiki was involved in deceiving Nadeko. Hitagi says she can't just suddenly become that sort of person; Koyomi would get suspicious.

Hitagi admits that she feels a little bit lonely to think that she won't see Kaiki anymore after this. But she also tells Kaiki that this doesn't erase her past grudge. Although she's grateful to him, and will pay him anything he decides to come back and ask for later, she still wants him to stay away from their town. Kaiki says he's never broken a promise, and Hitagi says it's true, Kaiki has never lied to her. (Technically he did when he said he was in Okinawa, and also he was in Mister Donuts during Tsukihi Phoenix Part III, but I guess Hitagi means that when he swindled her family, he didn't actually lie. Plus, it's not clear if that Mister Donuts is actually in the town; it seems to be alongside the highway going out of town. By the way, some parts of that town look weirdly American—the Mister Donuts by the highway in the middle of a vast expanse of desert, and the freeway interchange where Koyomi and Karen fought during Karen Bee Part VI.)

On his way to Kitashirahebi Shrine the next day, Kaiki is waylaid at a train station by Yotsugi, who says "Peace, peace" again. Apparently she's on her way to see Koyomi, who she punningly refers to as "oni"-ichan, using the kanji for "devil". Yotsugi says she's not there on Gaen's behalf, although that seems to be a lie, because she proceeds to explain why Gaen is concerned that Kaiki might fail. Yotsugi mentions how Kaiki once swindled a small-time cult because a certain little girl's mother had joined them and become suckered in. He swindled them and they were ruined, but the mother just joined another cult, so it failed. Then he sensed that this little girl had no future if her mother stuck around, so he swindled the family to the point that they had to get a divorce. But he again failed, because that girl was still stricken by a kai, and the quality of her life was drastically lowered for a few years after that, both because of the kai and because of the debt her father had to pay back, leading to a lower standard of living. Yotsugi says that Gaen is worried that anytime Kaiki tries to do something nice, it always backfires and fails somehow; she'd rather he forget about Hitagi and his past relationship and just leave. (It was unclear whether "past relationship" meant with Hitagi or with someone else. If it's not Hitagi, my guess would be that he had some relationship with Tooe Gaen that leads to his protectiveness towards Suruga. It can't be just friendship, because Oshino didn't seem particularly protective towards Suruga, even suggesting cutting off her arm, and he was also in that club.)

Kaiki ascends the stairs to the shrine, thinking how Hitagi as a child seemed so fragile that he always thought she would crumble. But she never did, even when her mother did. He comes to the top of the stairs and summons Nadeko, who appears with her usual cry of "Here's Nadeko!!" Nadeko asks Kaiki what his wish is, and says although she's a new god and might not be able to grant it, she'll do her best. Kaiki says he can't tell her. Wishes spoken aloud lose their power and can never be granted. Nadeko says she's been telling him all this time about how she wants to kill Koyomi and Hitagi and the loli slave, and Kaiki says that's exactly why that wish will never be granted—all three of them were killed in a traffic accident. With a seductive smile, Nadeko says "So, Kaiki-san, you're going to deceive me too."

FAILURE!! Kaiki flashed on the screen as he was talking to Nadeko some text to the effect that he saw a flash of intelligence in her at that moment, a breaking through from her airheadedness. As with many things about Nadeko's character, it's hard to tell whether that flash of intelligence is real intelligence that she was never called on to use and thus didn't develop properly, or if it was just a realization that Kaiki was about to lie to her. It also wasn't clear whether her final line should be construed as "So, Kaiki-san, you're going to deceive *me* too"—i.e., she knew that he was deceptive and is saying he's now decided to give her the treatment—or "So, Kaiki-san, *you're* going to deceive me too"—i.e., like Koyomi and whoever else she perceives to have wronged her, Kaiki is going to deceive her.

I somehow can't see Nisio Isin killing off Kaiki. For one thing, death in a situation like this is usually redemptive. But while Kaiki has done lots of bad things, he's also done (or tried to do) good things. He's human; maybe he's not as good as some, but he's not purely evil either. So I don't think he particularly needs redemption, even for poetic justice, especially with the revelation that he was trying to help Hitagi the whole time, in his own way. If Kaiki's speech in the prologue of the novel about his inherent deceptiveness means anything, it seems to mean that he lied about his own amorality. Given his constant lying, he may have even been lying when he made that speech to Karen-chan about loving only money.

In light of this new knowledge about Kaiki, a lot of things that were hard to understand during Karen Bee make sense now. Kaiki has always spoken admiringly of Karen-chan; now we know he has a soft spot for cute young girls, given his behavior towards young Hitagi and Nadeko. He says during his ascent of the stairs that it's a miracle to be able to see a Hitagi like the current one. Kaiki was never going to let himself be punched and kicked, but he could have done much worse to Karen-chan than he did. He robbed her pink purse (even with the intention to leave her train fare) and attacked her with the wreathe-fire bee, which gave her a rather unpleasant fever for three days and then went away. He did it all in a way that suggests he wanted to give her a slap on the wrist, to teach her about the evil in the world, so that she would think twice about tangling with evil in the future. Kaiki, rather than an evil industrialist, is more like a John Edwards-type swindler; he makes money by faking magical effects, which usually doesn't hurt the person who receives it, because he doesn't really believe in kai, so none of his stuff has any real power. It only got so bad in Nadeko's case because she believed in the curse and went off looking for countercurses to undo the effects. 

Another reason I can't see Nisio Isin killing off Kaiki is that he never really kills anyone. Mayoi-chan was already dead (which didn't make her "death" any less tearful). Besides, there's the whole third season after this, and anytime you kill off a character, you lose a potential player in future events. From an author's perspective, it's a bad idea to kill someone if you think they could be even a little bit useful later, and Kaiki could be hugely useful later.

I think Tsubasa's appearance was mostly an info dump, but I still liked seeing her. I liked hearing her opinion about Nadeko, too, even though it seemed from what Nadeko said in Otori that she wasn't trying to snub Tsubasa (either when they had their talk later, or in Tsubasa Cat when she ran away because of the pure awesomeness flowing from Tsubasa, which Nadeko could detect and fear at an instinctual level. Or maybe it's because cats eat snakes.)

My guess is that knowing what's in the closet will become Kaiki's trump card in the next episode, when he has to reverse his track record of failure and do something nice. Since I already (unintentionally) ruined the ending for myself, I know what happens, but I'm curious to see how it comes about, since Kaiki's first attempt failed and Nadeko knows he's deceiving her.  

## The finale, February 17th, 2014:

I loved it.

As I thought, knowing what's in the closet becomes Kaiki's trump card. Nadeko summons a sea of snakes to entrap Kaiki and creates a gigantic snake spirit that can be seen from town. She yells at him, saying he's deceiving her just like Ougi did. Kaiki doesn't know who Ougi is, but it occurs to him that he never found out how Nadeko knew to look for the talisman that made her into a god. Kaiki realizes that she never, ever trusted him to begin with, because she snubs everyone.

Nadeko thinks that Kaiki was sent by Koyomi to deceive her and says she'll keep her deal, but as a penalty she's going to kill five people—Karen-chan, Tsukihi-chan, Tsubasa, Mayoi-chan (who she doesn't know is already gone), and, though she admits she really doesn't want to, Suruga. (So she does like Suruga.) She repeats Hitagi's words about hating cute brats like her, and seems put off by the fact that Hitagi hates her without even meeting her, but she also says she hates herself like that too, but that's how she is and she can't do anything about it. Kaiki asks if she's happy now and says she clearly isn't; she got so engrossed in cat's cradle while waiting six months because she's so bored. She can't grant anyone's wish anyway, because she doesn't have the right mindset to serve, since she doesn't care about anyone but herself.

Nadeko is about to kill Kaiki when Kaiki asks whether there was something she ever wanted to be other than a god. For instance, didn't she want to be a manga artist?

It turns out that the closet contained her manga that she couldn't let anyone ever see because it was so embarrassing. Kaiki says he picked the lock with a ten-yen coin, saying that's another reason he loves money. He then tells Nadeko that her art was amazing and her story was interesting, though the characters were unrealistic and the world was too sprawling and had too many disparate elements. Nadeko forgets she's a god and runs up and starts punching and kicking Kaiki while yelling at him for reading the manga. While she punches and kicks him, Kaiki asks her if she had a dream, if she misses her parents, those solidly middle-class and doting peoople, and if Koyomi is really worth more than the entire life she had as a human. Nadeko says she never really thought about becoming a manga artist, but Kaiki says she doesn't have to think about it, she just has to do it. Nadeko asks if it's really okay to flip-flop like that, and Kaiki says of course; humans do that all the time, and she's human. He says he knows of a woman who treats her current romance as if it's the first time she's ever been in love, and he thinks that's a good way to be. (He's been mentioning Hitagi every so often this whole time, and comparing her to Nadeko.) He says she should take the money he donated to her and use it to buy manga drawing supplies.

Nadeko dismisses the sea of snakes and agrees to become human again. Kaiki does something to her that makes her unconscious. At that moment, Koyomi runs up, presumably because he saw the giant snake. He's yelling for Nadeko and asking if she's all right. When he arrives, he sees Kaiki and asks what the hell Kaiki is doing to her. Kaiki says he did something like what he did to Karen-chan—this time it's a Slug Tofu (?). In three days, Nadeko will wake up and be fine.

Kaiki says that Izuko hired him to deceive Nadeko. Koyomi asks what Kaiki said to her, and Kaiki says he just told her about following her dreams and the usual things that adults say to children.  Kaiki takes the talisman out of her, and Nadeko becomes human again. Koyomi says he did this to her and he has to help her, but Kaiki says the best thing he can do for her, after he takes her home, is to never see her again. He says Nadeko becomes worthless when she's with him, and adds that Hitagi became better when she got with Koyomi, but Hitagi was worthless when she was with him. (So that means Nadeko's destined love is...Kaiki?!?)

Kaiki gives the talisman back to Koyomi and says to be more careful about who he makes into a god next time; Koyomi says he never wants to use such a dangerous thing again.

On his way out of town, Kaiki calls Hitagi and tells her what happened. Hitagi thanks him, but asks if he really thought she was in love with him back then; Kaiki says he did, and Hitagi says that means she managed to fool him. Kaiki asks what that means, and Hitagi says never mind and hangs up.

As Kaiki leaves, he ponders what it all means. He has apparently figured out that Hitagi sent the note that said to pull out to his hotel, though he can't figure out why. He also thinks that Gaen must have purposely given him money to complete the mission, and asked him to pull out because she knows that once someone says that, Kaiki will never pull out. In other words, Gaen was actually trying to ensure the success of his mission by giving him the funds and the mental obstinacy to complete it. He also wonders where Oshino, that good-natured guy who likes showing off for kids, went off to, and why he isn't around at a time like this.

Kaiki is stabbed all of a sudden from behind. He hears a middle school boy's voice and thinks that this must be the victim of a reflected curse. He never did think about who was tailing him. Kaiki thinks about Ougi, who was mentioned by Nadeko as her deceiver. Kaiki's mind races, trying to figure out who attacked him, as he apparently dies.

I loved the revalation that Nadeko had her manga hidden in that closet. It was hilarious and also made sense, given her constant allusions to manga and anime in the earlier material. In Nadeko's time as a god, she's always had this strange pattern of switching between being a cute airhead and being a frightening monster; when Kaiki brought up the manga, she switched into cute airhead mode. Despite the deadly serious stakes, Nadeko didn't use her powers at all; she just punched and kicked him, apparently doing very little damage. She didn't even draw blood, despite hitting him directly in the face many times, until the very last blow, a big kick that made Kaiki bleed from his mouth.

Even though it seems like Nisio Isin was trying to make us dislike Nadeko with this whole Otori/Koi story, I actually like her way way more now. Because not only is she cute, she also has some depth. That's what made me like Tsubasa so much; sure, she's super attractive, but so is Hitagi. So is Miu Menazuru from Gatekeepers 21. But I didn't like either of them as much as Tsubasa, and it's because Tsubasa was such an interesting character. She was flawed and even sometimes murderous, which just made her more fascinating. That's how I feel about Nadeko now. Before she was cute, but kind of boring; now she's cute and interesting. I don't want to move my top four now that Tsubasa's and Mayoi-chan's stories are over, and I don't want to demote Suruga over something that's not her fault (the animators delaying Hana), but I do like Nadeko a lot more now.

With that final scene, I now have an idea of what Ougi is. Ougi, I hypothesize, is the boy that Suruga allowed the Jagirinawa to rebound on in Nadeko Snake. The age is about right—younger than all the Naoetsu students, including Suruga, but not so far off in age. The sex is wrong, but as we see if we cheat and read ahead to Hana, Ougi becomes male. He/she became cursed by a kai and somehow began this evil plot to get back at Kaiki and Nadeko (and presumably Suruga and Koyomi and Oshino, too) and tried to turn Nadeko into a god and have her kill off everyone else.

I don't know if I believe that Kaiki is dead. For one thing, Kaiki narrated his own death, and he warned us at the beginning not to believe anything he says. I suspect that Nisio wasn't sure if he had any further use for Kaiki, so he did this so that if Kaiki never appeared again, we could assume he died; if he did appear again, well, he's a deceiver. I hope he does appear again; not only is he awesome, also all the reasons I gave last time for Kaiki not dying.

Hana is supposed to come out sometime during 2014; I hope it gets translated. 

## Hanamonogatari Parts 1 and 2, October 27th, 2014
Hana has been out for a while, but I've been watching other things and haven't caught up with it. Plus I was somewhat turned off by a review I read saying that it was mostly philosophical conversations and not much of the famous flirty conversations that make Monogatari awesome. (Those have really taken a hit throughout Second Season.) But now I'm watching Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works, and that's moving by one week at a time, so I figured now was the time to catch up with Hanamonogatari.

It begins pretty much like the novel, but the first scenes kind of lose something when we don't have Suruga's narration. They pretty much zip by, with all of her mother's bizarre witticisms shooting past and without us ever hearing what Suruga thought of them, or even being told they were things her mother told her when she was far too young to understand. The scene with Ougi is also hard to get through since I hate Ougi. (Even if he/she/it turns out to have a somewhat sympathetic backstory, I still hate Ougi.)

Suruga hears about Lord Devil from her classmate Higasa, the current captain of the basketball team and former vice-captain under Suruga, and decides to investigate, afraid it might be her. She calls Karen-chan, who we get to see (yay!). Karen-chan is growing back her ponytail (everyone liked the ponytail). She tells Suruga about the three ways to contact Lord Devil, as in the novel: you can write a letter, call a phone number, or meet in person. Suruga goes to meet Lord Devil in person and discovers it's Rouka Numachi, her basketball rival from middle school. Rouka broke her leg sometime around the end of her third year in middle school and the beginning of her first year in high school. She lost her sports scholarship and had to drop out of school since she couldn't pay the tuition. Rouka says she's a freeter, but then says she's actually unemployed since no one would hire her.

Suruga asks what she's doing, and Rouka says all she's really doing is collecting misery, to comfort herself that she's not the only misfortunate person in the world. She listens to people's miserable stories, like a counselor, and says she understands and she'll take care of it. Then she does nothing, and time heals all wounds, leading people to say that Lord Devil solves problems. She's only had two cases where she felt the problem needed to be addressed, and in those cases she contacted the authorities for the person.

Suruga is angry at first, and has a philosophical conversation with Rouka, but decides what Rouka's doing isn't a big deal and she's not going to do anything. Rouka says she wanted to meet again on the court, but that's a fantasy for both of them now, and gropes Suruga's breast before they part. On her way home, Suruga texts Koyomi to tell him that her old female friend groped her breast, and Koyomi sends a reply asking if he can join in.

The next day, Suruga wakes up to discover that her left arm is normal again. She's at first panicked that Koyomi might have died somehow, fulfilling her original wish, but Koyomi seems to be well from his texts. Suruga seems to be getting clumsy; she trips during her run and scrapes her left elbow pretty badly, but she just rolls up in a ball and laughs because she's so delighted that her left arm can be injured again. She asks Higasa for more information about Rouka. It seems after Rouka was injured, she and her family moved away, so no one knows where she is. Suruga goes to the next town to look for more information.

At the station, she runs in to Kaiki, who is not dead. He's wearing glasses and has a weird beard, which actually suits him since they cover up his depressing face and the purple bags under his eyes. Suruga tries to run away, but Kaiki is somehow able to run her down without any trouble, and Suruga is depressed that she was beaten in her only skill by a con man. Kaiki asks Suruga to come to coffee with him, but he actually brings her to a fancy yakiniku restaurant, at which he has a reservation for a private room. He grills Suruga's meat for her and exhorts her to eat, saying the word "meat" as much as possible. Kaiki explains that he's been trying to meet her ever since last summer, when he first came to town, but it's been hard since he can't come into town per his agreement with Koyomi and Hitagi. He remarks that you never know when a connection could benefit you, since he was able to meet Suruga thanks to his relationship with Hitagi and Koyomi. Suruga says they told her to run away without saying anything if she ever saw him. She also isn't happy that he keeps calling her "Gaen's child" and says she even prefers that he call her "Suruga", so Kaiki does.

Suruga thinks that she wants to hate Kaiki after everything Hitagi and Koyomi have told her, and gets mad at him for acting like an aloof but kind relative as he cooks and serves her meat. Kaiki guesses what she's thinking and says to give up, because he'll make sure she can't hate him. He tells Suruga that he met her mother when they were both young and that during college she was something like a tutor for him, and he promised to look after her child if anything ever happened to her. Suruga asks if Kaiki was in love with her mother, and Kaiki at first says it's a shame that it's always about love with young people, but then says he was. However, she was already with Suruga's father when they first met at college, and Kaiki also had a girlfriend himself, so nothing ever happened between them.

Kaiki gives Suruga his card and tells her to call him if she's ever in trouble. He says he won't ever con her, but he can con just about anyone she might need him to. (It's unclear whether he knows that she knows Nadeko; Nadeko mentioned killing Suruga during the Koimonogatari finale as a special addendum, since she said she really didn't want to but was going to in order to punish Koyomi. So he could know, but he was pretty busy at that time.) Kaiki says it would be better to contact him than to do something like ask the monkey's paw for help; he says a collector is coming soon to gather the monkey's paw, and when that time comes, Suruga should give it up without a fight. Suruga agrees to do so.

Once Kaiki's finished cooking meat for Suruga, he says he's going to go, since she obviously won't be able to enjoy her meat if he's there, and tells her to take her time, leaving a giant stack of money on the table. Suruga asks how he knew she was going to be at that station, and Kaiki says her friend Rouka Numachi told him.

Suruga goes to school the next day and finds Rouka sitting in her chair with the monkey's paw on her left arm. Suruga realizes that Rouka is the collector and wasn't just collecting misery. She asks when, and Rouka says it was as Suruga was enjoying having her breast groped, but it probably didn't take effect until the next morning.

It was okay, but not as good as I wanted. So far it's been more continuity fan-service than anything; we get to see what happened to Suruga after Koyomi and Hitagi graduated, and we get to find out why Kaiki agreed to con Nadeko for Suruga's sake, and we get more weirdness involving Ougi, probably leading into the third season novels. So far we haven't really seen any of the things we love about Suruga, like Schrodinger's panties or her flirting with Koyomi (other than that small scene where she sent him the text). It's sort of implied that Rouka has romantic feelings toward Suruga (unless that's just because all of us youngsters make everything about romance); I wish they would have made her a brighter character, and maybe made her engage in the same kind of interplay with Suruga that Koyomi does with the girls. This kind of is to Monogatari as the Vision of Escaflowne movie was to the Vision of Escaflowne TV series: a version that takes the dark undertones and strengthens them, adding a bleak feeling. The weird, surreal visuals are sharp as always (actually, they feel just a little bit sharper), and even more surreal than usual, such as when we see Rouka and Suruga sitting on a staircase, then have the camera pan out and show that the staircase is in the middle of a vast, empty plane and that it stops just above where the two are sitting, just leading to empty air.

I'm a little torn because I kind of think it would've been better if they'd done things in the same order as the novels, with Hanamonogatari before Koimonogatari, but I don't know if I could have kept going if Shinobu Time didn't come when it did. Mayoi Jiangshi was pretty bad, and Tsubasa Tiger felt good, but a little bare bones. Otori was good, but if Shinobu Time hadn't gone on being good, I don't know if I would've had the drive to keep going with the show.

It's kind of sad to see the Monogatari series run out of steam like this. The first two series were so good. I don't blame the animators, though, because the novels were also running out of steam by this point; Mayoi Jiangshi was just as bad, if not worse, in the novels. The difference is just that where the anime feels bare-bones and lacking in characterization, the novels felt bloated and bogged down in trivial details. That was kind of a trademark of the series early on, but the later material just went too far with it. The animators were stuck; they had limited time and bloated, overstuffed novels (except for Neko White, which I thought still moved at a good pace and had a reasonable ratio of plot to frivolity), so they decided to cut the novels down to the essentials. 

This is exactly why I never liked Zaregoto as much as Monogatari: because it was too heavy on philosophy and half-coherent rambling, and too light on characterization and plot. There was enough for it to still be worthwhile (plot, at least; the characters were all pretty obnoxious, like a whole cast of Hitagi), but not enough to make it essential.

Maybe the finale will be pretty cool and justify the whole thing. If Kaiki hadn't already shown his good side by becoming good friends with Nadeko, his and Suruga's scene would have gone a long way towards that, but as it is, while it was good scene, it wasn't enough.

## Hanamonogatari Parts 3–5, Wednesday, October 29th, 2014
It didn’t really redeem itself, but the last few episodes of Hanamonogatari weren’t completely without value, either.

The plot was padded with a ton of philosophical rambling, but basically, it goes like this: Rouka tells Suruga that she started collecting the demon parts and that she intends to collect them all. She got the first one, the left leg, because she was out collecting misery and a girl named Hinadori Rouka came to her. This girl was pregnant by her older boyfriend and her parents wouldn’t approve of their marriage and wanted her to abort the child. Hinadori made a wish on the monkey’s foot and ended up trying to kick her mother to death, in the same way that Suruga tried to punch Koyomi to death. Rouka took the monkey foot from her and decided to look for the rest.  Suruga asks if she’ll turn into a devil when she gets them, and Rouka doesn’t know, nor does she care. She tells Suruga to go enjoy herself with her human parts again. This scene takes place against the two of them having a basketball game, at the end of which Suruga says dunking always felt like cheating to her.  

Suruga thinks it’s none of her business and she goes for a run. Out on the outskirts of town, she collapses from tiredness where she’s almost run over by a yellow new Beetle, whose driver turns out to be Koyomi. (His hair is absurdly long now; it looks like he either spent five years in the wilderness or transformed into a Super Saiyan.) Koyomi drives her back to town, and on the way, they talk about Suruga’s situation. Koyomi tells Suruga since it’s bothering her so much, she doesn’t have to put up with it and it’s okay if she fights. (He also tells Suruga that Hitagi misses her, when Suruga admits she misses Hitagi. Hitagi never showed much emotion towards Suruga, but if we imagine that their time together was like their commentary on Suruga Monkey on the Bakemonogatari Blu-Ray, we can see why Hitagi would value it, even if she was never in love with Suruga.)

Suruga returns home to find that Kaiki left a box with the monkey’s head in the middle of her room. She receives a call from Karen-chan, who says she looked into Lord Devil and found that it’s Numachi Rouka. Suruga says she already met Rouka, but Karen-chan says that’s impossible because Rouka is dead—she slit her wrists during her first year of high school, shortly after her injury. (It wasn’t just the injury; she was also having problems at home.)

Suruga invites Rouka to the basketball court and challenges her to a basketball duel—if Suruga can sink a basket past Rouka’s defense, she wins, but if Rouka manages to get the ball from her, Rouka wins. The winner gets all the parts of the devil. Rouka comments that she knew Kaiki had the head and figures he was going to con her or sell it to her, but instead gave it to Suruga since he’s Suruga’s weird bag-eyed guardian. Suruga realizes that Rouka has no idea she’s dead when she asks if Rouka wants to go to heaven and determines that she needs to convince Rouka to go to heaven. She thinks that basketball is a team sport, and shocks Rouka by passing her the ball, then grabbing it and sliding around her. Rouka pursues and tries to grab the ball, but Suruga manages to dunk it and win, although Rouka points out afterwards that Suruga lost as soon as she passed Rouka the ball, and Suruga agrees and says she was surprised that Rouka followed her after that. Rouka says she somehow never realized that basketball was a team sport (in the sense that you have to actually work with the other people on the court). With that, Rouka disappears, leaving behind a devil’s left leg, left arm, torso, and some other part that I didn’t get a good look at.

Suruga gathers up all the parts, including the head, and takes them home. She goes to sleep (naked, naturally) and wakes up to find Koyomi standing over her. Shocked, she scrambles to cover herself, but Koyomi says seeing her naked is less arousing than seeing his sisters naked. Suruga says he’s going to jail for sure, and asks when he sees his sisters naked, and Koyomi says he sees it when he takes their clothes off, and Suruga says he’s going to jail twice, but Koyomi corrects her, saying he has two sisters, so he’s going to jail three times.

Koyomi compliments Suruga for achieving her goal, but says she might have gone too far. Suruga says she was using him as her model, and Koyomi protests, saying he never goes that far. Suruga asks Koyomi if he’ll take the monkey parts and says they’d make a nice snack for Shinobu. She then asks Koyomi if he has any wish he’d want to make on the monkey’s paw. Koyomi says he would wish that Karen-chan wasn’t his sister. Suruga expresses shock, and Koyomi amends that, saying it’s no fun if she’s not his sister and maybe he’d wish for her to be his stepsister, but that’s kind of a cheat, so maybe he would wish for the law to change. Suruga says she’s worried for Karen-chan’s future and Koyomi asks why, since he’d take care of her for his whole life. There was more philosophical jibber-jabber, but that was the last part I remember.

I like Suruga, and this story had the potential to be really interesting, so I’m sad that it wasn’t. I think there were two main reasons for this: unlike the case with Neko White or Otori, where we got to see into the heads of two of the more mysterious and guarded characters and learn more about their true selves, we didn’t see much of Suruga that we hadn’t seen before. Maybe this was less true in the novel, but Suruga was always much more straightforward and less guarded with her feelings than Tsubasa or Nadeko. The reason it was so interesting to see narration from those two was that they had all these complex, hard to understand, internally motivated feelings that manifested as apparently bizarre and unmotivated outward actions. Tsubasa was in love with Koyomi, but she never even thought about saying so, despite being with him every day and knowing better than anyone (except maybe Mayoi-chan) what he was really like. And her motivation for holding on to Black Haneakawa, and for continuing to defend her “parents”, were also mysterious and opaque before Neko White. Nadeko’s case was similar; she was a very mysterious character who could be innocent and almost prudish, but then purposely expose herself to Koyomi or play erotic games of Twister with him. Even though there were boys at school confessing to her, she was holding on to her crush on her friend’s brother who she hadn’t seen in years and who had forgotten about her. Neko White and Otori let us understand the motives and feelings at play in these mysterious and complex characters.

On the other hand, Suruga was always much more straightforward. Her motives for things were usually pretty obvious, even during Suruga Monkey. Unlike Tsubasa, who always hid her feelings behind her perfect honor student persona, and Nadeko, who always hid her feelings behind her bangs and her cute, childish persona, Suruga never hid anything; Tsubasa even remarks on this during their meeting in Neko White. I guess the closest thing would be the way she obessively duct tapes her left arm to a pillar every night as she sleeps, and checks the newspaper for crimes that sound like they could be her doing, which I noted as being interesting and effective in the novel, but which were barely emphasized in the anime. 

But the main reason is Rouka. She’s the character we’re really exploring here, since Suruga is out of it. All of Suruga’s actions are in response to Rouka. Unfortunately, Rouka isn’t nearly as interesting as she needs to be. I liked the hints of romance with Suruga (she teases Suruga by saying she’s going to kiss her, then kissing her lightly on the cheek; also, when they fall together after Suruga’s dunk, Suruga falls on top of her in a very suggestive way), and how we’re never sure if she actually has romantic feelings towards Suruga or if she’s just being manipulative. But overall, she’s not nearly as interesting as she needs to be, and it’s not because her base personality was lacking in potential; it’s because the main plot, delivered entirely through info dumps, takes so long to exercise that there are no pure character-building moments. Rouka never really *does* anything; she just stands around talking about stuff she’s done, so even though she has a defined personality, we never see it really cause or affect anything.

I’m pretty disappointed, especially because I expect this is the last we’ll see of Monogatari anime. It’s done its purpose of selling $300 action figures and art books and video games and ridiculously overpriced Blu-Ray sets that you can’t even watch because your piece of shit computer dies and the piece of shit software that came with your piece of shit Blu-Ray drive won’t work on Windows 8 unless you pay the company $80 for another piece of shit iteration that adds lens flares to the UI panels but still crashes every twenty minutes and skips constantly. (Why, yes, I did have my computer die...) The second season was pretty uneven overall. It had its high points (Otori, Koi, most of Neko White, the finale of Shinobu Time) and its low points (Mayoi Jiangshi, parts of Otori and Neko White, the rest of Shinobu Time), but I felt it was never quite as brilliant as Bake and Nise, and also was sadly lacking in Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan. (What we did get of them was awesome, though—Neko White bath scene, Otori wakeup scene with Tsukihi-chan and Nadeko, Karen-chan’s few appearances in Hana, all among the high points of their particular arcs.) I don’t expect the US will ever get the third season in any form; maybe someday some guy on the internet will blaze through a translation of the novels, but I don’t expect to ever see an anime. We’ll be left hanging on Ougi’s story and how Kaiki didn’t die forever. And unfortunately, the mediocre Hanamonogatari will be the last thing we ever get.

Well, here’s a ranking of the Second Season stories, because I already ranked the characters.

### 1. Nekomonogatari White (Tsubasa Tiger)
It really is the best after all. The only story that seems to retain the same mixture of clever comedy, character, cuteness, and action that characterized Bake and Nise. It also has the best opening.
### 2. Koimonogatari (Hitagi End)
I knew Kaiki was going to be back, and I’m glad it was for an amazing story like this one. I also enjoyed the sense that all the other stories led naturally to this one, and Nadeko as a god was cute.
### 3. Otorimonogatari (Nadeko Medusa)
The second-best opening and one of my favorite scenes of the entire second season, when Tsukihi-chan wakes up in bed with Nadeko and her hair is all messy. This one and Koi are neck and neck, and the top three are all far and away above the others.
### 4. Onimonogatari (Shinobu Time)
The first few scenes and the finale with Mayoi-chan were really good. The middle, where Shinobu recounts her past, was kind of boring. It was interesting how it tied in with Neko White and explained why Koyomi was gone on the first day of school, though we still never found out why he invited Suruga to the cram school (I assume we find out in the third season novels).
### 5. Kabukimonogatari (Mayoi Jiangshi)
