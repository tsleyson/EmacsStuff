* Thoughts on Kami-sama no Inai Nichiyoubi (Sunday Without God)

** Thoughts on Episode 1 and Episode 2, January 6, 2014:

I kept hearing all throughout the summer and fall 2013 anime seasons
how good this show was, and the title was cool, so I kept it in the
back of my mind and finally watched it today. 

It wasn't quite what I was expecting; I thought I'd be getting
something like Lain, full of quiet, dark pauses and eerie silence; or
else something like a darker Haibane Renmei. It's
really more like Trigun or Fate/Stay Night, although with a more
macabre theme. It was still pretty good, though; the technical
aspects are top-notch, the setup was intriguing, and it had some
decent humorous moments.

The world (which is mostly explained in Episode 2, at least as far as
the basics) is a pseudo-European pseudo-turn-of-the-century place
where people have stopped dying, and along with that, have lost the
ability to have children. No one really knows why, but the story is that God abandoned the world. People who die just stick around, though they slowly lose their humanity; the only way to get rid of them is to put them in a casket and have a gravekeeper, a type of mystical being with a magic shovel, bury the casket. Every village has a gravekeeper who handles the dead.

The main character, Ai, is a young girl who was forced to become the gravekeeper for a village when her mother, Alfa, the former gravekeeper, died somehow. She's been at work pre-digging a grave for everyone in the village ever since she started the job at seven years old. She's never met her father, but her mother always told her his name was Hampnie Hambart and that she would see him again someday. Ai is beloved by the village, who heap candy and cookies on her despite her vow to be a dignified gravekeeper. A young married couple named Yoki and Anna have been raising her ever since her mother died.

One day, Ai runs into an albino on her way home, who stops her and asks her in a rather bizarre way if she knows a woman named Hana. (He says "Question: Search class. Do you know a woman named Hana?") He's going to run off after Ai says she doesn't know (the reason for his rudeness is explained in Episode 2), but Ai stops him and first says he's pretty, then asks his name. When he says his named is Hampnie Hambart, Ai decides he must be her father, even though he looks pretty young for that. Hampnie manages to shake her off and continue on his way.

Ai returns to the village to find everyone dead. Hampnie killed them all. (He totally looks like a Trigun or Hellsing character, by the way. He even carries the requisite giant revolver.) Ai tries to beat him with her shovel, but he overcomes her and knocks her out. When she awakens, she finds that Hampnie has put everyone in the graveyard, and needs her to finish with them so they'll properly die.

Ai buries everyone and Hampnie asks what she's going to do now. Ai says she'll look for a village that needs a gravekeeper, but Hampnie says she'll never make it out there, and additionally, she's not a gravekeeper. Real gravekeepers, he says, are emotionless; her anger proves that she's not one. Also, real gravekeepers don't have parents. As proof, Hampnie exhibits Scar, a real gravekeeeper who he called presumably to make sure the villagers had a real burial. 

Episode 2 begins with Ai introducing herself to Scar and telling Scar she's pretty. Hampnie shows her that Scar isn't human by having her list her names other than Scar: Murderer, Reaper, Scar, etc. (It seems that people didn't like her much, although she seems pleasant enough.) Also, she has no parents and was born with no name, and responds to his weird search-class questions like a computer. Hampnie says that's what a real gravekeeper is like.

Hampnie also tells her that 'Hampnie Hambart' isn't a real name; it's the name of some toy, that he adopted as his alias while on the road. He says Ai's mother must have lied to her about her father, since he couldn't have been Hampnie Hambart. He asks Scar to bury the villagers for real, but Scar says they're fine. When Ai buried them, they really did pass on. From this, Hampnie forms the hypothesis that Ai is the child of a gravekeeper and a human. It's the only thing that makes sense, since she has parents and emotions, but can also use the magic spirit shovel.

Scar leaves, and Hampnie again asks Ai what she's planning to do. Ai repeats that she's going to look for a village that needs her, but Hampnie says the world is dangerous and full of people who would do wrong to her. For some reason he holds his gun to her head and asks if her determination is strong enough. He manages to make her cry that she doesn't want to die, but says in this world, that isn't enoughâ€”you have to want to live. He is about to fire, when a bullet passes through his chest.

The man who shot him, Julie (pronounced "Yuli"; judging by his last name, it seems to be Russian), jumps out and scoops up Ai. Julie is Hampnie's childhood friend; several years ago, Julie's wife was killed, but Julie hid her from the gravekeepers and lived with her and his daughter in peace for a while. Hampnie found out and turned Julie's wife in to the gravekeepers. Julie regards him as her murderer, and came to get revenge.

Hampnie asks why he isn't living a fulfilling life with his daughter, who should be turning fifteen this year, and Julie says she died too. He properly turned her in to the gravekeepers and came to get revenge on Hampnie. Hampnie taunts him, saying he just wants to die and decided to try and make his death mean something. Julie holds a gun to Ai's head, threatening to shoot her if Hampnie doesn't duel with him; Hampnie says fine, he'll duel, but he isn't going to let it mean anything, and sets the time for the next morning. It's also revealed during this conversation that Hampnie can't die; later in this episode, when we hear about the degradation of the dead, we find out the significance of this (and also why Hampnie turned in Julie's wife).

Ai gets up early the next morning and happens to run into Hampnie on her way out of town. Hampnie asks what she's doing, and Ai says she's going to leave town. Hampnie is ducking out of his duel with Julie, so he says he'll take Ai with him.

Julie is a huntsman by trade, so Hampnie knows they have to work hard to get a lead on him and escape, because he can track them pretty easily. Ai trips and twists her ankle on a bridge, so Hampnie (to her surprise) gives her a piggyback ride. Although he jumps off a bunch of cliffs while carrying her, which she doesn't enjoy, he means well, and later tells her his father used to take him for piggyback rides like that and he loved it. 

They spend the night in an abandoned stone shed. Ai asks why Hampnie killed all the villagers, and Hampnie says she'll discover why in time. It's implied that he suspects they were doing something sinister by keeping her there, ignorant of what real gravekeepers are like, letting her believe she was like the others. Hampnie asks how old she is, and Ai says she's twelve; Hampnie tells her that this means she was born after God abandoned the world, since that happened fifteen years ago. Since no one could have children after that, her birth is an anomaly.

He goes a little into his past: he's actually an albino (not just a bishounen who looks like one, but without any of the other characteristics). He used to be weak against sunlight, but after the abandonment, he found he couldn't die and was no longer weak against sunlight. He and Julie used to go to school together. He also compliments Ai for her sharpness in being able to follow some of the things he says.

Hampnie tells Ai his theory about what happened: he thinks God became bored with the world as it was and started trying to change things up by making people's wishes come true. Since people kept wishing not to die, he made them not die. But then some people wanted to die, so he sent the gravekeepers.

Ai realizes she's hungry, so she gets out a tin of cookies that the villagers gave her. She offers some to Hampnie, but he says he doesn't eat. However, to make her feel good, he has one. He also makes some coffee on the fire. (You'd think the fire would be risk with Julie after them.) Ai wonders why he's being nice to her when she's slowing him down.

There were some weird plot holes in the first two episodes (Scar suddenly appearing, and where exactly did Julie come from and why did he first save Ai and then hold a gun to her head, and why did Ai forgive Hampnie so quickly for killing everyone?), but the setup was pretty interesting, and there were also signs of keen attention to detail. For instance, they made sure to mention that Julie's daughter was born just before people stopped having children, and Hampnie really is an albino and really has some of their weaknesses. (Or did before he became immortal, anyway). I liked the air of mystery that the show maintains by dropping you right into the middle of things and only explaining the basic setup later, instead of having a cheesy prologue that explains it all.

The characters were pretty interesting, too. Ai was super cute. She's voiced by Aki Toyosaki, but she looks like Sakura Kinomoto. Even though we saw that she's sort of a ditz, like when the villagers gave her candy or when she called Hampnie and Scar pretty, we also saw here and there that she knows what time of day it is (such as when she wondered why Hampnie was helping her when he could make better time without her). Hampnie is sort of a large ham and has a streak of Alucard in him, but he managed to do some nice things, like giving Ai a piggyback ride and refusing to kill Julie, while still looking cool. I wasn't expecting to like him after he kileld the entire village, and I did think it was weird that Ai forgave him so quickly, but he doesn't seem like such a bad person. By the way, he's 32, so he's old enough to be Ai's father, although I don't know if that's where the series is going. I liked how both main characters had both a serious side and a less serious side to them.

I enjoyed Kami-sama no Inai Nichiyoubi, even though it's not the kind of thing I normally watch. I don't know if I'll keep liking the whole series, but I was intrigued, so I'm willing to give it a few more episodes. Ai is super-cute, so at least I won't ever be left bereft of moe.
