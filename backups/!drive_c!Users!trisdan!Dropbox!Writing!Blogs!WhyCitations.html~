<h1 id="why-you-have-to-cite-things">Why you have to cite things</h1>
<p>Working as an English tutor, the thing that most often seemed to scare and confuse the students was citing research sources. They knew they had to do it right, or the teacher would knock their grade, but otherwise it was just a flaming hoop to jump through on their ways to becoming nurses or addiction counselors or caterers or whatever.</p>
<p>Citation does have a point; the instructors aren’t just trying to torture you or destroy your dream to cater (or whatever). I had this conversation so many times that I figured I’d just write it down. To make it easy to understand, I’ll use the same format that English professors ask you to use for your essays. We’ve already seen my introduction—people think citation is pointless—and my thesis—it has a point. Here are my three supporting arguments:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Requring citation helps to detect plagiarism,</li>
<li>avoids copying information which is available somewhere else,</li>
<li>and increases the reliability of our knowledge by filtering out crackpots.</li>
</ol>
<p>To see why, you have to stop being a nurse or caterer for a while and become an academic, at least in your mind (no tweed suit necessary). The job of academics is creating and collecting knowledge. They get paid to do this on the theory that their knowledge will be useful for something someday. And to have any hope of being useful, it has to be correct. It’s also nice if the person who created some piece of useful knowledge gets the credit for it. And they can get on with creating knowledge much more quickly if they don’t have to repeat everything that’s ever been done in the field just to explain their one small addition to it.</p>
<p>To illustrate my points, I’d like to introduce you to Dr. Rhadamanthus W. Vinsfeld, PhD., MFA, DVM. He’s known as “Rhad” to his friends and “Dr. Vin” to his students and admirers. Dr. Vin has three degrees: a Doctor of Philosophy in dianetics, a Master of Fine Arts in video production, and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine. So he’s actually a doctor twice, as well as a master, and could rightfully be called Master Sergeant Master Doctor Rhadamanthus “Rhad” W. Vinsfeld, PhD., MFA, DVM (he was also in the army, where he achieved the rank of Master Sergeant).</p>
<p>You can trust Rhad, can’t you? After all, he’s got three degrees, he’s twice a doctor, twice a master, and once a sergeant. He served his country with distinction. And he believes unicorns are real.</p>
<p>Yes, in his groundbreaking paper “Unicorns are Real: An Objective Reappraisal of the Evidence”, Dr. Vin argues that unicorns are not, as supposed by mainstream science, mythical. He presents countless reports, statistics, charts, graphs, and eyewitness accounts confirming that unicorns are real, and that the Federal Bureau of Land Management has created a vast conspiracy to hide their existence from the public. He does not write a single citation anywhere in his paper.</p>
<p>In one passage from his paper, Dr. Vin claims to have discovered fossil unicorn horns in a cave in Montana. The fossil horns are real, and they’re in a museum in Chattanooga, Illinois. Dr. Vin writes at length about his eighteen-month campout with a group of beleaguered graduate students, digging and brushing and sweating.</p>
<p>Some members of the paleontology community are about to grudgingly admit that Dr. Vin did some good work, and recognize him for his contribution to the study of ceratopsian dinosaurs. But Dr. Shin has a suspicion. She definitely thinks she’s read that account somewhere before. Dr. Shin does some digging and finds a paper by Dr. Knea that examines those “unicorn” horns. Dr. Knea cites another paper, which identifies the discoverer of the horns as Dr. Travis Merrydreary. Dr. Shin investigates, and sure enough, it was Dr. Merrydreary who discovered the horns. He was going to donate them to his university—until Dr. Vin murdered him! If Dr. Knea hadn’t cited his sources, Dr. Shin would have had a much harder time uncovering Rhad’s plagiarism. But now, thanks to the power of citations, Dr. Vin can be brought to justice, as soon as he returns from his sabbatical in the jungles of Belize.</p>
<p>By the way, the plagiarism story also gives one reason why we have complicated, weird, strict formats for citing things, like MLA and APA. To find Dr. Merrydreary’s paper, Dr. Shin needed to know the title, the author, where it was published, and when it was published. Nowadays, Google can fill in a lot of the gaps that citation formats used to fill, so maybe citation formats will become less complicated in the future. But when you need to find one paper chronicling a sweaty eighteen months of digging, it’s nice to know that it’s called “A Sweaty Eighteen-Month Camping Trip that Ended With the Discovery of Three Ceratopsian Horns in a Cave in Montana”, it was written by Dr. Travis Merrydreary, and was published in 1983 in <em>The Journal of Sweaty Digging</em>, Volume II, Issue 37. That way you can go straight to the right issue instead of looking through the million or so issues of that journal in your university library until you find the right one.</p>
<p>Dr. Knea had to take extra trouble to write that citation so that Dr. Shin could benefit from it. But in another way, he saved himself some work too. When Dr. Knea wrote his taphonomic analysis of the horns, it was important for other paleontologists to know what the conditions were like in the cave where they were discovered: was it damp, was it dry, was the dirt sandy or rocky, was the cave high or low, were the walls made of sandstone or limestone? Dr. Knea could have repeated everything that Dr. Merrydreary wrote, like this: “According to Dr. Merrydreary, the cave was very dry and the dirt was sandy. Therefore the horns are cracked at the ends and pitted from the sand.” Instead, Dr. Knea cited Dr. Merrydreary’s paper; now, he can just say “The horns are cracked and pitted from the dry air and sand”, leaving you to go find Dr. Merrydreary’s paper if you need to know more about what it was like inside the cave. This is another reason why citations are helpful: if you need your readers to know something, and someone else has already written it down somewhere, don’t bother to repeat it. Just give them a pointer to the original source.</p>
<p>This might not seem like a big deal when all you’re doing is citing a couple of statistics, but some academic papers build on years of research, published in thirty different journals across thousands of pages. They <em>need</em> to be able to just point you to a source where you can fill in the gaps in your own knowledge. Copying all that work is impossible.</p>
<p>Let’s get back to Dr. Vin’s grounbreaking paper “Unicorns Are Real: An Objective Reappraisal of the Evidence”. Dr. Vin even has experimental evidence for some of his claims. In one passage, he describes an experiment he did to try and detect the presence of unicorns.</p>
<div class="long-quote">
<p>It is well known that unicorns are attracted by the presence of a pure maiden, but the nature of this attraction is poorly understood. However, our observation suggests that unicorns emit an energy field, believed to be electromagnetic in nature, which allows them to detect disturbances in the leylines and other forms of energy shift. It is thus plausible that pure maidens emit some kind of electromagnetic disturbance, and that this allows the unicorn to detect the presence of a pure maiden.</p>
To test this hypothesis, we collected a group of women, both pure maidens and slatterns, and tested them for the presence of an electromagnetic disturbance. Our tests found that 97% of the pure maidens produced a change in our instrumental readings, while only 0.0001% of the slatterns produced such a change. This clearly proves that pure maidens emit an electromagnetic disturbance detectable by unicorns.
</div>
<p>Notice what’s missing from that paragraph: citations. To make the kinds of claims he’s making, Dr. Vin should have mountains and mountains of citations showing evidence to support the things he just declares to be true: that unicorns are attracted to pure maidens, that they emit an energy field, that leylines exist and create energy disturbances, that other experiments similar to his have been successfully run. Most academics will immediately toss a paper that doesn’t have citations, so it’s more common for crackpots like Dr. Vin to cite dodgy resources, often their own previous work, and hope that no one will bother to check the reliability of these resources.</p>
<p>Getting into what makes a resource dodgy would take us too far off course, but I will say that academics have formal processes to check papers and make sure they’re on the level. The most important is peer review. When Dr. Vin tries to get his paper full of dodgy citations published in <em>Nature</em>, which is a reputable, peer-reviwed journal, the editors of <em>Nature</em> will get some experts in Dr. Vin’s field to come in, read his paper, and check his citations. Physicists and earth scientists will point out that according to the best work done in their disciplines, leylines probably don’t exist. Gynecologists will point out that there’s no evidence pure maidens have special electromagnetic field-creating organs. Paleontologists will point out that there’s no fossil evidence for unicorns, now that Dr. Vin’s “discovery” of the three horns in Montana has been discredited. And all the reviewers will point out that Dr. Vin’s story about how he did the experiment that “proved” pure maidens create electromagnetic disturbances is too vague to let anyone repeat the experiment. Dr. Vin never says how he tested for these disturbances, what kind of instruments he used, or how he separated the women into “pure maidens” and “slatterns”. And that’s just the beginning; there are all sorts of holes the reviewers could poke in this little experiment.</p>
<p>But how do we know the reviewers are right? How do we know Dr. Vin’s experiment wasn’t valid, that he didn’t really discover that pure maidens have special energy that attracts unicorns? That’s where the citations come in. Citations are a chance for an academic to show that other people have discovered evidence which supports the argument made in the paper. Dr. Vin may be right, but if no one else on the planet has ever seen any of the things he claims he saw, and the things he claims he saw all contradict a huge body of evidence built up by thousands of people over hundreds of years, it’s more likely that he’s a crackpot. By not putting citations, or by putting citations that just point to his own work or the work of other unreliable people, Dr. Vin makes himself look guilty. It’s as if he came into his murder trial and said “I’m innocent, but I have no evidence—please let me go”, then came in the next day and said “I’m innocent, because I said yesterday that I was innocent”, and then came in the day after and said “I’m innocent, because I said yesterday that I was innocent and Missy Waterfield, a third-grader from Gary, Indiana, wrote in to say she believes me.”</p>
<p>So I hope you now understand a little better what the point of citations is. They’re a way to keep the academic community honest and efficient. Now you can stop being an academic, go back to what you were when we started, and ask me the obvious question: Since I’m not an academic, why do I have to cite things?</p>
<p>Honest and efficient writing is nice, even when you’re not an academic. Government and industry have gotten themselves into trouble more than once because they took advice from writing that was dishonest and inefficient: 3000-page economic reports that used faulty models and outdated theories to “disprove” the dangers of a housing bubble; obfuscated safety reports that glossed over issues which later led to the deaths of coal miners, oil rig workers, and bridge builders; intelligence reports that spurred governments into declaring war on enemies who never knew they were enemies until the shooting started.</p>
<p>But if you’re still not convinced, I have an exercise for you. This very paper, the one you’re reading right now, does not cite a single reference. See if you can find work by someone else that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I plagiarized</li>
<li>Makes the same point as some huge chunk of what I’ve written here</li>
<li>Proves I’m a crackpot who believes that citation isn’t pointless.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you’ve done that, you’ll really understand why citations matter. I guarantee it.</p>
