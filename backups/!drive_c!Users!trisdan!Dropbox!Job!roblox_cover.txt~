Dear Roblox Team:

My name is Trisdan Leyson, and I like automation. When I first started learning to program, the ability to write a command like "cp *.jpg another/directory", and actually have all and only the JPEG files copied to another directory, seemed like a small miracle after all the times I'd painstakingly hunted down and selected every JPEG in some directory. At UC Davis, whenever I worked on a team with other students, I was the scripting expert. I was the one who handled testing automation, data munging, and build organization, because I was typically the only one in the group who knew Python.
