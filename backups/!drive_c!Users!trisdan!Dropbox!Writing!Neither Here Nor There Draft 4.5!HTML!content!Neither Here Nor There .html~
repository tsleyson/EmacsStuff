      <div class="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard">	His
father's possessions had all been in suitcases lining the hallways
for the last two weeks. There had been so many talks from both of
them, filled with vaguely ominous warnings of what was to come. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Now,
Yuji, your father is going to be making sure we're taken care of,
monetarily I mean, so...." She just let it hang there. When Yuji
hadn't replied—what was he <i>supposed </i>to say?—she
had added, "Your sister....I mean...."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji's
sister Shoko had been an annoying brat for the first ten years of her
life. A few years ago, she'd developed cancer. A few years ago
bizarrely coincided with the Watanabe family's big move from Colorado
to Sakura Memorial, which had been his father's puzzling idea.</p><p class="standard">	His
father had asked Yuji to come with <i>him</i>, and Yuji hadn't been
able to make any reply to that either—what was he <i>supposed
</i>to say? Sorry Dad, I love Mom more than you? Or the other way
around—Sorry Mom, sorry poor dying Shoko, I love Dad more than
you? 
</p><p class="standard">	Yet
somehow, none of it really made the facts resonate. Things continued
as usual. Yuji's friend Allen expressed sympathy that Yuji didn't
want or need, though it had surprised him to hear it from Allen.
Still nothing sank in. The arguing, his mother's loud voice matched
by his father's subdued replies, hadn't done it either. Neither had
the moving men, or his father's absence at breakfast, or his mother's
sobbing fit he had witnessed the other day.</p><p class="standard">	What
finally drove it all home was nothing more than a stupid letter. A
letter from the lawyer his parents had used as an intermediary. Yuji
had come home from school and found it in the mailbox. It expressed
the law firm's great regret over the divorce (tempered, Yuji was
sure, by their great joy over all the money they had received for
their services) and included a paper which needed to be signed by
both parents in order to finalize all the other papers they had
signed—to give signature for their signatures. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
placed the letter on the table and read it, standing over it with a
can of soda beside him. At the law firm's honeyed words, he abruptly
realized that his parents were split, and why he didn't know, for no
one had seen fit to tell him, but his life was being changed and
these people were turning a profit on it, and then sending
patronizing letters of regret. He punched the table in anger. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
practiced martial arts and was quite strong; he could have broken the
table, but there was no discipline in his blow. It upset the soda can
and spilled liquid over the two pages, nothing more. This only
angered him further. Yuji had considered having a glass of the
expensive scotch he kept hidden under his bed, his "crisis
scotch". He decided against it and he had left the house to cool
off.</p><p class="standard">	It
was a sunny, pleasant day outside; all should have felt right in the
world, but instead Yuji felt that nothing was right. He watched an
extremely thin man with long hair and a heavy stubble, carrying a
white leather purse and wearing a women's blouse, saunter his way
along shaking his hips like a beauty queen. <i>Nothing beautiful
about that, </i>Yuji thought. He wanted to beat the man for it.
<i>That's completely unfair and won't solve anything.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	I
know! I know, but do you think I care?</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	Yes.
You do.</i></p><p class="standard">	He
headed for a small place he knew about in the park, a secluded hill
surrounded by cherry trees that overlooked Lake Hybrea. The cherry
trees were in bloom right now, showering blossoms into the water
where they floated like tiny pink canoes until they were swept along
in the wake of one of the gondolas that ferried passengers to and
from the mall. Whenever Yuji needed peace, he liked to sit and watch
the slow, graceful watercraft slice through layers of pink blossoms
on their way to the glass tower in the center of the lake. The view
was especially beautiful at night, when the gondolas lit lanterns
that hung in their prows bobbing and weaving like will-o'-the-wisps,
and the mall glowed with the lights of five hundred shops,
restaurants, and boutiques.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
stared at the tower for a while, watching the sun reflect through the
glass, as if it were a mythical castle. Before leaving, his father
had given him a hundred dollars and a promise of another hundred
every two weeks. If he wanted to, he could pay three dollars to take
a gondola across the lake, and another fifty for a new video game for
his Pionnier de Jeu. But what difference would it make? Anyway,
depressed shopping wasn't a comfort mechanism Yuji wanted to develop;
it reeked of rich, middle-aged women. He wondered idly if his
father's payments would soon start coming in MCs, the new currency
being minted by the United Nations. The autonomous government of
Sakura Memorial had voted to replace the dollar with the MC,
following Japan, Russia, and the European Union; only America and the
United Kingdom were still holding out. Dollars were still accepted in
most places, but with the exchange rate placing the MC at double the
dollar's value, those who still used dollars were at a disadvantage.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
heard a voice behind him say, "It's beautiful, isn't it?"
It was a feminine voice, a tourist, he expected. Any moment now her
whipped husband would drag the brood up behind him. Yuji didn't turn
around.</p><p class="standard">	He
heard feet whispering delicately through the grass; the speaker was
coming up beside him. He turned to ask her what the hell she thought
she was doing, and maybe tell her off, and stopped short when he
caught sight of her. 
</p><p class="standard">	It
was possible she was a tourist, but she certainly wasn't being
followed by a husband and children, as she was younger than he by
about three years; since there was no one else around, it seemed she
had been talking to him. Yuji attempted to scratch up a reply.
"Yeah," he mumbled, and turned back to the lake, pointedly
ignoring her.</p><p class="standard">	The
girl seemed slightly dismayed by this, but she came and sat next to
him all the same, though she kept a yard or so of distance between
them.  Yuji glanced at her. She was pretty, he thought. Shining
red-golden hair, the ends trailing around her scapula, framed a pair
of sparkling aquamarine eyes. <i>She must be Japanese. Only an
elven-born could have eyes like that. </i>Her fair skin was like
porcelain, and seemed to absorb the light that reflected from her
hair. Her clothes were casual, yet elegant: a modest white blouse and
a navy blue pleated skirt that fell around her shins. All in all,
quite pretty. And all that did was make Yuji wish she would go away.</p><p class="standard">	<i>Pretty
girls don't like me, and I don't like them. Pretty usually equals
stupid—and not nice stupid, bitchy and high-maintenance stupid.</i></p><p class="standard">	The
girl stirred uncomfortably. <i>Geisha tactics, </i>Yuji thought
acidly. "You don't feel very good right now, do you?" she
said. "I don't know what, but something happened to you."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
didn't answer. He looked back out over the lake, and the girl
followed his lead. They stared silently for a few moments longer.</p><p class="standard">	"This
must be a beautiful view at night," said the girl awkwardly.</p><p class="standard">	"It
is," Yuji replied.</p><p class="standard">	Another
silent moment passed before the girl stood up. "Um....I hope
whatever's troubling you works out."</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
think it will," Yuji replied. "My parents divorced. Dad's
already gone." He realized he'd wanted to tell someone, anyone.
A stranger was best.</p><p class="standard">	"Oh
no, I'm sorry....I understand how you feel. I really do. My parents
are also split. Um....feel better, okay?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah."</p><p class="standard">	The
girl paused awkwardly, then asked, "Do you come here often?"</p><p class="standard">	"Sort
of."</p><p class="standard">	"Maybe
I'll see you again. Um, 'bye." She left in a hurry.</p><p class="standard">	<i>Yeah,
I can tell how much you, a complete stranger, cares about me. The
speed of your retreat is unequivocal proof. </i>He stopped for a
moment, wondering why he was being so pissy. 
</p><p class="standard">	<i>I'm
moping, </i>Yuji thought. He knew it, but he couldn't do anything
about it. The mope would have to disappear on its own. He got up to
go board a gondola and buy a new game.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	He
bought 'Full Metal Basket'. It was a new role-playing game made by
Japanese company Hanasoft. It followed the adventures of an
alchemist, Toru Hyundai, and her adventures with the Jyuunirenkin, a
group of twelve alchemists who transform into the animals of the
Chinese Zodiac when kissed by a member of the opposite sex. They had
been cursed by the cruel ruler of their country, Führer Akito.</p><p class="standard">	It
was a good game, but Yuji grew tired of playing after about an hour.
He switched it off to see what was on TV. The first thing that came
on was 'OMG I'm Like so Totally Freaking Out!' on the Disney Channel.
<i>Shoko must've been watching TV in here while I was gone. </i>He
changed the channel. TV Land was showing a rerun of 'Cheers'. On
Nickelodeon they were lowering children's IQs with episodes of
'Spongebob Squarepants'. Comedy Central was showing <i>another
</i>marathon of all ten existing episodes of 'Beat the Geeks'. The
History Channel was claiming that Hitler had had amphetamine-induced
psychic powers<i>. </i>Yuji left it there and zoned out while the
announcer clearly enunciated all the evidence for Hitler being a
precog.</p><p class="standard">	Obviously
Hitler wasn't an esper. If he had been, he would have won the war.
Like the Soviets. They'd almost won the war using espers, which the
announcer conveniently didn't mention. Taking amphetamines didn't
give you psychic powers. Back in Colorado there were a few guys who
would have had them if it did. 
</p><p class="standard">	They
had fried chicken for dinner that night, while Yuji's mother talked
about how difficult it was to find a job. Luckily, she had a degree
in business management, but even so it was hard. 
</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
left at six forty-two the next morning. He hated getting up early and
taking the train to school, but there were only two high schools in
the city, and he'd chosen the one less infested with gangs and drugs.
Not that that meant it wasn't. 
</p><p class="standard">	He
never brought anything worth stealing. Sometimes a few manga.
Sometimes he traded doujinshi with Allen at school, but the teachers
weren't very fond of that, so they usually went to a restaurant or
someone's house.</p><p class="standard">	He
boarded the train at seven. It was about ten minutes' walk from his
house to the station, and another ten minutes ride from station to
school. Even out here in the sticks the train was usually packed.
Getting a strap to hold was a feat, let alone somewhere to sit, and
as usual Yuji found neither. He stood surrounded by a throng. He
hated crowds. <i>I hate crowds. God, where do all these people come
from? Hasn't anyone on this planet ever heard of birth control! Okay,
I'm not here. A song. Um—Akiramenai! Nikogda otkazivatsya!
Tashika ni dareka mata waraisaseru, always!</i></p><p class="standard">	As
the train drew to a stop someone cried out, "Get back here, you
bastard!" For some reason this caused the crowd surrounding Yuji
to disperse. Someone ran past him and out the door and Yuji, spacing
out and reciting the lyrics to Nash Nagoi Nyeba's 'Akiramenai!
Nikogda Otkazivatsya!', didn't notice the one who ran into him and
knocked him flat.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
placed his hand on his forehead and jiggled his head back and forth
to shake off the stunned haze, then tried to see what had run into
him. It was a girl, with muscular arms and shapely legs. Her pair of
grey-black ponytails spread across the metal floor. Her loose-fitting
hot pink shirt had pulled tight around her breasts. Yuji
single-mindedly focused his attention on her face. “Sorry,”
he mumbled. He held out a hand to help her up.</p><p class="standard">	“You
should be!” snapped the girl. She seized his hand and Yuji
pulled her to her feet. She wobbled a little before catching her
balance and dusted off her shirt and her knee-length acid-green
pleated skirt. "Damn it....thanks to you, that bastard got away
with my watch...."</p><p class="standard">	"Was
it expensive?"</p><p class="standard">	"Of
course it was! Do you think I'd be chasing him if it wasn't?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't know. Maybe you're just crazy."</p><p class="standard">	The
girl ignored him and ran out to the train platform to see the clock.
"Oh no!" she screamed. "I'm going to be late!"</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
I'm sorry I delayed you," said Yuji as he followed her out.
"Seeya."</p><p class="standard">	"Wait!
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?"</p><p class="standard">	"Maybe,
but I haven't seen—"</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah!
You're Yuji Watanabe, aren't you? We have the same PE and Art
classes! I'm Mariko Takahashi." She held out her hand.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
looked into her rabbit-brown eyes. He shook it. "Nice to meet
you."</p><p class="standard">	"You're
the manga artist, huh? But you do regular art too. You did that oil
of Koretsu."</p><p class="standard">	"The
pink elephant from the TV show?" 
</p><p class="standard">	"No,
no! I mean <i>Koressa</i>, that goth chick who dropped out....The
teacher was freaking out."</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
a lot of people like that one."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
smiled, her eyes flashing with mischief. "I didn't say I liked
it. I just said you did it."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shrugged.</p><p class="standard">	"No,
I prefer your manga....I bought one of your doujin last year at the
Sakura Comic Fest. Bodacious dudes, man. Your chicks weren't bad
either, but I expect that from a guy. But for a guy to put that much
into his male characters...." She smiled. "A little of that
side in you?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
thought she was probably talking about 'Tsubasan', which had been a
book by the Sakura College Manga Club that he'd contributed three
pages to by mail. "Not really. It's all art to me. I like it
all. But I didn't think someone like you would go to SaComi." 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
go every year." She glanced at the clock again. "Damn! We'd
better go, or we'll be late. I'll see you later, Yuji." She
hurried off, running at full clip.</p><p class="standard">	"Later,"
said Yuji, too late. He glanced at the clock. There were still twenty
minutes in which to walk three blocks.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	It
had taken Yuji the expected five minutes to walk three blocks to
Robert Read Remembrance High School, sometimes known as RRR. The name
of the school generated more jokes than any other name Yuji had ever
heard. Some people like to bark "Ar! Ar! Ar!" like a small
dog. Others preferred a long pirate's "Arrrr". The other
school in town, a combined middle and high school in the Elizabethan
Quarter, was called Nanisgod Academy. There was a name no one could
make fun of—no one knew what the hell it meant to begin with. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
realized he'd been spacing out. He rounded the field, being careful
not to touch it, since the teachers yelled at anyone who went on the
field even while letting bullies mug other students in front of their
faces. The run-down old building was painted yellow. A mural of Billy
the Kid jumping a train, amateurishly rendered by the Art Club,
adorned the side wall. 
</p><p class="standard"><i>	Great
role model was Billy for us children, </i>Yuji
thought.<i> </i>The back wall
had a large red <strike>swastika</strike>
Star of David amateurishly rendered in spraypaint by the only member
of the Schlemiels gang who was also in the Art Club. <i>Okay,
Kaplan, we know you're a Jew. Thank you. </i>Allen
was Jewish too—a German Jew on his mother's side and a Russian
Jew on his father's—but he never felt the need to deface public
property so everyone knew it. His full name was Allen Amadeus
Sternheim, and it was the
only clue to his Jewish ancestry. He usually seemed like someone with
nothing on his mind but girls and the dirty magazines he used when he
couldn't get the real thing, which was most of the time. Making money
to spend on dirty magazines was also a frequent pursuit. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
spotted Allen chatting up a girl now: Jolie Rokudo, president of the
Yugoslavian Culture Club, captain of the girls' volleyball team, and
resident bitch. <i>Allen must feel lucky today. Either that or he's
wearing a cup.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	Maybe
both.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>"....so
anyway I asked this guy, 'How many Jews do you <i>think </i>it
takes to screw in a light bulb? Huh? Punk?' and kind of pushed him a
little."</p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>"What
did he do?" Jolie asked. She actually sounded interested.</p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>"Well,
he kind of backed down a little. He put down the broken bottle and
said to his bald girlfriend, 'C'mon, let's get outta here.' And <i>I
</i>said 'What'sa matter, Butch,
don't like the taste of the matzo in here?'"</p><p class="standard">	Jolie
burst out laughing. "That's <i>funny!</i>" she exclaimed.</p><p class="standard">	"I
thought it was all right," said Allen. He smiled slightly and
ruffled his terminally disheveled blonde hair in the back.</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
we'd better get to class. Call me later. We'll hang out."</p><p class="standard">	"Will
do," said Allen, sending her off with a naval salute. Yuji
waited until she was gone to approach.</p><p class="standard">	"Hey!
Yuji-boy!" He raised his palm for a high-five. Yuji ignored him
and walked past. Allen fell into step beside him. "Did you see
me?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
saw you. So what really happened?"</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
it was pretty much like that. Except with a chess clock instead of a
broken bottle. And in the chess club room instead of a bar. And with
Algernon Chibodee instead of Butch Christensen."</p><p class="standard">	"You
truly have a gift," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Hey,
if it'll get me into Jolie Rokudo's hot little shaka-shakas...."</p><p class="standard">	"Are
you actually going to call her?"</p><p class="standard">	Allen
shrugged. "She tipped over too easy. She'll want a date first to
test the waters, and I don't do tests....or easy."</p><p class="standard">	"Plus
you'd fail."</p><p class="standard">	"There
is that. Seriously, though, man, you should get a girlfriend! It's so
easy! From my dad's stories he makes it sound like climbing Mt.
Everest....More like kissing the Blarney Stone!"</p><p class="standard">	"You
know the locals pee on the Blarney Stone when they're drunk."
Yuji's mother had sent him to stay with his now-deceased Irish
grandfather about three years ago. The man was blastin Protestants in
heaven nowadays. "Is that what you mean? That kissing Jolie
Rokudo is like kissing a urine-soaked rock?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji,
Yuji, Yuji," Allen sighed. "It's that and much more. What
we need at this school is a Mt. Everest. Pretty, smart, wise to a
guy's tricks, and—hello, who is she? She's at least a Mt.
Kilimanjaro."</p><p class="standard">	He
pointed across the schoolyard to a girl. Yuji recognized her
instantly, although her garb was a little more officious today. Today
her red-golden hair was set above a white dress shirt, which was
tucked into a navy-blue skirt similar to yesterday's. She'd been
wearing sandals yesterday; today she was wearing brown Oxfords with
shin-high athletic socks. 
</p><p class="standard">	<i>No
way. It can't be her—or was meeting her just a coincidence? I
don't know, but this whole thing is weird. Hell, </i>she's <i>weird. </i>
</p><p class="standard">	"Something
on your mind?" Allen asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Nothing.
Yeah, she's cute. C'mon, let's get to class."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
and Allen had their first classes separately. Allen's was PE; he
spent most of it watching girls' legs. Yuji had Science. 
</p><p class="standard">	The
Science teacher was a nutcase who'd legally changed his name from
Gary Smith to Albert Einstein Smith because he somehow equated
teaching middle school students to make volcanoes out of baking soda
and vinegar with formulating the Theory of General Relativity. He
interspersed these "fun" projects with mind-numbing
textbook reading, and that was the kick he'd been on for the last few
days, so Yuji expected this class to be good for another hour of
sleep.</p><p class="standard">	In
every class, the approaching end of the school year had spurred the
teachers to do "sit with your friends 'cause it's the end of the
year!" seating charts, but Yuji didn't have any friends in this
class, so he was sitting by himself. So when the first six words out
of the teacher's mouth were "Class, we have a new student",
Yuji knew just where this new student would be sitting.</p><p class="standard">	"Class,
we have a new student. She should be along in a minute....Ah, here
she is. Come on up here."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
turned around and saw her standing in the doorway—the girl from
the lake, Allen's Mt. Kilimanjaro, and somehow, he wasn't surprised.</p><p class="standard">	She
came to the front of the room, her eyes darting nervously to and fro,
her hands folded over her waist. Yuji noticed those aquamarine-like
eyes fix briefly on him before moving on. <i>What does she want with
me? </i>
</p><p class="standard"><i>	Stop
that. She's not a government agent who's come to track and kill you.
She just looked at you because she's seen you before. </i>
</p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>"Go
ahead and introduce yourself."</p><p class="standard">	"Good
morning," the girl said. She closed her eyes and bowed, her
red-golden hair coming down and forming a curtain around her face.
"My name is Ai Maeda. I come from Kyoto, but I've also lived in
England, Ireland, and Finland. I was skipped a few grades when I came
here, so I'm a bit younger than everyone. I-I hope that won't stop us
from being friends. Nice to meet you. Please treat me well."</p><p class="standard">	Now
that he heard it, Yuji thought he could detect a hint of the UK and
Ireland in her English: she spoke very clearly, and her intonation
relied on patterns of long and short vowels instead of stress. Her
introduction though, with its lengthy and formal idiom, was all
Japanese. <i>Do they speak a different dialect around Kyoto? I'm not
sure.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>"Thank
you, Ms. Maeda. Why don't you sit at that table?" Mr. Einstein
Smith pointed to where Yuji was. "Mr. Watanabe, will you please
get a book for Ms. Maeda?"</p><p class="standard">	"Sure,"
said Yuji. He got up and brought one of the massive tomes to the
table, where the strange girl had seated herself.</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
good morning. W-we met at the lake the other day, didn't we?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah.
I'm Yuji Watanabe."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
smiled. "You don't look like a Yuji Watanabe. You look more like
a Kageryuu, or Kiritora." She stopped, looking ashamed. "I'm
sorry. I'm nervous, and I'm rambling. Sorry."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
okay." He could tell just from the vibe she was giving out.</p><p class="standard">	"Class,
please quiet down so we can read from our textbooks," the
teacher interrupted. Yuji opened his to Chapter 49, How Desert Plants
Survive. <i>This is the weirdest textbook ever. Chapter 49 is "How
Desert Plants Survive", Chapter 59 is "Why Drugs are Bad
For You", and Chapter 69 is "How to Have Safe Fun with 69
and its Art".</i></p><p class="standard">	He
noticed Ai scanning the table of contents for the section they were
supposed to be reading. "Chapter 49," he muttered. "Page
1592."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
okay. Thank you."</p><p class="standard">	Someone
began to read the section on how desert plants defended themselves
from predators in a low, halting voice. Yuji always wondered how
these people made it through nine years of school without learning
how to read. He quickly grew bored. 
</p><p class="standard">	Usually
when his attention flagged he had nothing to do but recite song
lyrics to himself, but today he could size up his new seatmate a bit
as she attempted to follow along in the book. Allen was right: she
really was cute. Beautiful, even. Her red-golden locks seemed to
capture all the light that hit them and send it back tenfold. The
elves had a word for that: <i>olecór</i>. Yuji imagined the
two of them stranded in the desert and her cutting her hair short so
they could weave the locks into a signal mirror and catch a passing
plane....</p><p class="standard">	<i>Is
that some kind of bizarre sexual fantasy?</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	I
don't think so. Just average craziness. You know, prisoners of war
don't go nuts because of torture or pain. They go nuts from boredom
and confinement. Just what we've got here.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>"Watanabe,
read the next three paragraphs please," Mr. Smith said suddenly,
snapping Yuji from his reverie.</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
uh, yeah, sure....” Yuji stammered, scanning up and down the
page for the spot he was supposed to be reading. "Uh, where are
we?"</p><p class="standard">	"Where
it says 'the'," said someone.</p><p class="standard">	<i>Great
help, moron</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>"Mr.
Watanabe, if you cannot pay attention I will have to send you to
detention," said Mr. Smith, perturbed. "Now, we are at the
top of page one thousand nine hundred and eighty-three...."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
was scowling at a paper bowl containing three soggy, rubbery nuggets
of some meat that everyone assumed was chicken, although there was no
real evidence to back this up. Across the table, Allen ate his
nuggets with apparent relish.</p><p class="standard">	"Something
wrong? You're not eating"</p><p class="standard">	"Do
I ever?" Yuji countered.</p><p class="standard">	"Good
point."</p><p class="standard">	They
were silent for a moment, staring at people moving past and moving to
the slop line and moving to the doors to the outside, and moving with
girlfriends and moving with boyfriends. In a back corner Butch
Christensen, the football star, was leaning on Miles Prower of the
Chess Club for his five dollars of bus fare and soda money.</p><p class="standard">	"You
gonna do something?" Allen asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Nope."</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't understand. You could take Butch apart if you wanted."</p><p class="standard">	"Nope."</p><p class="standard">	"I
know you can!"</p><p class="standard">	"Fighting
a person's not like breaking a board, Allen. The board doesn't move."</p><p class="standard">	"What
about denting a tetherball pole?"</p><p class="standard">	"Tetherball
poles don't move either."</p><p class="standard">	"Come
on, man, I know you could sweep the floor with him! Like when we
first met."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shook his head. "No. I just made things worse." He downed
one of the nuggets and swallowed it whole. It wasn't bad when you ate
it like that.</p><p class="standard">	Allen
shook his head. "I don't get you. You could do so many things
that you don't. Like getting a girlfriend—and hellooo, here
comes Kilimanjaro."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
turned around and saw Ai standing amidst a crowd with a tray of slop,
looking nervous and confused. He raised his hand. "Hey, Ai!"
he called. "Ai Maeda! Come on over!"</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
thank you so much," said Ai as a look of incredible relief
dawned on her face. She came over and sat next to Yuji. "I-I
haven't met anyone else here, and....I'm sorry, I'm rambling again."</p><p class="standard">	Allen
was staring at her. Rather than the greymeat nuggets, she had opted
for the greymeat and gravy. Yuji watched Allen watch her with a
rapturous look most people reserved for apparitions of the Virgin
Mary as she cut her Amazing Biscuit in half with the grapefruit spoon
on the edge of the spork. Plastic knives were a luxury the
overburdened taxpayers simply could not be bothered to pay for. She
spread on Land o' the Lost margarine from a squirt packet, took one
bite, made a face, and set it down. Only then did she notice Allen
staring at her.</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
hi. My name is Ai Maeda. I just started here today. Yuji and I sit
together in Science class, so...."</p><p class="standard">	"Did
Hemingway write a poem about you?" Allen asked. Yuji slapped
himself in the forehead.</p><p class="standard">	"Excuse
me?"</p><p class="standard">	"Or
was it Basho? Lord Byron? Lord Tennyson? Lord of the Flies?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't think that last one was a compliment," Yuji mumbled,
trying to get Allen to shut up before he made a complete fool of
himself. "Or a poet."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh
Queen Brammimonde, my lovely lady!"</p><p class="standard">	"Allen,
shut up," Yuji mumbled.</p><p class="standard">	"Ah
Marie Antoinette, my pretty, and Mata Hari too. Only Sakura, my
Piffle Princess, can be compared to you."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
do you read manga by MASH?" Ai asked, her interest piqued.</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?"</p><p class="standard">	"MASH
made <i>Sakura no Kaado Taisen </i>and <i>eLsu cHroNicLe</i>,"
Yuji quickly explained. 
</p><p class="standard">	"But
Mai Serifu-chan...."</p><p class="standard">	"MASH,
MASH made them!" Yuji cut him off. He could see Allen getting
ready to go further, so he said, "Allen, why don't we take Ai
out to a restaurant?"</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?
Oh, yeah. Good idea. Ditching school. Fun times."</p><p class="standard">	"We're
not ditching, we're just going to a restaurant....Ai?"</p><p class="standard">	"Well...."
She looked down at her greymeat and gravy. "Sure, why not."</p><p class="standard">	</p><p class="standard">	Ai
had to use the restroom before they left, so Yuji and Allen were
sitting alone at the table. "Man. Here I am going to a
restaurant with Kilimanjaro and I'm stuck with <i>you....</i>"</p><p class="standard">	"Maybe
I'm the one stuck with <i>you</i>," Yuji shot back.</p><p class="standard">	"Are
you into her?"</p><p class="standard">	He
shrugged. "She's cute, but kind of weird, and I just met her."</p><p class="standard">	"And
what's up with that whole MASH thing, huh?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
sighed. "Allen, Mai Serifu-chan is me."</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?"</p><p class="standard">	"The
doujin group Mai Serifu. It's me. I drew those doujins and posted
them on the internet and then gave them to you."</p><p class="standard">	"How
could you not tell me this? Now I look like a jackass!"</p><p class="standard">	"You
did it to yourself by throwing away the cover pages! It says in the
foreward to 'Sakura no Kaado Chinchin' that Mai Serifu is a doujin
group who adapts the works of MASH. I thanked them in the afterward
of every book. And didn't you notice how 'Mai Serifu' obviously comes
from 'my self?'"</p><p class="standard">	"I
guess I just never—okay, fine. I'll give you that. So what
happens in this MASH version, anyway? Are there any salty babes?"</p><p class="standard">	"The
same ones from the doujin," said Yuji. "Sakura, the
princess, her friend Toroko, and Yuka, the time-space sorceress."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
you do read MASH?" Ai asked as she returned.</p><p class="standard">	"I've
read a little," said Yuji. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Any
of their earlier stuff?"</p><p class="standard">	"<i>Tokyo
Ziggurat</i>, and <i>Zeta Chrnos. </i>I like their later stuff more,
though. <i>Chocobits </i>was one of the best. I really like <i>Sakura
no Kaado Taisen </i>and <i>eLsu </i><i>cHroNicLe </i>too."</p><p class="standard">	The
three of them tossed their slop and casually went outside as if they
were going to recess. It wasn't technically against the rules to
leave school for lunch, but it wasn't technically permitted either.
But Yuji couldn't stomach another greymeat nugget, and he didn't want
Ai to get dysentery on her first day either.</p><p class="standard">	The
neighborhood wasn't overly poor, and didn't have too much of drugs or
gang violence. So Yuji wasn't too worried about walking down the
street. But the entire northern end of Sakura Memorial sent their
children to RRR, other than the small group whose kids attended
expensive private schools based in the Outer Rim, so the school was
actually the most dangerous part of the area. The Jewish gangs didn't
sell drugs or run guns, but they had a tendency to start knife fights
in the dead field out back, leading down to the canal. They had
really formed gangs out of boredom, as most of them were fairly
well-off.</p><p class="standard">	Allen
didn't live anywhere near here, but he knew all the best places to
eat. He pointed to a place on the other side of the road and said,
"That guy's a <i>schnook. </i>This one up here's a <i>schlemiel</i>.
And him—fuhgeddaboutit!"</p><p class="standard">	"Allen,
would you quit with the New York Yiddish? You've lived here your
whole life and you wouldn't know the Empire State Building if it fell
on you."</p><p class="standard">	"Just
showing Ms. Maeda some local flavor," Allen replied defensively.
	</p><p class="standard">	"You
wouldn't set foot in a synagogue if someone had gutted it and turned
it into a porn shop."</p><p class="standard">	"I
beg to differ!"</p><p class="standard">	"The
soul o' faith so y'are," said Yuji in an Irish accent. "<i>Is
fuinneog</i> <i>an Dhia sé</i>. Erra. <i>Téigh go
hifreann</i>."</p><p class="standard">	"Um....So
you're really Jewish, Mr. Sternheim?" Ai asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Am
I really Jewish. <i>Am </i>I really Jewish," Allen scoffed.</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
sorry. It's just, there weren't many in Japan. Actually there weren't
any....and you're Irish, Mr. Watanabe?"</p><p class="standard">	"Half,"
said Yuji. "I'm half-Japanese. As you can tell from my name.
But," he added for Allen's benefit, "I don't feel the need
to run around in a kimono, bowing, drinking sake, and telling people
<i>póg mo thóin</i>."</p><p class="standard">	"Eh,
you ruin everything," said Allen. For some reason, he always
started sounding more Jewish when he was talking up a girl. Yuji
thought he'd probably learned how to do it from watching old Mel
Brooks movies. "This guy, he ruins everything. He likes to ruin
things. Ruining's what he does."</p><p class="standard">	"Irish
broken beats Yiddish over-spoken," Yuji misquoted his
grandfather. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Ruins,
ruins ruins," Allen continued. "Ah, this is the place,
where we want to go!"</p><p class="standard">	They
stopped in front of a tiny delicatessen/restaurant that looked
identical to thirty others on the same block. The first time they'd
come, Yuji had been skeptical, but he now knew that whatever Allen
didn't know about Yiddish or the Torah was made up for by what he did
know about the restaurants on this street.</p><p class="standard">	The
lettering on the front window read "Schlesinger's". There
were sides of beef and seasoned hams hung in the window. Allen led
the way into the packed restaurant.</p><p class="standard">	As
soon as the owner saw them sit down at the last empty booth, he
immediately came over. "Allen, Yuji! This, this is a surprise!"
the paunchy man in the apron exclaimed. "To what do I owe the
pleasure?"</p><p class="standard">	"A
new friend and one too many nuggets," said Allen. "This is
Ai Maeda. She's with me. Ms. Maeda, Giles Schlesinger."<br />	"Very
nice to meetcha," said Giles, pumping Ai's hand vigorously. She
didn't look too happy, but she answered politely enough.</p><p class="standard">	"Nice
to meet you."</p><p class="standard">	"So,
what'll ya all have?"</p><p class="standard">	Allen
ordered ham with cheddar, no onions, and Yuji turkey with pepper jack
and everything on it, without having to look at the menu. Ai scanned
the columns and ordered chicken salad.</p><p class="standard">	"So,
tell me about this MASH," said Allen to Ai. He was sitting
across from her, with Yuji next to her. Yuji could tell she was
nervous. He didn't blame her; she knew nothing about the two of them.
For all she knew, they were planning on drugging her cola and raping
her. Allen was certainly coming on that way.</p><p class="standard">	"Er,
well....They're a manga group. Right? You've really never heard of
them?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
was betrayed by a friend," said Allen. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shrugged, utterly unconcerned. He got up to go to the bathroom.</p><p class="standard">	On
the way he ran into a twin-ponytailed being swathed in fluorescence.
"Hey! Yuji Watanabe! We met this morning on the train."<br />	"Uh,
yeah...."</p><p class="standard">	"It's
Mariko Takahashi."</p><p class="standard">	"I
know. I'm just wondering what you're doing here."</p><p class="standard">	"Eating,
obviously!"</p><p class="standard">	"Are
you Jewish, then?"</p><p class="standard">	"Am
I Jewish. <i>Am </i>I Jewish," Mariko scoffed. "Of course
not! Why do you think I'm named 'Mariko Takahashi?'"</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't know! Maybe you're just crazy."</p><p class="standard">	"I
know all the best restaurants in this town. This is the best place
within a mile of the school, and the service is fast. So, you here
with anyone?"</p><p class="standard">	"My
friend Allen, and the new girl, Ai Maeda...."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
great! I couldn't get anyone to skip with me. Let me hang out with
you guys."</p><p class="standard">	"Er,
all right....I guess. Just let me go to the bathroom."</p><p class="standard">	As
soon as Yuji came back he felt sorry for leaving Ai alone with Allen.
She was obviously confused, nervous, disgusted, and wishing she'd
never come. Allen was redoing the story of his epic barroom brawl
with Butch Christensen, the ROTC captain.</p><p class="standard">	"So
anyway <i>I </i>says to him, 'What'sa matter, Butch, don't like the
taste of the matzo in here?'"</p><p class="standard">	Ai
smiled weakly. "Yeah....that's funny."</p><p class="standard">	"Isn't
it? Eh? Eh?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
cleared his throat. "Eh-hem. This is Mariko Takahashi. She wants
to hang out with us. Mariko, go ahead and sit here." He seated
her next to Ai, thinking perhaps sitting next to a girl would ease
her a bit. He himself sat next to Allen, putting the two guys across
from the two girls. 
</p><p class="standard">	<i>This
looks like a round-robin date. I chat up Mariko, Allen chats up Ai,
then swing your pardner round an' round, switch!</i> <i>All we need's
one more pair.</i></p><p class="standard">	Except
that Mariko had begun talking to Ai, making it a same-sex round-robin
date. "Hey. I'm Mariko Takahashi."</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
pleased to meet you. My name is Ai Maeda. I'm new in town."</p><p class="standard">	"So
Yuji told me. Where'd you move from?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
moved from Japan."</p><p class="standard">	<i>"Aah,
Nippon. Nihongo wo hanashimasu ka?"</i></p><p class="standard">	<i>"Hai,
Nihongo hanashiharu no. Mariko-han no Nihongo ga jouzu ni </i>
</p><p class="standard"><i>naraiharu."</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	"Ma,
zenzen."</i></p><p class="standard">	"What're
they saying?" Allen asked Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Mariko
asked Ai if she spoke Japanese, Ai said yes and complimented Mariko's
Japanese, and Mariko denied the compliment," Yuji replied.</p><p class="standard">	<i>"Allen
wa Nihongo wakarimasen," </i>said Mariko. <i>"Eigo wo
hanashimashou ka?"</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	"Un,
hanashite kudasai," </i>Yuji
put in.</p><p class="standard">	"What're
you all saying about me?" Allen asked suspiciously.</p><p class="standard">	<i>"Baka
da ne," </i>Mariko commented.</p><p class="standard">	"Hey!
I understood that!"</p><p class="standard">	"You
should've come to class instead of cutting to hit on sixth-grade
girls," said Yuji. "Then you'd understand all of it."</p><p class="standard">	"This,
this is discrimination!" Allen complained, assuming his Mel
Brooks voice again. "My people's sad fate."</p><p class="standard">	"Hey,
Ai, what period have you got Art and PE?" Mariko asked.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
took out her class schedule and checked it over. "Um....I have
Art sixth period and PE seventh."</p><p class="standard">	"Hey,
cool. You're with me and Yuji. Don't worry, we'll look out for ya and
make sure no one picks on ya."</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
thanks...." Ai smiled. Yuji realized he'd never seen her do that
before. It was pure, genuine. It concealed no lies and no ulterior
motives: an expression of happiness. The elves had a word for that
too: <i>myálrath.</i></p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	As
it turned out, Mariko was a fan of MASH, as well as Yuu Nagase, "at
least before she married Hazuki Takahashi and they started working
together." So when it came time to return to school, she and Ai
ended up ahead, discussing Fushigi Yugioh: Mysterious King of Games
and Ayashige na Demeter. Yuji's favorite work of Yuu Nagase's was the
less popular Nekodoki!, a schoolyard romance and her last series
before marriage. Dorothy 19th wasn't bad either.</p><p class="standard">	"Listen
man," Allen began. He glanced furtively at the girls to make
sure their backs were still turned (and probably to see if the wind
had done anything to their skirts). "I apologize."</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?
For what?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
underestimated you. You've brought us within sight of Mt. Kilimanjaro
<i>and </i>Mt. McKinley. All that's left to do now is decide who
climbs on which mountain. And man, I'll be happy with whichever,
'cause I see what you accomplished. Yeah. You're the one who did it,
not me. But you did it so well, all that's left to choose is whether
you like 'em petite or busty."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
stared at him for a moment. "What the hell are you babbling
about?"</p><p class="standard">	"The
girls, man!" Allen gestured at their backs with an overdone hand
motion that reminded Yuji of Captain Kirk. Ai glanced back over her
shoulder. Allen flashed her a grin and she returned it weakly, then
went back to Mariko. He shook his head admiringly. "I dunno how
you did it, man."</p><p class="standard">	"How
I did what?"</p><p class="standard">	"Well
first you just yell out to Kilimanjaro and get her over to our table,
then you just happen to 'run into' McKinley at the deli and you get
<i>her </i>over to our table too. Man, it's like, I dunno....dude."</p><p class="standard">	"Man,
dude, you're one wicked articulator!" Yuji taunted him.</p><p class="standard">	"Okay,
okay. Play dumb. But I know that you know that we're gonna end up in
'Manjaro and McKinley's hot little swee-swees, and I know that you're
thinking about which swee-swee you wanna end up in."</p><p class="standard">	"Neither,"
said Yuji. "I'm not interested in girls."</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
give me that! All guys are interested in girls."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
not," said Yuji firmly.</p><p class="standard">	Somehow
Allen understood that it was time to drop it. It was just one of
those things. Yuji could easily do it, but he wouldn't, like taking
down Butch Christensen. Allen shrugged. "Okay then. But I'll
leave one for you in case you like, change your mind."</p><p class="standard">	"I
won't."</p><p class="standard">	</p><p class="standard">	Boys
and girls had PE separately, but there wasn't enough money in the
budget for separate facilities and the discrimination laws prohibited
having each play a different sport, so each gender had half a class
period. During this half, the other gender would sit along the side
and watch.</p><p class="standard">	The
girls went first. Mariko got Ai on her basketball team. Unfortunately
it didn't seem Ai was very good at sports. She kept fumbling the
ball.</p><p class="standard">	"Hey,
new girl, learn to catch!" one of the other girls, Vanna
Williams, snapped at her.</p><p class="standard">	"I-I'm
sorry....I'm not very good at...."</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
get good! We're falling behind!"</p><p class="standard">	Ai
was getting much better reviews on the sidelines from the boys, who
were concentrating on shapely legs exposed by her blue gym shorts.
The PE teacher couldn't seem to peel his eyes off her.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
was concentrating on something else. He watched Mariko to see what
she would do. <i>Defend Ai, or ditch her? Or support Vanna…that
would be worst of all.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>Mariko
had approached Ai and was conferring with her privately. Yuji felt
his opinion of her rise a bit. 
</p><p class="standard">	When
the game started again, Mariko's team took the ball in the jump-off.
Vanna Williams passed to Margo Hall, who passed around Bonnie Jacobs
to Mariko. Mariko took off towards the basket, dribbling and spinning
like one of the cartoons in athletic shoe commercials. Lois Snapdoff
came up to stop her. Mariko passed around her towards the three-point
line. 
</p><p class="standard">	No
one was guarding Ai. She scooped up the ball easily. Lois Snapdoff
and Carla Wise hadn't even begun to think about blocking her before
Mariko had darted around their backs. Ai tossed the ball to Mariko,
who grabbed it and jumped up, sinking a basket.</p><p class="standard">	<i>She's
fast, </i>Yuji thought. <i>I bet she really could've caught the guy
who stole her watch this morning if the crowd hadn't been in her way.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>The
teacher blew the whistle to end the game; it was the boys' turn now.
Playing basketball was the last thing Yuji wanted to do at the
moment. He hated sports.</p><p class="standard">	The
other team won the jump-off. As usual Yuji stayed back, trying to
keep away from the center of attention, the ball. He succeeded until
Marc Antonio, the other team's hotshot, ran past him. He shoved Yuji
in the stomach, yelling, "Get outta my way man!" as he
dribbled the ball past.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
was so annoyed he didn't even think, he just reacted. He took off
after Antonio and was on him in a second. Antonio tried to fake him
by thrusting the ball at his face. Yuji slammed his forehead into it,
knocking it from Antonio's grip, then swatted it away so Antonio
couldn't take it back. He had grabbed it and taken off towards the
other end of the court before Antonio could take more than a step
towards it. 
</p><p class="standard">	Antonio's
teammate Bradley came up to guard Yuji. Yuji threw the ball around
him on the left and ducked under him on his right, meeting the ball
again on the other side. He did the same to Watson, tossing the ball
between the stocky boy's legs and feinting to the right, then passing
on the left.</p><p class="standard">	<i>Stop
this! Stop!</i></p><p class="standard">	Yuji
saw one of his teammates from the corner of his eye. He passed the
ball and sank back. <i>I shouldn't have lost control.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	Well,
he pissed me off.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	So
does Butch Christensen, but you watch him rob some kid every day
without doing anything.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>The
PE teacher blew the whistle signaling the end of class. The girls
shuffled off to auditorium, with the boys following. The girls
changed on stage with the curtain down; the boys changed amidst the
chairs.</p><p class="standard">	The
teacher stopped Yuji as he was leaving. "What was that,
Watanabe?"<br />	"What do you mean?" Yuji asked.</p><p class="standard">	"You've
been holding back this whole time!"</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
yeah....well, I don't know. Just lucky. I couldn't do it again."</p><p class="standard">	"You
should try out for the basketball team!"</p><p class="standard">	"No,
really, Mr. Brown, I couldn't do that again. It was a fluke, that's
all."</p><p class="standard">	He
left the teacher raving to himself and went to change for his last
class.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji's
last class was Social Studies. He found it a compelling subject, and
he usually paid attention, even if the method of teaching it was less
Socratic and more Stalinist.</p><p class="standard">	"....now,
remember that the Japanese creation myth contains echoes of the
Babylonian one in that both see the primordial world as an ocean."</p><p class="standard">	<i>Plus
a god-father and a god-mother symbolically get it on in both, </i>Yuji
thought.</p><p class="standard">	"Some
have used this as evidence for a relationship between the Sumerian
and Japanese languages. The similarity both to Sumerian and to the
Elvish languages was used for nationalistic purposes during the war.
At the war's start in 1914, the United States had blockaded the Outer
Rim to ensure the elves offered no aid to the Japanese. Now, does
anyone know the meaning of the word 'nationalism?'"</p><p class="standard">	No
one volunteered, so the teacher explained. "Basically, it's the
belief that your own nation is the greatest and should rule the
others. Some rulers in Europe use it against the United States, but
no serious scholar will back up those claims. The difference between
wartime Japan and America is a perfect example of the difference
between nationalism and patriotism. In America, we're proud of
building a free democracy where everyone is equal. In wartime Japan,
they were proud of themselves just for being Japanese. They believed
themselves to be the combined stock of the most ancient humans in the
Grand Zone and the elves of the Outer Rim."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
couldn't resist; he raised his hand. "Yes, Mr. Watanabe?"</p><p class="standard">	"The
Japanese <i>are </i>from elven stock."</p><p class="standard">	There
was a low murmur from the rest of the class; challenging the teacher
was something they'd never seen before.</p><p class="standard">	"True,
Mr. Watanabe, but to suggest this makes them superior to all other
races...."</p><p class="standard">	"But
you said 'they believed.' There wasn't any belief involved; it was
scientifically proven. You can say they were wrong to do what they
did on the basis of that knowledge, but you can't say the knowledge
itself was incorrect."</p><p class="standard">	The
teacher looked at him sourly. "You're Japanese and half-Irish,
correct Mr. Watanabe?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes."</p><p class="standard">	"Then
you really can't be expected to understand how it felt back then."</p><p class="standard">	"Bringing
the Irish into this doesn't change anything. I understand the Irish
were mistreated by the Americans and the British, even though they
also have elven blood."</p><p class="standard">	The
teacher pointed at the door. "Please leave, Mr. Watanabe. Come
back when you're willing to be cooperative."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
stood up and left, aware of all eyes on him. He stood outside the
door for a moment. <i>Maybe I went too far.</i></p><p class="standard">	He
reentered after about five minutes. "Do you have something to
say to me, Mr. Watanabe?" the teacher asked.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
had intended to come in, sit down, and shut up. Now the teacher was
pulling this crap. "Yes," he said calmly. "You're a
tool of the government. An indoctrinator of young minds."</p><p class="standard">	The
teacher turned beet-red. "Mr. Watanabe, go to the office! I'm
tired of dealing with you!"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shrugged. He turned and left the room.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	He
didn't go to the office. He put his books in his locker and sat on a
bench outside until school got out.</p><p class="standard">	When
the last bell rang, the doors opened and a teeming mass of pimpled
faces came streaming out. They trudged toward the gate like a herd of
sheep.</p><p class="standard">	Two
faces in the mass were blemish-free, and these two separated out and
came towards Yuji. "Hey, Watanabe!" said Mariko. "Whatcha
doin' out here?"</p><p class="standard">	"Never
mind," he answered. "How'd your first day go, Ai?"</p><p class="standard">	Ai
smiled. "It went well, thanks to you and Mariko. I'm really glad
I met you."</p><p class="standard">	"Turns
out me and Ai live in the same neighborhood, so we're going home
together," said Mariko. "Wanna come?"</p><p class="standard">	"Where
is it?"</p><p class="standard">	"Proastio
Heights." That was southeast of town, on the other side of the
park from Yuji's neighborhood. The elevated train ran in a loop
around the park, so it was further along the same route. Out of his
way.</p><p class="standard">	"Sure."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	Rush
hour didn't really get going until five, and school got out at four,
so the ride home was never as bad as the ride there. The three of
them actually managed to find seats next to each other.</p><p class="standard">	"Hey,
Ai. You said you lived in Japan. What made you move here?" Yuji
asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Oh…well,
my mother wanted to live somewhere less crowded and hectic than
Kyoto. A smaller city. So, um, we moved here."</p><p class="standard">	"Is
your dad around?" Mariko asked.</p><p class="standard">	"My
mom and dad are still together, but my dad and my brothers are in
America doing a job."</p><p class="standard">	The
train clacked on its rails for a moment. Yuji stared through the
window across from them, watching the city go by. "Does it make
you uncomfortable?" 
</p><p class="standard">	Ai
looked at him quizzically. <i>There's a look for her. Wide-eyed with
that innocent head-tilt. </i>"That we call you by your first
name," he explained. "I didn't think of that until now, but
in Japan, you'd be 'Maeda-san', huh."</p><p class="standard">	"Really?"
asked Mariko. "Sorry, I had no idea. It's the Australian in me."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
shook her head. "It's all right. I....I've lived in countries
like that. Actually, I....I don't like my last name very much."</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't blame you. Your first name is much prettier," Mariko
agreed.</p><p class="standard">	She
blushed. The train began to slow. The com system announced,
"Sakurameshi Lane, Next Stop Sakurameshi Lane." That was
Yuji's stop.</p><p class="standard">	He
stayed in his seat and waited for the train to get going.</p><p class="standard">	When
the com system announced "Proastio Heights, Katalixi Street.
Next Stop Proastio Heights, Katalixi Street," they got off the
train.</p><p class="standard">	Katalixi
Street was a cul-de-sac where families with too much money acted out
the TV show 'Wretched Homemakers' with affairs, treachery, and $4000
flat-panel TVs. After acting out the show in real life, they used the
TVs to watch it and get more ideas.</p><p class="standard">	Classic
suburbia.</p><p class="standard">	Ai's
house came first. The garden outside was very well kept. The lawn was
pure green, with no brown spots. There were no weeds or rodent holes,
and it lacked the ridiculous lawn gnomes many of the houses had. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
here it is," she said. "Thank you for walking me home."</p><p class="standard">	"Sure,"
said Mariko. "And if you ever need anything—directions,
homework help, surrounded by Schlemiels and need 'em busted up—just
call me or Yuji-boy."</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,"
Yuji agreed. "Anything. Er, except that last one. You might want
to call the cops for that."</p><p class="standard">	"Thank
you so much." She bowed	low, then went up the garden path into
the house.</p><p class="standard">	"Asked
her out yet?" Mariko inquired as they continued on.</p><p class="standard">	"No.
And I'm not going to. So go ahead, if you're interested."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
laughed. "I don't swing that way, but thanks. Your friend Allen
seems interested, though."</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
well, he's interested in anything with long hair and a lumpy chest,
regardless of what else is there." Yuji thought of the man he'd
seen yesterday, dressed in women's clothing. 
</p><p class="standard">	"And
what are you interested in?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shrugged. "Ink. Paint. Programming. I like a girl with her
zeroes and ones in all the right places."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
so you're shy! Shy, shy, shy! Admit it, you're afraid of girls."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
not running in fear from you, am I?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
I have that effect on people!" She stopped in front of a
two-story house with a balcony on the upper floor. It was painted
bright yellow. "Anyway, here's my stop."</p><p class="standard">	"Are
you....one of the Banana Splits?"</p><p class="standard">	"Funny
boy. I can do without the cracks about the paint color."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
smiled. "All right. See you tomorrow, I guess." Mariko
waved as she approached the front porch.</p><p class="standard">	Once
she was inside, Yuji turned to take the train back to Sakurameshi
Lane. He realized he hadn't thought once about the divorce all day.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard"><i>It's

        <p class="standard">	"You're
back tomorrow?" Allen asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,"
said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Who'd've
thought? You, getting suspended."</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah."</p><p class="standard">	"It's
the <i>symbollica brutallae </i>of our age."</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah."</p><p class="standard">	"Do
you know what that means?"</p><p class="standard">	"No."</p><p class="standard">	"It's
Latin. It means 'symbol of brutality.'"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
looked up from his contemplation of the lake. "I've never heard
that in my life."</p><p class="standard">	"You
should've shown up for class, man."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	"Do
you know how Ai and Mariko are doing?" Yuji asked. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Hey
man, you're not gonna believe this! Ai found a boyfriend!"</p><p class="standard">	"Who
is it?" Yuji asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Butch
Christensen."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
couldn't believe it. "The same Butch Christensen who robs one of
the members of your chess club on a daily basis? The ROTC goon who
thinks the army's motto is 'Take all that you can take'?"</p><p class="standard">	"The
same. I can't say I admire her taste, but she's got guts to go out
with him. I talked to some of the girls that did. They say he's an
animal in the sack." Allen winked.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
didn't feel like winking. Ai being so near a psychopath like Butch
worried him. He couldn't see how Mariko would let her do it. 
</p><p class="standard">	<i>I'll
have a talk with her tomorrow. </i>Which 'her' didn't matter. Maybe
both of them needed to be talked to.</p><p class="standard">	</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
left at six forty-four the next morning. He hated getting up early
and walking ten minutes to get on a packed train. As usual neither
seat nor strap was free, but there was no danger of falling over
since he was surrounded by enough people to grind up and feed the
entire population of Monaco for eight years.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
had two Mai Serifu doujinshi for Allen in his backpack: 'Doutei Uke
ni Majô', a _ _ _holic doujin about the Toki Uchuu ni Majô
and 'Bits of Chocolate', a Chokobitsu doujin about Chiizu and Keiki.
(He wasn't too proud of the title on that one; surely at least twenty
other doujin authors had Chokobitsu books with the same title.) 
</p><p class="standard"><i>	God,
I hate crowds, </i>he thought. <i>Okay,
a song. A song. Let's see, um.... Ravin d'Etre sonna uchuu ni, Ravin
d'Etre chigau you ni, hohoende, sagashite, nagareta kawa nante?</i>
He couldn't remember the rest of the words, so he switched to
Polytonic Orthography's 'Samui Skopevtis' until he caught sight of
someone who looked familiar.</p><p class="standard">	It
was a boy a few years older than him. He was acne-riddled and his
hair gelled into spikes like any other teenage boy. He wore a black
T-shirt that read 'My Brain is FUBAR' over an orange long-sleeved
shirt. Yuji was sure he'd seen him before. He watched the boy for a
minute.</p><p class="standard">	The
boy noticed. "Wha'chu lookin' at?"</p><p class="standard">	"Nothing,"
Yuji said quickly. He looked away, but kept the boy on the periphery
of his sight. The boy took out a bronze pocket watch. There was a
wolf engraved on the cover above an inscription. Yuji couldn't make
it out. He waited until the guy was focused on the watch and looked
closely.</p><p class="standard">	The
inscription read 'To Mariko, from Alex'.</p><p class="standard">	<i>That's
Mariko's watch! It has to be! </i>
</p><p class="standard">	"Excuse
me," said Yuji. "Where did you get that watch?"</p><p class="standard">	"Wha'chu
mean where I get it? I bought it!" 
</p><p class="standard">	"Really?
How much was it?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
don' know man. Leave me alone."</p><p class="standard">	"Because
that's an Australian SAS watch. Only commanders in the SAS get one of
those. So they're probably worth about eight hundred dollars, at
least. Is your name Mariko?"</p><p class="standard">	"You
a freak, man," the guy scoffed. He turned around to wade out of
the car. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
placed a hand on his shoulder and he stopped. "I asked if your
name was Mariko. Now tell me."</p><p class="standard">	"I
don' know no Mary-whats—"</p><p class="standard">	"Really?"
The crowd surrounding Yuji dispersed. They didn't want to be in the
way. "Because an acquaintance, a Mariko Takahashi, had one of
those stolen recently—on this train. So
why don't you give that to me right now?"</p><p class="standard">	"Wha'chu
talkin' 'bout fool?" The guy turned around, raising his hands as
if he planned to fight.</p><p class="standard">	"I'd
rather not fight over it," said Yuji. "If we do, the cops
get involved. Just give it to me and we'll end this."</p><p class="standard">	"You—"
The guy raised his fists. Yuji's right hand flew up and seized the
watch; his left hand seized the guy's wrist and his fingers sank into
the pressure point. The punk's fingers gave way and let the watch
into Yuji's. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Oww!"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
let him go. "Thank you."</p><p class="standard">	"You
crazy man! I'm gettin' the cops! They gon' beat yo' ass!"</p><p class="standard">	"Okay.
That's fine. I'm sure they'll be interested in this incident."</p><p class="standard">	The
guy stared at Yuji for a second looking utterly stupid. Then he
turned and stalked off to another car.</p><p class="standard">	The
people kept a wide berth around him the rest of the trip, and that
was fine. It gave Yuji a chance to look over the watch. He opened it.
Inside the cover was a date and two words scratched in with a knife:
<i>6/4/23: Never Forget!!! </i>Below it was engraved <i>To Mariko,
from Grandpa Alex</i>.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
closed the watch, feeling satisfied.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	As
soon as he got off the train, he began to search for Mariko. He
spotted her walking up ahead, wearing strange things again. This time
it was a denim skirt with matching vest and an outback hat. She
carried a beat-up army knapsack, like some outback wanderer.</p><p class="standard">	"Hey!"
Yuji yelled. "Mariko! Mariko Takahashi!"</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
turned her head. "Yuji!" She waded through the crowd to get
to him. "You got suspended? For arguing with Mr. Brown about
homework?"</p><p class="standard">	"Is
that what they told you?" He told her the true story. He was
surprised when she laughed.</p><p class="standard">	"Good
one! Well, how've you been doing?"</p><p class="standard">	"Not
bad, I guess. I had Allen bring my work over for me. You?"</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
grand."</p><p class="standard">	"What
about Ai? I heard she has a boyfriend."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko's
grin immediately disappeared. "Oh, yeah. Well, I guess if he
makes her happy. But y'know, it's strange. She seemed like such a
sweet kid. I didn't think she'd go for that type. And he seems a
little old for her."</p><p class="standard">	"I
think maybe we're not seeing the whole picture." The two of them
fell into the flow, moving with the crowd towards the street. "By
the way, I've got a surprise for you."</p><p class="standard">	"What?"
Mariko asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Remember
that watch you lost? Is this it?"</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
took the watch and looked it over. "My god! This is the one that
got stolen! Where'd you find it?"</p><p class="standard">	"Laying
around. The guy who took it must have dropped it." Yuji laughed.
"I'm lying. Actually, I met the guy and took it back."</p><p class="standard">	"Ha!
Good one. He tried to fight you, huh?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah.
But my fists of fury outmatched him."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
went into his Science class and found Ai already sitting at their
table. "Good morning," he said shortly.</p><p class="standard">	"Oh....Good
morning, Mr. Watanabe," she responded. Her new boyfriend showed
in her jungle-print camouflage shirt, an airman's pin at her collar.
<i>So she's really into this army crap, huh?</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>"Heard
you're going out with someone."</p><p class="standard">	"What?
Oh, yes. Butch. He's—he's a good guy.
I-I like him a lot."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
nodded "Uh-huh." He wanted to say something. Like how Butch
Christensen robbed anyone he could intimidate. Like how he'd been up
on rape charges in Yuji's first year here. Of course they'd been
cleared—of course they had been. Or how kids were more scared
of the ROTC than of the Schlemiels, who sometimes fought ROTC, though
they mostly stuck to fighting the other Jewish gangs. 
</p><p class="standard">	He
opened his mouth to say something.</p><p class="standard">	"Class,
please open your books to Chapter 57, 'Why Desert Plants would Die if
you Gave them Drugs,'" interrupted the teacher, and Yuji didn't
say anything.</p><p class="standard">	He
didn't say anything to her for the rest of the day.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
scowled at a paper bowl containing some sort of crumbling Styrofoam
packet filled with baloney and a sticky yellow substance everyone
assumed was cheese. The 'menu' claimed it was called a 'Passion
Pocket'. Since the 'menu' had only one dish, it was really more of an
'announcement'. Allen was devouring his with apparent relish.</p><p class="standard">	"Something
wrong? You're not eating."</p><p class="standard">	"Do
I ever?"</p><p class="standard">	"Good
point."</p><p class="standard">	They
were silent for a moment, staring at people moving past and moving to
the slop line and moving to the doors to the outside, and moving with
girlfriends and moving with boyfriends. In a back corner Butch
Christensen urged his new girlfriend to lean on Raine Yurikson, the
Chess Club's one female member, for her three dollars of bus fare and
lunch money.</p><p class="standard">	"You
gonna do something?"</p><p class="standard">	"About
what?"</p><p class="standard">	"Kilimanjaro.
Look at her. She's bullying Raine."</p><p class="standard">	It
didn't look like that at all to Yuji. It looked more like Butch was
bullying his girlfriend who was trying to bully Raine. The net result
seemed fairly pathetic.</p><p class="standard">	"He's
just using her so he can take Raine's money for once instead of
squeezing the guys dry," said Yuji. He hacked off a piece of
Passion Pocket with his spork and downed it whole. It wasn't too bad
that way, though the 'cheese' still left a urine aftertaste.</p><p class="standard">	"And
that's all right?"</p><p class="standard">	"Look,
what d'you want me to do?!" Yuji snapped. Allen recoiled. Yuji
subsided. "Of course it's not all right with me, but it's what
happens. Girls choose bad guys. They do bad stuff. If I go beat up
Butch Christensen, will they stop?"</p><p class="standard">	Allen
paused. "Look man, I know you're wrong—"</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
not wrong. Shut up and drop it."</p><p class="standard">	"You
<i>are </i>wrong, but I don't know how. Give me some time to think."</p><p class="standard">	"Dammit,
Allen!" Yuji threw his half-eaten Passion Pocket with all his
strength. It sailed across the room and landed right in the trashcan.
"If I beat him....if I <i>kill </i>him....how does that help
anyone? It makes you feel better because you don't have to watch your
Chess Club members get robbed. Butch clearly loses, and what's in it
for me? Do something yourself, or shut up."</p><p class="standard">	Allen,
usually even-tempered, stood up. "Fine. This isn't like you,
man. You're not Yuji, you're some new jerk. So when Yuji comes back,
have him call me." He turned and left.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
fumed for a moment. He tore open his carton of nonfat milk with his
teeth and gulped down the hateful whitewash. <i>You didn't have to
yell at him.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	Shut
up!</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	He's
right, you're not being yourself. </i>
</p><p class="standard"><i>	Who
I am changes from second to second. The me who was into all that
chivalry crap is gone. This is me now, like it or not.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	Believe
me, I don't.</i></p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
called home from the payphone in the train station. <i>"Hi, this
is Jewel Denbigh. My children Yuji and Shoko are also here. If you
want one of us, please leave a message at the beep and we'll call you
back as soon as we can."</i></p><p class="standard">	"Hi
Mom, it's Yuji. I'm gonna be a little late. I should be back in time
for dinner. Talk to you then." 
</p><p class="standard">	He
hung up the phone and went to the park, spacing out as he walked.
<i>God, what a parade of never-ending fun. Mom and Dad get divorced
for no apparent reason. This girl. I think she's my friend and then
she starts hanging out with Butch Christensen the ROTC goon. Allen.
He doesn't understand anything.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	Kill
Butch Christensen.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>Yuji
shook his head.</p><p class="standard">	<i>Kill
him.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>No.</p><p class="standard">	<i>Kill
Allen. Kill the girl.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>No.</p><p class="standard">	This
was why Yuji needed to go to the park. He needed to sit, surrounded
by falling cherry blossoms, and clear his head.</p><p class="standard">	He
entered the park through the high <i>torii </i>shrine gate that
marked the west entrance and followed the path to the bridge. A small
tributary of the River Vishnya ran down into the lake. In summer, the
bridge area was a prime spot to see fireflies.</p><p class="standard">	The
path continued to Yuji's left. He crossed it and went off into the
trees. It was dark and cool in the thicket, with a musty smell.</p><p class="standard">	When
he thought about it, he realized he should have seen her from a mile
away. There was enough sun coming through the cherry trees that her
hair should've lit up like a signal flare. But he was caught unawares
when he came up the hill and found the girl there, her head down, her
face on her knees. She was crying.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
thought about leaving, but when he turned to go the leaves rustled
and the girl looked up. "Oh....um, hi...." she said
awkwardly.</p><p class="standard">	"Hi."</p><p class="standard">	Her
face was stained with tears, her eyes and nose red. Long inkwash
streams of mascara were absent; she must not have been wearing
makeup. He sat down next to her. She'd switched the camouflage-print
shirt for her PE shirt.</p><p class="standard">	"Didn't
have time to change?" he asked.</p><p class="standard">	"No.
I just put my skirt on over my shorts."</p><p class="standard">	"Does
it hurt?"</p><p class="standard">	"What?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
pointed to the throbbing weal on her ankle. He hadn't noticed until
he'd sat down next to her.</p><p class="standard">	"Oh....no.
Actually, I....I hadn't even noticed."</p><p class="standard">	They
sat in silence for a moment, watching the boats go by. "Hey....Mr.
Watanabe....Have you ever read <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i>?"</p><p class="standard">	"No."</p><p class="standard">	"It's
about a future society based on the biblical story of Rachel and
Leah. Where women serve as handmaids for a Christian state called
Gilead."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
surprised you learned biblical stories in Japan."</p><p class="standard">	"My
brother Xenophon is Christian. He had me read the story so I could
learn something."</p><p class="standard">	"What
did you learn?"</p><p class="standard">	She
daubed her eyes with a pink handkerchief. Yuji saw a small Hello
Kitty face embroidered on the corner. "Context is all." She
stood up. "Please don't tell anyone about this."</p><p class="standard">	"I
won't. On one condition. Come back here every day. I'll be waiting
here."</p><p class="standard">	She
nodded, and almost smiled. "I will. Please excuse me."</p><p class="standard">	Once
she was gone, Yuji took out his wallet and checked how much money he
had. There was just enough for another game. After paying for a
gondola, he wouldn't be able to afford tax. 
</p><p class="standard">	<i>Maybe
I could buy it</i><i>—</i> Then he
realized he felt fine. He didn't need to buy anything. He got up and
went home.</p><p class="standard">	Allen
accosted Yuji the next morning. "You in there, Yuji-boy, or is
the new jerk still hanging around?"</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
not going to beat him up," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	They
didn't hang out that day. Allen hung out with Miles Prower and
Algernon Chibodee from the Chess Club. Yuji spent lunch alone and
recess reading at a picnic table. He didn't talk to her either,
except to say hello in Science. She wore army clothes again. 	He
thought about talking to Mariko, but every time he saw her she was
with a girl whose name he didn't know. She was plain, bespectacled
and freckled. Her features weren't unattractive on their own, with
her shoulder-length chocolate brown hair as her best feature, but an
ugly scowl seemed permanently etched on her face. Even when she
laughed, that scowl never left her eyes.</p><p class="standard">	After
school Yuji went to the lake and found her there again. She wasn't
crying this time; she looked pensive. Again she had taken off her
camouflage shirt and put on her gym shirt.</p><p class="standard">	"Mr.
Watanabe, have you ever read <i>The Mists of Avalon</i>?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes."
He'd gone on an Arthurian kick two years ago and read every novel
ever written, from the <i>Morte d'Arthur </i>and <i>Idylls of the
King </i>to <i>Detective King Arthur </i><i>in the 22</i><sup><i>nd</i></sup><i>
Century.</i></p><p class="standard">	"What
do you think it was about? Really, I mean?"<br />	He thought about
it. "I think it was about duty. And freedom. And how some duties
only exist in our own minds. But they keep us sane. They keep us from
giving up."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
good. I hadn't thought of that. But some characters fail their
duties. They go insane."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shook his head. "They accomplished their duties from the
writer's point of view."</p><p class="standard">	She
smiled. "You're right, of course. I should have thought of that
too."</p><p class="standard">	"You
seem to read a lot," Yuji commented. "Do you write?"</p><p class="standard">	"Not
really."</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't see how you do that. I started reading manga and six months
later I started drawing. I was no good at first, but I couldn't rest
until I could draw like that."</p><p class="standard">	"Can
you do it now?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
nodded. "It's not quite like what I expected."</p><p class="standard">	"Can
I see sometime?"</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
most of what I draw is 18-and-over, so...."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh."
She turned red. "You're that kind of artist."</p><p class="standard">	"But
I could do something that isn't," he said quickly. "Er, how
about right now?" He took his pencil and sketchbook from his
backpack. "Just stay like that."</p><p class="standard">	"What
are you doing?" she asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Just
hold still. This'll only take a minute." He began to sketch.
Yuji always enjoyed the way his hands moved when he was drawing—long,
graceful strokes that captured the girl's neckline, the curves of her
cheekbones, the folds in her clothes, the flowing of her hair. When
it was finished, he showed it to her and she blushed.</p><p class="standard">	"Do
you really think I look like this?"</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
yeah," Yuji answered, rubbing his neck abashedly.</p><p class="standard">	"It's
so pretty. I wish I had a talent like that." She handed the book
back to him. "I'd better get home. Please excuse me."</p><p class="standard">	"Tomorrow?"</p><p class="standard">	"Urm....I'd
better not. I had something planned tomorrow."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
okay. I guess I'll see you 'round, then."</p><p class="standard">	She
nodded and turned to go, but then she stopped. "Urm, can I ask
you a favor?"</p><p class="standard">	"What
is it?"</p><p class="standard">	"Could
I....have that drawing?"</p><p class="standard">	<i>Is
she worried I'll use it for a doujin? </i>"Well, I'd never do
anything weird with it...."</p><p class="standard">	"No,
that's not what I'm worried about!" She blushed again. "I
just....I'd like to have it."</p><p class="standard">	He
gave it to her.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	He
gave no sign in Science the next morning. As they opened to Chapter
67, <i>Why Drugs Make 69 Less Fun</i>, he said nothing.</p><p class="standard">	She
was glad for that. Even their exchange of greetings would be
dangerous if Butch ever heard about it. He was protective of her, and
if he heard about her talking to another boy, he would take it the
wrong way.</p><p class="standard">	She
sat with him and the other ROTC members at lunch. There was one other
girl. Her name was Olga, and she was more of a boy than some of the
boys. Olga had no sympathy for her.</p><p class="standard">	The
other boys were called Jack, Richie, and Clinqenfus. Jack Merridew
was a tall, lanky boy whose physique was similar to Yuji's. Richie
Lagosta was average-sized. Clinqenfus, whose last name she had never
discovered, was huger and more monstrous than even Butch. All five of
them had buzz-cuts and usually wore camouflage pants and white
T-shirts. 
</p><p class="standard">	"'Jou
do 'at homework ol' man Crackstein give?" asked Richie.</p><p class="standard">	"Nah.
Don't got no use for dat. When I get out, I'm goin' in the US
Marines."</p><p class="standard">	"Me
neither."</p><p class="standard">	"Stupids,
you get higher ranked in the Marines if you does good in school,"
said Butch. "Which reminds me—you
got my homework?"</p><p class="standard">	She
looked up. "Excuse me?"</p><p class="standard">	"Homework
I ast ya t'do bitch! It's real important—you
don' wanna be d'reason I flunk out, do ya?"</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
yes, yes, I have it. Just....give me a moment." She opened her
bag and began to dig around inside, but there were too many papers so
she began to take them out and set them on the table.</p><p class="standard">	In
the middle of looking, Butch suddenly interrupted her with, "Wha's
dis?"</p><p class="standard">	She
looked up and realized she'd taken out the drawing of herself that
Yuji had done yesterday. "Um....it's a self-portrait. I did it
in Art."</p><p class="standard">	Olga
had taken the drawing and begun to inspect it. "Dis Jap comics."</p><p class="standard">	"You
can' draw no Jap comics. Actually, you can' draw nothin'...."
said Butch.</p><p class="standard">	"No,
it's true, I—"</p><p class="standard">	"Shuddap!"
He slapped her. "Someone did 'is for ya. That's jes' for lyin'
about it—there'll be more when I find
out who it is."</p><p class="standard">	"Butch,
you know who's always got this Jappo comics crap? Allen Sternheim,"
said Olga.</p><p class="standard">	Butch
grinned. "Little Alice Sternheim and her Jappo comics. She's
went too far 'is time. Boys, after school we's gonna teach little
Alice a lesson he'll never forget."</p><p class="standard">	Olga
cackled and cracked her knuckles. Ai shivered.</p><p class="standard">	Butch
turned his attention back to her. "Now listen, you. Ya don't go
seein' some guy behind my back. Especially not lil' Alice Sternheim.
Got me?"</p><p class="standard">	"Y-yes,"
Ai stammered. <i>I....I hate being like this....I....</i></p><p class="standard">	Butch
made a grab for her hand. On reflex she pulled away and he slapped
her again. "Don'chu pull away!" He made a grab and this
time she let him, knowing there was nothing she could do but suffer
through it.</p><p class="standard">	Butch
took her index finger. "This 'ere's a little somethin' they
showed us in ROTC for when someone don't wanna tell ya what he
knows...." He slowly began to bend it back. She clenched her
teeth as he bent it back, back, back, and the pain mounted, and she
closed her eyes until finally she heard it snap.</p><p class="standard">	"That'll
show ya. Now swear ya won't never hang out with little Alice again."</p><p class="standard">	"....I....I
swear," she whimpered. She didn't dare look at her pinky.</p><p class="standard">	"Good.
Now we'll make sure lil' Alice knows the same...."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	The
last thing Yuji had expected as he left school was for Ai to run
after him, screaming his name and waving her bag above her head. As
she approached, he noticed her right hand was wrapped in bandages.</p><p class="standard">	"Mr.
Watanabe, Mr. Watanabe! Thank god you haven't left yet, it's
important, there's—"</p><p class="standard">	"Hey,
calm down," said Yuji. "I thought you didn't want anyone at
school to know we were talking."</p><p class="standard">	"It
doesn't matter anymore, Butch knows, but he doesn't know it's you, he
found the drawing, he thinks it's Mr. Sternheim—"</p><p class="standard">	"He
thinks it's <i>Allen</i>?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
yes, and they've taken him out back in the field over the canal,
and—"</p><p class="standard">	"What
happened to your hand?" Yuji interrupted.</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
well, I fell on it, and—"</p><p class="standard">	"Never
mind. I think I already know." He needed time to think. <i>The
teachers won't help, not after school. The cops won't either. If
there even are any nearby. Who can I....?</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	No
one, Yuji. There's no one you can foist this on, and no way you can
rationalize doing nothing. Like it or not, you've got to.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	"Got
to" nothing! If someone else dies—</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	Better
him than Allen. Or Ai.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>That
was the sort of person Butch Christensen was. The sort Yuji had been.
The sort for whom things could quickly get out of hand. And unlike
Yuji, he wouldn't suffer a day for it. Not even if he went to prison.</p><p class="standard">	Which
he wouldn't. Not with his military contract.</p><p class="standard">	"Come
with me," said Yuji. Ai looked at him quizzically. <i>Cute as
ever. Cute enough to scream over. </i>He looked at her bandaged hand,
then the one without. <i>Her hands are so small and delicate.
Breaking one'd be like strangling a kitten. </i>"This won't be
pretty, but I'm doing it for you as well as Allen. And I don't want
you to get the wrong idea about it."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	"I
never touched her!" Allen protested, earning him another fist in
the stomach from Butch.</p><p class="standard">	"Shaddup!
I found the Jappo comics crap you draw in 'er bag!"</p><p class="standard">	"I
can't draw! Ask Yuji, maybe he—"
This earned him another fist. He crumpled over and fell down into a
sitting position in the waist-high dead crabgrass.</p><p class="standard">	"So
'im an' 'is faggo partner 'ad a threesome with 'er," said Olga,
who was obviously having fun. 
</p><p class="standard">	Butch
punched Allen in the face, hard enough to give him a bloody nose, but
not as hard as it could've been. "You screw 'er fag? Little
Alice Sternheim stick his pin in a girl? Or 'id that Jap fag you hang
with give it to both of ya?"</p><p class="standard">	"What
do you think the Marines do when they need to get off? Not many
hookers in the jungle."</p><p class="standard">	Butch
and his four cronies turned around. It was like a dream come true.
Jappo Wannabe was here, and he'd brought the Jappo bitch that Butch
had been hoping to sleep with. Everyone involved had come to get
their punishment.</p><p class="standard">	"Leave
Allen alone," said Yuji with quiet authority. "He didn't
draw the picture. I did."</p><p class="standard">	"Olga,
Clinqenfus, why don't ya get started on Jappo Wannabe and let us
finish up on lil' Alice," said Butch.</p><p class="standard">	Olga
and Clinqenfus approached Yuji, both grinning. He stared back. "I
don't usually like to hit girls, but...."</p><p class="standard">	"Shuddap,
Jap fag!"</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't think you qualify as one, so...."</p><p class="standard">	Olga
shrieked and launched herself at him. Yuji dodged her punch easily.
She threw two haymakers that made the air whistle and kicked at him
with her general-issue boots. Yuji avoided all three.</p><p class="standard">	Clinqenfus
came down on Yuji's right side, an inch and a half taller than him
and a hundred pounds heavier. Yuji ducked between them. Both turned
around and tried to grab him. He avoided, dodged Clinqenfus's punch
and Olga's kick, and launched himself at the latter, grabbing her by
the ankle and forcing her leg up above her head. He heaved her foot
aside, throwing her off balance, then kicked her other foot from
under her, knocking her to the ground. 
</p><p class="standard">	Clinqenfus
ran at him from behind. Yuji gracefully moved aside, tripping the
hurtling behemoth with his trailing foot as he went. Clinqenfus fell
atop Olga, knocking the wind out of her. Yuji stomped on his elbow.
Ai heard it crack and she winced.</p><p class="standard">	"Butch!"
Clinqenfus bellowed.</p><p class="standard">	"No
way! There's no way the Jap Fag took down Olga and Clinqenfus!"
Richie babbled. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Of
course not, he used some cheap trick," said Butch. "He
won't get us!"</p><p class="standard">	"You're
wrong!" Allen cried. "Yuji's an honest-to-god kung
fu-fighter!"</p><p class="standard">	"Shuddap,
Alice!" Butch kicked Allen in the thigh. He, Richie, and Jack
approached more slowly than their companions had.</p><p class="standard">	"Owwwaahh!"
Butch taunted in a high voice, making mystical Power Rangers hand
movements. "C'mon Jap! Come get us with your kung fu!"</p><p class="standard">	"Shuddap,"
said Yuji, parodying Butch.</p><p class="standard">	Jack
and Richie came on first. They jumped at Yuji, trying to tackle him.
Yuji's response was a move Ai would have sworn was impossible; he
revolved and leapt backwards, sailing at them with his back turned.
His left foot went into Jack's stomach; his right elbow went into
Richie's face. He floored the former and broke the latter's nose,
landed on his right foot, and sank his left into the charging Butch's
stomach as a side kick.</p><p class="standard">	Butch
fell to his knees and lost his lunch.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
snapped a quick punch into Butch's jugular and a knifehand into the
base of his skull and pushed him onto his side. He lay in the dead
crabgrass groaning and holding his stomach.</p><p class="standard">	As
soon as Butch was down, Allen came running over. "Yuji! Man!
That was totally awesome! You just like, I mean, wow, you—"</p><p class="standard">	"This
is what I don't want from you," he said to Ai, interrupting
Allen's chatter.</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
yes....Um, d-don't worry, I don't like violence....but I am glad you
decided to help Mr. Sternheim. Um, a-and me o-of course."</p><p class="standard">	All
of a sudden Yuji felt like he was going to lose his lunch too.
"I....have to go to the bathroom. I'll meet you guys outside."</p><p class="standard">	Butch
rolled onto his back as the two Japs and lil' Alice the Jew went
away. "That little....little....bastard....beating me....It's
the <i>symbollica brutallae </i>of 'is age."</p><p class="standard">	"What,
Butch?" moaned Jack.</p><p class="standard">	"Shaddup."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
went into the bathroom and threw up. He felt better after that. 
</p><p class="standard">	<i>I
shouldn't have let myself go. I'll be lucky if Butch doesn't have
brain injuries after how hard I hit him. Of course there isn't much
brain to injure, but....</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	This
was nothing like what happened with Amniya and Jared. That was a
disaster. This turned out okay. Ai and Allen are safe and none of the
ones you fought are seriously hurt.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	What
about tomorrow? What about when Butch and his goons try to get
revenge?</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	Those
two will just have to stick with me for a while, until the heat wears
off. The year is almost over, they'll be out of high school next
year—</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>Yuji
stopped, feeling another wave of nausea. He gagged and heaved and
brought up nothing but bile. He wiped his mouth with a paper towel. 
</p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>He
came outside and was surprised to find Allen not hitting on Ai. In
fact they both looked quite serious; it was unusual, but it made
sense after what had happened.</p><p class="standard">	"Listen,
you two," said Yuji. "Butch and his gang will probably want
revenge, so I want you to stick with me for a while. Allen, don't
come to school until I do. Hang out in Schlesinger's until I come to
get you."</p><p class="standard">	"Whatever
you say, man," said Allen. "You were totally awesome.
Especially that last move where you like, K.O.'d Jack and Richie and
Butch all at the same time!"</p><p class="standard">	"I
won't need to worry for a while," said Ai, smiling ruefully. She
held up her bandaged hand. "I can't hold a pen. I'll be out for
at least a day."</p><p class="standard">	"Do
you want me to get your schoolwork for you tomorrow?" Yuji
asked.</p><p class="standard">	She
looked surprised. "Um, okay....Thank you."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	"No
way!" Mariko laughed so hard she choked on her Gatorade. Yuji
patted her on the back a few times. When she straightened up she
looked him over and started laughing again.</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't know what's so funny," said Yuji. 
</p><p class="standard">	Allen
came across the field with three ice cream bars. The lunch ladies
sold them under the counter after lunch was over. Technically it was
against school rules, but the students wanted them and the lunch
ladies loved the extra money. Allen came to where Yuji and Mariko
were sitting under the big elm tree and handed the ice cream around.</p><p class="standard">	"We
were just discussing Yuji's daring rescue mission," said Mariko.
"How little Alice Sternheim was on the ground crying, and her
brave, cool, strong boyfriend came and rescued her from the mean ol'
ROTC club." She burst out laughing again, grasping her stomach
and rolling over and nearly dropping her ice cream in the dirt. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
sat back and ate his contemplatively. "I hope Ai's all right."</p><p class="standard">	"What
do you mean? Did you have to pop her one too?" Mariko barely got
the words out before she started laughing again. "Sorry. I
mean....it's just....the thought of <i>you </i>being this bad-ass
martial arts expert! It's too funny!"</p><p class="standard">	"Ai's
finger is broken," said Yuji. Mariko instantly shut up.</p><p class="standard">	"How
did that happen?"</p><p class="standard">	"Butch
broke it when he found my drawing in her bag."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
whistled. "He's a brutal bastard. So that's why she's not in
school."</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah."</p><p class="standard">	Allen
seemed to be concentrating deeply. "You don't look well, Allen,"
said Mariko. "What're you thinking about?"</p><p class="standard">	"Was
the picture a nudie?" he asked at last.</p><p class="standard">	"Does
he have bandage fetish or something?" Mariko asked derisively.</p><p class="standard">	"No.
<i>Aho sae</i>."</p><p class="standard">	<i>"So
ka."</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>"Stop
speaking Japanese! I command that you never again speak Japanese in
my presence."</p><p class="standard">	<i>"Hai,
sugu ni, Allen-sama," </i>(Yes my lord, right away) Yuji
answered sarcastically.</p><p class="standard">	"This
is the way they treat me. Civil rights, shmivil rights."</p><p class="standard">	"You're
certainly whiny for a guy who was never in a death camp or a six-day
war," said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?
Six-day war?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
rolled his eyes. "The skirmishes between Israel and the Arab
countries after the Grand Zone war."</p><p class="standard">	"You
probably don't even know what the swastika stands for," said
Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"Of
course I do! It's a cross twice. It means Jews are twice as cool as
Christians!"</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
shook her head sadly. "Yeah. That's what it means."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	The
train rattled on the tracks. It wasn't as crowded as it was in the
morning since school got out before most people got off work.	Yuji,
Mariko, and Allen were sitting along the left side of the car.
"What're you doing here?" Mariko asked. "I thought you
lived in Midrash Terrace."</p><p class="standard">	"No!
I live on the edge of Dubovy," said Allen. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Why
are you riding the train away from the edge of Dubovy?"</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
I usually walk, but today a lady requires an escort, and when ladies
are in need, Allen Amadeus Sternheim is always here to help."</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't want to walk home with you."</p><p class="standard">	"C'mon,
don't be like that. I'm just being friendly."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
looked at Yuji. "Can I throw him off the train now?"</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
walking him home so Butch and his goons can't jump him," said
Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
laughed. "Little Alice Sternheim needs Sasuke Yujimaru the great
ninja to walk him home."</p><p class="standard">	"Stop
calling me freakin' Alice!" Allen snapped.</p><p class="standard">	She
just grinned.</p><p class="standard">	The
train rattled onward. The three of them watched life go by outside.
"Why do so many people think Allen and I are a couple?"
Yuji asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Why
d'you think I know?"</p><p class="standard">	He
shrugged. She grinned. "You're right, I do know. It's because
he's the only one you hang out with, and you're always alone. Not in
a group."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
thought about that. <i>It's the symbollica brutallae of our age. </i>
</p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>"Hang
out with us then, McKin—I mean, Mariko," said Allen. "If
we have a girl with us, no
one can make any mistakes."</p><p class="standard">	She
shook her head. "I don't want to destroy the mystique and
shatter the fantasy."</p><p class="standard">	"There's
actually a mystique?"</p><p class="standard">	"Girls
fantasize about me?"</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
I guess they're really fantasizing about Yuji....about him whipping
you and making you submit to his every desire...."</p><p class="standard">	"Cut,
cut, cut!"</p><p class="standard">	"You're
a total bottom, Allen."</p><p class="standard">	"A
bottom? What the hell does that mean?"</p><p class="standard">	"In
boys' love manga, the bottom is the submissive end of the
relationship. Y'know....sort of the woman. And the top—that'd
be Yuji-boy here—is the dominant end, sort of the man. And the
top makes the bottom...."</p><p class="standard">	"You're
twisted!"</p><p class="standard">	"Why're
you explaining it like a ghost story?" Yuji asked.</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
shrugged, a lopsided grin on her face. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Those
rumors are totally baseless. If I was gonna go gay, I'd at least
choose someone cuter than him."  
</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
burst out laughing, drawing stares from a cluster of housewives
returning from a shopping trip at the end of the car. "You've
been dumped, Allen! So Yuji, who do you consider cuter than Allen?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't know....Tadaramu Hohori from Gogo Chama, maybe."</p><p class="standard">	"So
you like 'em young, and not too much like a guy. You're a
natural-born top, Yu-Yu."</p><p class="standard">	"C'mon!
I know him well enough to know when he's kidding," said Allen.
"You are kidding, right? You do like girls?"</p><p class="standard">	"No,"
said Yuji. "I don't particularly like girls."</p><p class="standard">	"But
you don't like guys?"</p><p class="standard">	"Not
particularly."</p><p class="standard">	"See?
He's unsexual."</p><p class="standard">	"I
think you mean 'asexual' there, sport," said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"He
has a sex. That means he's not 'asexual.' He's male."</p><p class="standard">	"Can
we stop talking about my sex?" said Yuji. He jerked his head at
the housewives on the end of the car. They were whispering so
furiously they might as well have yelled, and staring and pointing at
them. They seemed to think he was a flasher. "Joke's over."</p><p class="standard">	
The intercom announced, "Proastio Heights, Proastio Heights. All
those bound for Proastio Heights please prepare to exit the train."</p><p class="standard">	"You
guys ever wondered why flashers flash?" Mariko asked. They
disembarked at the Proastio Heights station. The sun was still high
in the sky, but most of the people sat inside watching their
seventy-inch plasma TVs. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Can't
say I have," Yuji answered.</p><p class="standard">	"I
know why," said Allen.</p><p class="standard">	"I
expected you would. Tell me."</p><p class="standard">	"No.
You go first."</p><p class="standard">	"All
right. I think they need to have all the attention focused on them.
They're insecure about themselves, so they need to show everything
off and say 'Look at me! I'm beautiful!'"</p><p class="standard">	"That's
not right at all," said Allen. "They just want what
everyone wants. They want to be loved. They want to find a special
someone who they can show it all to without ever getting made fun of.
But they can't find someone the normal way, so they start trying
desperate measures. The stripped body is just a symbol of the
stripped soul they wish someone would look at."</p><p class="standard">	"Okay...."
Mariko edged over to Yuji. "You kinda freaked me out there,
Ally, but okay."</p><p class="standard">	"What
do you say, Yuji? Who's right?" Allen demanded.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
pondered for a moment. "Both of you are. Mariko's theory is the
reason why they're desperate enough to resort to flashing."</p><p class="standard">	"<i>Itai!
	</i>It's Yujimaru Freud, the Psychiatric Ninja!" Mariko
proclaimed. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
never wanted to talk about it."</p><p class="standard">	"You
know something? I was making all that crap up. That's what high
school cheerleaders who flip up their skirts and show everyone their
panties are thinking. Real, hardcore flashers? They're just nuts. Got
a screw loose."</p><p class="standard">	"What
makes you so smart?" Allen retorted.</p><p class="standard">	"Touchy,
Ally. Whassa matter, you ever wanted to be loved bad enough you
considered flashing someone? Gonna pull it out and show Jane Money
all your glory?"</p><p class="standard">	"He's
moved on to Jolie Rokudo now," Yuji muttered.</p><p class="standard">	"Jolie
Rokudo is a shiksa putz. I'm between girls at the moment, and I still
ask what makes you the flashing know-it-allnik. Maybe you're the one
who's considered showing your rotten apples to Richard Ebing!"</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't go for basketball players, 'specially unco dongas like Ebing,
and if you really want to know, I know 'cause my uncle Brisby's a
clinical necrocelebriphile."</p><p class="standard">	"Neck-row
what?"</p><p class="standard">	"He
wants to root dead celebrities." Yuji noticed Mariko was
slipping into an Australian accent reminiscent of Mel Gibson in <i>Mad
Max</i>. He thought she was doing it on purpose, or at least he hoped
she wasn't using Allen's favorite trick. "Less than one-fiftieth
of Memo's population has it."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
one in every eight thousand people," said Allen defensively. He
wanted to retain some dignity, Yuji could see, and chess and rational
math were his strong suits.</p><p class="standard">	"Right,
but of course my uncle's one of 'em. He wants Marilyn Monroe,
Elizabeth Taylor, and Jane Goodall, and he's enough a drongo to think
he can hit 'em." Mariko sighed, and when she spoke again only a
tinge of the Australian remained. "The old bastard gives me a
headache."</p><p class="standard">	"Jane
Goodall's dead?" asked Allen.</p><p class="standard">	"Jane
Goodall's a celebrity?" asked Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	They
passed by Ai's house, and Mariko said, "Here's Ai's place. Why
don't we stop by and see her? 'We' meaning me and Yuji. You can go
home, Allen."</p><p class="standard">	"No
way, I—She's my friend too!" Allen insisted.</p><p class="standard">	"It
doesn't look like she's home," said Yuji. "There's no car
in the driveway."</p><p class="standard">	"So
her family doesn't have a car. C'mon, Yuji-boy—aren't you
supposed to be delivering her homework? Don't try to squirm out of
it."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shrugged. He rang the bell and waited.</p><p class="standard">	The
door opened, and Ai reared her red-golden head. She was in her
pajamas, white and rose pink. Her eyes were slightly red. She had
gone to the doctor and had her finger wrapped and splinted again.
"Oh....hello, Yuji, Mariko, Allen. I-I didn't expect all of you
to come."</p><p class="standard">	"Of
course we came, we're your friends!" said Mariko. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
please come in...."</p><p class="standard">	"No,
it's all right. We just came to see how you're doing, and drop this
off," Yuji held out a packet of school assignments with copies
of his notes.</p><p class="standard">	"No,
I can't make you come all this way and not at least serve tea."
She opened to door and motioned them inside. With her so insistent,
it would be ruder to refuse than to impose, so Yuji nodded and
entered. 
</p><p class="standard">	"All
right. <i>Shitsurei shimasu</i>." 
</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
don't worry about that....We're not in Japan, and it doesn't bother
me."</p><p class="standard">	"Too
good of ya," said Mariko as she came in.</p><p class="standard">	When
Allen tried to enter—<i>mentally removing her pajamas piece by
piece, no doubt, </i>Yuji thought—Ai stuck out her arm and
barred him. He blinked and stared at her. She nodded firmly.</p><p class="standard">	"All
right, all right. <i>Shitsurei shimasu</i>." She let him in and
closed the door behind him.</p><p class="standard">	The
house's main room was very large, and carpeted all over save for a
small circle of linoleum near the door. The three guests removed
their shoes and Ai guided them to the other end, where two sofas and
five armchairs were organized in a circle around a teak coffee table.

</p><p class="standard">	"It's
just me and my mom here right now, but we have lots of furniture and
rooms because my father and my brothers might be coming, they're in
America right now on work, but—sorry, I'm rambling. I'll get
dressed and make tea. And I think there might be some yatsuhashi."
She went upstairs.</p><p class="standard">	"Man,
I think I lost a few hundred feet of altitude with Kilimanjaro,"
Allen sighed, forgetting Mariko was there.</p><p class="standard">	"Can't
lose whatcha never had," Mariko retorted.</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
at least I got to see her in pajamas."</p><p class="standard">	"Nothing
gets you down, does it?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
was investigating the room. There was no TV, unlike any house he'd
ever seen before. There probably were TVs in the bedrooms, though
with how much Ai seemed to read, it was possible hers was a no-TV
household. The carpet was a pretty cream color. It was probably
difficult to keep clean, but there was no evidence of that; the
entire house was more immaculate nearly as immaculate as  a hospital.
The tall oak bookshelf in the corner was neatly organized and showed
not a speck of dust. There were three Dickens books and two Hemingway
books on the shelf, along with the entire Brontë bibliography
and Keat's <i>Endymion </i>and <i>Hyperion</i>. Ai or her mother
seemed to have a taste for the classics. Amid these were several
linguistic textbooks, including one on the Elven language Mestaera; a
collection of religious texts, including the King James Bible, the
Torah, and the Koran; and a few newer fantasies: <i>The Lord of the
Rings, The Space Book</i>, and <i>Brotherhood of the Wolf</i>, by
David Farland. Yuji had never heard of the last author, and the vivid
cover art was put it out of place alongside the staid solids of the
other books.</p><p class="standard">	"Whatcha
looking for, Yuji-boy? Good places for screwing?" Mariko asked.</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
disappointed, Mariko. That remark was below you."</p><p class="standard">	"You're
right. Accept this one's humble apologies."</p><p class="standard">	"I
was checking out the books."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh.
I don't read much, except for manga."</p><p class="standard">	"I
once read a book you'd like," said Yuji. "<i>Private
Fantasies.</i>"</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
chuckled. "Why were <i>you </i>reading it?"</p><p class="standard">	"Research.
If I ever decide to write a novel, I want to know what not to do."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
returned carrying a tea tray on her forearm and a bag of cookies in
her left hand. "Oh, jeez, sorry," said Mariko, standing up
and taking the tray. 
</p><p class="standard">	"No,
don't worry. Actually, I'm used to carrying trays, so it wasn't hard
to adjust."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
set the tray on the table. Ai poured some of the cookies into a bowl
and offered it around. The tea was real Japanese green tea, light and
fragrant. Yatsuhashi, cinnamon cookies from Kyoto, were Yuji's
favorite. He loved cinnamon, and firmly ascribed to Jerry Seinfeld's
belief that restaurants should put cinnamon on the table alongside
salt and pepper. "Did you get these at that Japanese bakery,
Pan-Pan Ya?" he asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
I'm not sure. My mom got those. But they're good, aren't they?"</p><p class="standard">	"Delicious,"
Allen agreed. He was staring at Ai. She wore a sky-blue skirt and a
white V-necked blouse, but the neck wasn't low enough to show any
cleavage, so Yuji wondered what he was staring at. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Ai?
Are you here?" A pretty thirty-something woman in business dress
came in the door. She was about Mariko's height, but more petite. Her
hair, the same color as Ai's, was bound in a ponytail, and she also
walked with Ai's graceful stride.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
quickly stood up. "Hi Mom. Um, these are my classmates. They
came by to see how I was doing."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
nice of them," the woman said. She bowed to them. "Thank
you for taking care of my daughter. I wasn't sure about her attending
class with older students, but I see I had nothing to worry about.
I'm Sachiko Maeda. Pleased to meet you all."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
thought she was exaggerating a bit; a broken finger seemed like
something to worry about. He frowned and let the other two introduce
themselves first. When he told her his name, she looked at him
curiously. "Yuji Watanabe? Is your father Hiro Watanabe?
Executive manager of R&amp;D at Grantsoft?"</p><p class="standard">	"Do
you know him?" Yuji asked.</p><p class="standard">	"He's
my boss. I took a job as his secretary three weeks ago. He didn't say
anything?"</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
he doesn't talk about work much. Anyway, I'd better get going. Thanks
for the tea and cookies, Ai, and it was good to meet you, Mrs.
Maeda—"</p><p class="standard">	"Ms.,"
she corrected. "I haven't taken the name of Ai's father. Maeda
is my maiden name."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
sorry. Ms. Maeda."</p><p class="standard">	"Are
you sure you can't stay for dinner?"</p><p class="standard">	"Sorry,
I can't. My mom will want me back. Maybe another time."</p><p class="standard">	"Okay.
Well, you'll be welcome."</p><p class="standard">	"I'll
see you at school tomorrow, Yuji," said Ai.</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
and Allen excused themselves as well, and the three set off down the
street towards Mariko's.</p><p class="standard">	"That's
something else, huh?" Mariko commented. "Ai's mother is
your father's secretary. When he starts banging her, that'll make you
two like, brother and sister!"</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
say that," Yuji groaned. "My father loves younger women."</p><p class="standard">	"Younger?
How old is he?" asked Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"Older."</p><p class="standard">	"Is
your mom 'older' too?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
told you, he loves younger women."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh."</p><p class="standard">	"Your
dad sounds like my kinda guy," said Allen. "Not ambitious
enough, though. I wanna see Kilimanjaro and Kilimanjaro's hot mom in
a tickle fight!" He was actually salivating. Yuji heard him suck
in so the drool wouldn't leak. "I bet Kilimanjaro wears the same
color panties as her pajamas....ooh yeah...."</p><p class="standard">	"He's
forgotten you're here," Yuji told Mariko. "He thinks it's
just him and the guys."</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
I have that effect on people!"</p><p class="standard">	"Why
are you boasting about that?"</p><p class="standard">	They
came to Mariko's house. "All right, see you guys tomorrow."</p><p class="standard">	Once
she'd gone inside, Yuji and Allen began the long trip home. They
walked in silence for a time, which was unusual when Allen was around
and didn't have food to shove in his face. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Which
one are you after?" Allen asked suddenly.</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?"</p><p class="standard">	"Which
one are you after? Kilimanjaro or McKinley?"</p><p class="standard">	"Neither.
I don't like girls."</p><p class="standard">	"C'mon,
man. It's me. You don't have to pretend to be all unsexual just to be
secretive."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
not pretending. I don't like girls."</p><p class="standard">	"But
c'mon, I know you're not gay. You're just putting on a character to
be cool. And that's fine, I understand, but I want you to be honest
with me, your best friend. So: which one is it?" 
</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
not putting on a character."</p><p class="standard">	"You
seem to get along well with McKinley, which is good, because I favor
Kilimanjaro. But Kilimanjaro<i> </i>seems to like <i>you</i>. What if
they both end up wanting to ride you? You'll kick some back to your
good friend Uncle Allen, right?"</p><p class="standard">	"Since
when are you my uncle?"</p><p class="standard">	"Still,
I'm kind of ticked." Allen scratched his head. "I thought
high-quality ladies went for charm and charisma. Instead Kilimanjaro
and McKinley are both dropping rocks for a sarcastic sourpuss. I
mean, an occasionally well-dressed, sorta cute sarcastic sourpuss,
but not—"</p><p class="standard">	"Allen,"
Yuji interrupted, "stop. If the girls at school hear you talking
like that, it's no wonder they think we're a couple."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
so only <i>you </i>can joke about us being a couple?"</p><p class="standard">	"The
point of my joke was that we're <i>not </i>a couple. If you keep on
like this, you can walk home by yourself."</p><p class="standard">	"No
worries, you put Butch down good. He won't be able to walk for
weeks."</p><p class="standard">	"No,
I didn't. I pulled my punches."</p><p class="standard">	"Wha—?!
You could've put him in the hospital!"</p><p class="standard">	"Let's
not get into this again, Allen."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	"So,
Yuji, what've you been up to recently?" his mother asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Where's
Shoko?"</p><p class="standard">	They
were having Chinese food. Yuji's mother served herself more of the
stir-fried chicken and bamboo shoots. Yuji himself liked the spicy
Mongolian beef. "She's been going out with her friends until
eight or nine every day. I'm a little worried about her."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
sure she's fine. How much trouble can a cancer patient get into
before nine?"</p><p class="standard">	"It
isn't just that. It's the way she dresses, and the way she talks to
me. It's like she's going through a rebellious stage."</p><p class="standard">	"She's
thirteen. It's normal." <i>And why am </i>I <i>telling her this?
</i>he thought.</p><p class="standard">	"You
never did this."</p><p class="standard">	"I
had other things on my mind."</p><p class="standard">	They
ate in silence for a while. The fried calamari had probably been
delicious when it was first cooked. It has become soggy locked in the
paper carton. The chow mein had fared better.</p><p class="standard">	"I
met some people," Yuji said at last. He helped himself to the
last steamed pork bun. "Two girls. Me and Allen have been
hanging out with them sometimes."</p><p class="standard">	"You
have new friends? That's great, Yuji! You know, you're too
introverted. You should go out and see what's waiting for you."</p><p class="standard">	"It's
not really like that...."</p><p class="standard">	"Tell
me about these girls."</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
there's Mariko. She's one of those Australian Cowgirls that came in
style about three years ago. And there's Ai, a traditional Japanese
beauty. Just like a kokeshi doll. The educational system in Japan is
three times more advanced than ours, so she skipped about four grades
coming here." 
</p><p class="standard">	They
heard the door open. A moment later Shoko entered the kitchen.</p><p class="standard">	"Hey
Mom. Hey Yuji. Any dinner left?" She was wearing a black
miniskirt, a pink cutoff top with a red heart in the center, and
little high-heeled sandals. Yuji didn't see what his mother was so
worried about. She wasn't any more of a slut than any other girl on
the street. Besides, for the last two years she'd been confined to a
hospital most of the time. Her hair had finally grown back in after
the last round of chemotherapy. She deserved to go have some fun,
even if the way she had it wasn't kid-friendly.</p><p class="standard">	"Shoko,
try to be back in time for dinner. Please?"</p><p class="standard">	"Sure.
By the way, I'll be out all day Saturday. Can I have some scratch?"</p><p class="standard">	"How
much would you like?"</p><p class="standard">	"Twenty
bucks should do me."</p><p class="standard">	She
handed it right over. Yuji frowned as he watched.</p><p class="standard">	</p><p class="standard">	"How's
your finger?" Yuji asked.</p><p class="standard">	"It
still hurts a little," said Ai. "But it's much better.
Thank you." The smile she flashed him was Bodhisattva-like. Then
she started to look worried. "Are you sure it's all right to be
skipping class like this?" 
</p><p class="standard">	"Sure
it's all right." Yuji tossed a stone into the canal. "No,
it's not. But it's the end of the year. We're just plowing through
pointless busy work."</p><p class="standard">	"I
suppose you're right."</p><p class="standard">	"You
came so late in the year you might have some trouble next year, but
it's too late now."</p><p class="standard">	"It'll
be all right. The middle school curriculum in Japan was a little
ahead of here." She said it without ego.</p><p class="standard">	"Really?
That's good. The curriculum in America was a little behind here, so
when I moved I had to do some catching up." Yuji tossed another
stone into the canal. "Listen, I brought you back here because I
need to know some things. Since I took Butch out, I deserve to know."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
looked surprised. "What do you want to know?"</p><p class="standard">	"It's
nothing big. I just wonder how you ended up going out with him. Even
for five days. And why."</p><p class="standard">	She
stared down at her knees. "I'm not strong."</p><p class="standard">	"How
strong've you gotta be to tell him you don't want to go out with
him?"</p><p class="standard">	"It.....it's
not easy. Not for me. He scared me, and he threatened me, and....I'm
weak. I guess I just used you to solve my problems for me. I'm
sorry."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
right," said Yuji. "You did use me. But I'd rather you'd
asked for my help sooner, before it came to fighting."</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji....."</p><p class="standard">	"Never
trap me like that again. I won't fight."</p><p class="standard">	"Um....is
it because you're a nyvamna."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
looked up. "How did you know?"</p><p class="standard">	"I've
seen them enough. The way you fought....your attacks were too precise
and powerful to be just martial arts."</p><p class="standard">	He
tossed in a clod of dirt. "You're right. No one else knows
except my parents and my sister. It's hard to tell, except for the
way I can move. The INAO call it air-dancing."</p><p class="standard">	"When
you hit Butch, Jack, and Richie you seemed to be floating."</p><p class="standard">	"That
would be it. They say it makes a low-gravity field around me or
something."</p><p class="standard">	"Are
you registered?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah.
They have me down as a Class C, so no one at school needs to know."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
looked up at the sky. It was a slightly overcast morning. The weather
in Sakura Memorial went in and out during the late spring and early
summer, shifting between sun and rain.</p><p class="standard">	"I
won't tell anyone," said Ai.</p><p class="standard">	"I'd
appreciate it. Even Allen doesn't know, and he'd never figure it
out."</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
he doesn't seem very sharp."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
snorted. "He's sharp as a laser about certain things. Peeping
being one of them. Luckily he's not in our PE class, or you'd have to
watch out changing."</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji....are
you afraid of your powers?"</p><p class="standard">	He
let himself fall back into dead crabgrass. Dry stalks were poking
into his back, scratching through his shirt. "I'm afraid of what
they can do if I let them get ahead of me. I may not make Class S in
the INAO's eyes, but five STUs is more than enough to kill a normal
person." He stood up. "I guess we'd better get to our next
classes." 	"Yuji, um...."</p><p class="standard">	"What
is it?"</p><p class="standard">	Ai
blushed. "Thank you. I owe you."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shrugged. "You can buy me dinner."</p><p class="standard">	He
hadn't gotten halfway around the building when Allen appeared. "Did
you ask her?"</p><p class="standard">	"Ask
her what?"</p><p class="standard">	Allen
sighed as if Yuji was meant to know what he was talking about. "If
she's into me!"</p><p class="standard">	"How
did you even know I was out here?"</p><p class="standard">	"You
weren't at your locker."</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
I'm not going to ask her if she's into you. How do you even know who
I was with?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
knew it was either McKinley or Kilimanjaro. Which is it? I don't
really care, I just want to know if she's into me."</p><p class="standard">	Annoyed,
Yuji turned and went back to the field. Allen hung back out of sight
but within earshot. Ai was still by the canal tossing in pebbles. He
sat down next to her again.</p><p class="standard">	"Can
I ask you something? Just to clear this up once and for all."</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?
Sure....What is it, Yuji?"</p><p class="standard">	"You
would never be interested in dating Allen, would you?"</p><p class="standard">	"Um....I....n-no...."
She had begun to blush. "I c-can't say I...."</p><p class="standard">	"No
boyfriend? No lovers? No courtly affair, frolicking in the park, or
romantic infatuation? No midnight meeting, no arranged marriage? I
just want to be clear."</p><p class="standard">	"No,
I....well, he....he's not really...."</p><p class="standard">	"Not
your type?" Yuji supplied.</p><p class="standard">	"Yes...."</p><p class="standard">	"Okay,
thanks for clearing that up. See you later."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
waved as he left, looking thoroughly confused.</p><p class="standard">	Allen
was still waiting around the side of the building. "Is that good
enough for you?" Yuji asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Man,
what're you doing? You couldn't be subtle?"</p><p class="standard">	"You're
one to talk about subtlety. That's why she's not into you—you're
always following her around yelling 'Kilimanjaro, Kilimanjaro!' You
come on like a besotted troubadour."</p><p class="standard">	"What
do you know? You don't even like girls!"</p><p class="standard">	"Allen,
girls aren't chess problems. They're just people. You don't have to
decode them and attack them with all your might."</p><p class="standard">	"What
do you know?"</p><p class="standard">	"It's
common sense. I'll see you at recess." That Allen didn't see the
sense in it was just another <i>symbollica brutallae </i>of the age.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard"><i>Love

      <div class="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard">	Yuji and
Mariko were in her room. She was lying on the bed. Yuji was lying on
the floor at the foot of the bed, too hot for dignity. They were
waiting for Ai, and as usual she was late.</p><p class="standard">	"I
love Ai, but she's the tardiest kid I've ever known," Mariko
commented.</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah.
Wonder why." 	</p><p class="standard">	"She
must be the kind of girl who needs every base covered before she goes
out. I used to be the same way."</p><p class="standard">	"Hm."</p><p class="standard">	"Purse
packed with an entire makeup cabinet, moist toilettes, tampons, birth
control. Everything short of a hair curler."</p><p class="standard">	"Ai
doesn't curl her hair."</p><p class="standard">	"How
do you know?"</p><p class="standard">	"Because
she's Japanese. They don't go for curly hair. Hair curlers are a
trademark of American women from the 1950's."</p><p class="standard">	"Hm,
guess you're right. I really should stop."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
opened half an eyeball. "You don't have curly hair."</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
I give my ponytails a little ripple."</p><p class="standard">	"It
looks fine. Whatever works."</p><p class="standard">	"Maybe
I should bleach it."</p><p class="standard">	"No,
it looks fine."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
tugged at her hair anxiously. "My—my
first boyfriend....he liked me blonde. The first time we ever did
anything was in this room. Over there, under the Elven Peach poster."
She smiled wistfully. "My parents were gone and I was newly
blonde, and I lost my virginity."</p><p class="standard">	"Good
to know." <i>Damn, what the hell am I supposed to say to that?!
</i>he thought.</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji....do
you want to kiss me?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji sat
up. Before he could think he'd said it. "Let's be friends."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	The words
hung in the suddenly thick air. Yuji felt he should do something to
shove them along. "I mean, I don't want to ruin what we have.
Our friendship. And anyway, I'm not good at kissing and stuff."</p><p class="standard">	"Neither'm
I," Mariko replied languidly. "One boyfriend. My time under
the Elven Peach poster was my only time. But how'll we learn without
practicing? C'mon, Yuji-boy. For practice."</p><p class="standard">	"No,
I can't," said Yuji firmly. "I just don't feel it."</p><p class="standard">	"You
never do. Do you even like girls? Kidding. I'm just messin' with you.
I mean, it's not like I want to have sex with you or anything."</p><p class="standard">	"How
did we go from not kissing to not having sex?"</p><p class="standard">	"Does
it matter? We're not doing it. In your dreams, Yuji-boy."</p><p class="standard">	There was
a knock on the door. "Come in!" Mariko called. Ai peeked in
hesitantly. "Um, your parents were out and the door was open,
so...."</p><p class="standard">	"I
know. Hold on, we'll go in a second. I just wanna get some water
first."</p><p class="standard">	She got
up from the bed. She was wearing pink shorts and a white tank top. Ai
was in a white summer dress and a big, flat hat. Neither was
flaunting anything; they were casual in their breezy summer beauty.
It was a rare thing to see a pair of girls so comfortable, especially
when going somewhere relatively nerdy like the arcade.</p><p class="standard">	"The
mall is going to be packed," Yuji predicted.</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
worry, I know a place. It's called Re di Gioco. In Tinsel Town."</p><p class="standard">	They went
down to the kitchen. The house was empty; Mariko's parents were at
the movies and her younger brother was at a friend's. Mariko filled a
glass from the sink and chugged it down without taking a breath. 
</p><p class="standard">	"You're
drinking tap water?" Yuji asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah."</p><p class="standard">	"What
about all those bottles of distilled mineral water in the
refrigerator?"</p><p class="standard">	"My
mom's. She drives me crazy with that health crap, and it drives her
crazy seeing me drink tap water. A perfect balance. All right, let's
go."</p><p class="standard">	The
winter had been bad, and now that it was finally getting warm,
everyone was taking advantage of it. The pudding bowls and the stick
figures reclined in bikinis on their front lawns alongside the
Average Joes and Jans. Sprinklers were running, wetting down the
sidewalk. Yuji's socks absorbed at least twelve fluid ounces of
moisture, and he assumed Mariko's must have as well. Ai was more
fortunate—she was wearing sandals—but the hem of her
dress took a few wettings.</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
surprised no one's bitched to the neighborhood organization,"
Yuji commented.</p><p class="standard">	"They
would have, if the members weren't all in Tahiti right now,"
said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	They
boarded the train. Yuji paid the fare for all of them. It was midday
on a weekend, so the train was relatively empty. Most people were
enjoying the sunny weather rather than hiding away in a dark arcade
in uptown. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Tell
me again why Allen couldn't come," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"He's
an idiot."</p><p class="standard">	"Sure,
but I don't like keeping secrets from him."</p><p class="standard">	"Bad
for the relationship, huh? Don't worry, your love will always
rekindle."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji made
a face. "If I swung that way, I'd definitely choose someone
better looking."</p><p class="standard">	"Um....so....do
you?" Ai asked. "I mean....swing that way? You told me you
don't like girls," she quickly added. "I just wondered."</p><p class="standard">	"No.
And I don't like keeping secrets from Allen because he won't shut up
until he drags them out. Then I have to listen to three hours of him
bawling 'Oh Kilimanjaro, oh McKinley!' and that's the last thing I
want to hear."</p><p class="standard">	"So
tell him to shut up."</p><p class="standard">	"Like
he'd listen."</p><p class="standard">	The train
rattled on the tracks. Two teenage girls in bright green halter tops
and neon pink miniskirts walked through, each chattering loudly to a
different person on her cell phone. Three guys in their twenties
stood in the back of the car discussing a graphic sexual encounter
that involved two girls, a bottle of chocolate syrup, and a Slip 'n'
Slide. Yuji could see Ai's eyes getting wider and wider with each
lurid detail, until they were so huge he expected her head to pop.</p><p class="standard">	"The
guy's lying," he told her.</p><p class="standard">	"Hm?"</p><p class="standard">	"Watch
his eyes." They waited for him to speak again. "See how he
looked to the right?" Ai nodded. "It means he's accessing
the creative half of his brain."</p><p class="standard">	"Wow,
I didn't know that! If he looks to his left, does that mean he's
telling the truth?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
nodded. "Just now when he said the girls didn't even give him
their numbers, he looked left. Probably just accosted some girls and
sandwiched the two halves of the story around some lie."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
pretty impressive, Yuji-boy," said Mariko. "I'll try that
out next time my dad says our TV works fine."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh
yeah, that 1950's pile of crap that only gets two channels."</p><p class="standard">	"Meanwhile
my parents have a plasma screen in their room," Mariko snorted.
"I'll try that next time my mom says TV is filthy trash that no
one should watch, too."</p><p class="standard">	</p><p class="standard">	Ai read
manga and watched anime, but she'd never touched a fighting game in
her life. Mariko and Yuji, both decent players, set about teaching
her Tsubasa Equive: Winged Warriors. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Choose
your character," Mariko instructed. "Which one do you
like?"</p><p class="standard">	"Um....I
don't know. Hmm....I can't decide."</p><p class="standard">	"I
think Mikan is perfect for you," said Mariko seriously, moving
the cursor to the tiny girl in the orange jumper who was Tsubasa
Equive's weakest, lightest character.</p><p class="standard">	"Kalechit
is easier for a beginner," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	They let
Ai play against the computer for a while, giving her tips when she
needed them. Most of their advice was wasted, since Ai was the worst
fighting game player Yuji had ever seen. She panicked halfway through
the match and started flailing on the buttons. "Oh no....that
can't be good....I'm awful, aren't I?"</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
worry, everyone starts out bad," said Mariko. 
</p><p class="standard">	<i>But
not this bad, </i>thought Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Maybe
fighting games just aren't your thing," Mariko went on. "Why
don't we try some racing games?"</p><p class="standard">	Racing
games weren't Yuji's strong point, so he sat back with a can of
coffee and let the girls play some game about driving European cars
along mountain roads on the coastline. Mariko was quite good, but Ai
crashed and burned as much as she'd been pummeled in the fighting
games. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
maybe racers aren't really your thing either. How about...."</p><p class="standard">	"RPGs,"
said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"What?"</p><p class="standard">	"RPGs,"
he repeated. "We're still on for dinner at your house tomorrow,
right? Let her try some RPGs." He thought of the bookshelf at
Ai's, packed with fantasies and language texts. "She'll love
them."</p><p class="standard">	"Do
you mean like Dragon Quest?" Ai asked. "Um....I didn't like
that game much...."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
grinned. "Nothing like Dragon Quest. Wait until you try Final
Fantasy, or Full Metal Basket."</p><p class="standard">	"Which
FF games have you got?" Mariko asked.</p><p class="standard">	"All
of them, but VII and IX were the best."</p><p class="standard">	"You
didn't like X?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
hated it!"</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
went to get drinks while Yuji had a go at History's Incredible
Warriors: HIW. This and DC vs. Konami were his best games. In DC vs.
Konami his best characters were John Constantine and Shiori Fujisaki;
in HIW it was Immortal Vampire John F. Kennedy, who'd been
resurrected by aliens to avenge his death. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Wow,
you're good!" Ai remarked as he pummeled someone who was playing
as The Miner 2049er. All the machines in the arcade were connected
through a local area network, so Yuji could fight anyone else who was
playing.</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
all right, but there're lots of people better than me."</p><p class="standard">	"You
must spend a lot of time here."</p><p class="standard">	"What's
that supposed to mean?"</p><p class="standard">	"Oh....I'm
sorry. Nothing."</p><p class="standard">	"C'mon,
I was kidding."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh!"
Ai laughed, too late.</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
strain yourself."</p><p class="standard">	Ai looked
down at her shoes. "I'm sorry. I'm a really horrible
conversationalist."</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
worry about it. Allen won't shut up about girls for five seconds, do
you know how annoying that is?"</p><p class="standard">	Ai
laughed, punctually this time. "I suppose. But I envy Mariko.
You and she seem to get along so well.</p><p class="standard">	"I
guess." <i>But not well enough to practice having sex on each
other, </i>he added mentally.</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
do you suppose I could ever be like her?"</p><p class="standard">	"You
shouldn't want to be."</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?"</p><p class="standard">	"You're
you. Instead of trying to be like someone else, you should try as
best you can to be you."</p><p class="standard">	For some
reason, that made her blush again. <i>Not only is she the tardiest
kid, she's also the blushingest. I guess it's kind of endearing,
though, </i>he thought.</p><p class="standard">	"Hey!
You guys aren't talking about me, are you?" Mariko asked. She
passed an oolong tea to Yuji, a coffee to Ai, and kept a cola for
herself. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
we are. I noticed a mint-green pinafore in your closet and I was
wondering why you'd want to look like Alice in Wonderland on
steroids," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"What
were you doing looking in my closet? Are you one of those weirdos who
steals women's underwear and sniffs it?"</p><p class="standard">	"No,
I was just hoping you kept naked pictures of yourself in the drawer.
I could sell them on eBay for thousands."</p><p class="standard">	"Just
don't try to hack into my shower cam."</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
worry, I'm an idiot with computers. I can type and surf the 'net
without breaking it, and that's about it."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
laughed. "Me too. Ai?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
know a little, but not much." She was red in the face again.
Yuji thought he knew why.</p><p class="standard">	"So
I was thinking, instead of coming to my house, why don't we go out to
eat?" said Mariko. "I know a good restaurant. It's in the
mall by Yuji's place."</p><p class="standard">	"The
Mall on the Lake? If it's in there, we'll need an expense account to
afford it."</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
worry, I'm tight with the management."</p><p class="standard">	"How
tight?"</p><p class="standard">	"Tight
enough to get discounted food but not tight enough to ask for an
emergency last-minute fake date to the dance."</p><p class="standard">	"It's
Saturday, though," said Yuji. "That place will be packed."</p><p class="standard">	"Then
we'd better get going now."</p><p class="standard">	They were
leaving the arcade when Ai announced she needed to use the restroom.
Mariko smirked. "Too much coffee then, Ai?"</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
sorry...."</p><p class="standard">	"No
need to be sorry, just hurry."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
and Yuji sat down on a bench outside and watched people dressed in
clothes from Guess and The Gap pass by. The girls were all wearing
pink miniskirts, and all the guys were wearing pre-faded jeans with
holes cut in the knees, but Yuji noticed one guy whose jeans were
intact and not faded.</p><p class="standard">	"Isn't
that Jolie Rokudo?" asked Mariko. "Is that her new
boyfriend?"</p><p class="standard">	"That's
Allen," said Yuji dully.</p><p class="standard">	"Allen?
Jolie the Prissy Snob Rokudo is going out with 'Oh Kilimanjaro! Oh
McKinley!' Alice Amadea Jollyheim? My god, it <i>is </i>him! Allen!
Jolie!" 
</p><p class="standard">	"That
characterization was—wait,
don't call them over!" Yuji protested.</p><p class="standard">	It was
too late; Allen and Jolie had heard, seen them, and were heading
over. Allen though Yuji would be catching up on homework today—now
he'd have to come up with a convincing reason why he was at the
arcade with Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"Hi,
Mariko!" said Jolie. She said it with such enthusiasm that it
was obvious she hated Mariko's guts.</p><p class="standard">	"Hey
Jolie. Allen."</p><p class="standard">	"Hello,
McKinley—I mean Mariko," Allen replied. He couldn't have
sounded more smug. "Yuji! What're you doing here? I thought you
had homework."</p><p class="standard">	"I
finished early, and Mariko asked me to come," Yuji replied.</p><p class="standard">	"We
were just about to go out to dinner, d'you wanna come?" asked
Mariko sweetly. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
sorry Mariko. Allen and I have reservations at Le Jaune. They have
the most sanitary kitchens in the city, you know. Well, it was great
to see you, and you too, You Gee, but now I must bid you <i>adieu</i>."
She left with Allen trailing behind her.</p><p class="standard">	"I
hate her," said Mariko. For some reason she had a huge grin on
her face. Ai returned just in time to catch the remark.</p><p class="standard">	"Did
I miss something?" she asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Not
much," said Yuji. "Let's go."</p><p class="standard">	It was
only ten blocks from Re di Gioco to the park, so they didn't bother
to wait for a train. "What was Alice's problem?" Mariko
demanded. They passed a teenage girl asking her friend the same
question about her mother.</p><p class="standard">	"Did
you see him with that girl?" asked Ai. "I'm not sure what
her name is...."</p><p class="standard">	"Jolie!
Jolie Rokudo! Does that mean you knew about them?"</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
I saw them yesterday, but I didn't know who she was, so....Is it
significant?"</p><p class="standard">	"It
damn well is! Jolie Rokudo is the snobbiest, bitchiest bitchy snob in
the school—maybe in the whole city—and she's going out
with little Alice Sternheim, laughingstock of same!"</p><p class="standard">	"Only
the ROTC and us three laugh at him," Yuji informed her. "The
Schlemiels and the Schlimazels think he's really cool. He told Jolie
some story about threatening Butch in a bar with a broken bottle and
she lapped it up."</p><p class="standard">	"She
may be a snob, but I suppose she's not very smart," said Ai
thoughtfully. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Zing!
Ai's spicy center shows," said Mariko. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
I don't like to speak badly of people I hardly know, but if Allen's
usual tactics are working on her...."</p><p class="standard">	"She's
a Blarney Stone," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?"
From both girls.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
wasn't looking forward to explaining this, but he grinned weakly.
"Allen ranks girls by how good-looking they are, how fun they
are, and how easily they fall for his smooth talk. He correlates his
data with the comparative heights of various mountains and assigns
every girl he knows a different mountain name."</p><p class="standard">	"So
I'm Mt. McKinley?" asked Mariko. "That might've been
flattering, even coming from him, before I saw how low he'll stoop."</p><p class="standard">	"No,
this is exactly what he needs. If he can keep this going long enough
to sleep with her—probably a week, which is a week longer than
Kelly Brugmann—then he'll see it's nothing and shut up."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
whistled. "You are one wicked dude, Yuji-boy. And I mean wicked
like the witch, not like the waves." Yuji wondered if she was
thinking about him refusing her earlier. <i>No way. That was a joke.
A bad one, but Mariko's not infallible. She makes bad jokes
sometimes.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>"But
what does it mean, to be the Blarney Stone?" Ai inquired.</p><p class="standard">	"It
means she's a rock soaked in drunken Irishmen's urine."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
burst out laughing.</p><p class="standard">	They
entered the park through a Shinto archway hung with talisman scrolls.
Yuji had a fair command of Japanese writing, but he'd never been able
to read a talisman. The calligraphy was too stylized. On a whim he
asked Ai if she could read it.</p><p class="standard">	"No,"
she confessed. "I'm not sure anyone can. I never met a person
who could other than a Shinto priest. My mom used to be a <i>miko</i>,
and she couldn't even read them."</p><p class="standard">	"You
aren't Shinto, are you?" Mariko asked.</p><p class="standard">	"No.
My brother Xenophon is a Christian, so he wouldn't have approved."</p><p class="standard">	"Are
you Christian, then?"</p><p class="standard">	"No....not
exactly." 
</p><p class="standard">	"Close
with your brother?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes...."
She blushed, but didn't elaborate. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Sorry.
Only you're kind of a mystery," said Mariko. "I don't know
much about you or your family."</p><p class="standard">	"I
can't think of anything interesting to tell you.....My other brothers
aren't Christian, nor is my father. We're pretty normal....</p><p class="standard">Father
reads the newspaper, my brothers play sports, and I read."</p><p class="standard">	"And
Allen's not your type," Yuji supplied. "Although you're
hardly alone in that. You know, that's why he's going out with Jolie.
To make you jealous."</p><p class="standard">	"M-me?"</p><p class="standard">	"He's
so predictable,"<i> </i>Mariko commented. "Watch enough
American sitcoms and you've got his entire playbook right in front of
you. I know I've seen this 'Make her jealous so she'll realize her
feelings for me' crap in an episode of <i>Cheers</i>."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
offered to pay the nine dollars to get all three of them across the
lake, but when she opened her purse she discovered she'd forgotten
her wallet. Yuji paid it instead.</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
sorry."</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
worry about it. Not your fault," said Yuji absently.</p><p class="standard">	"I
really feel bad about this."</p><p class="standard">	"You
just forgot your wallet. It's not your fault. Besides, my dad sends
me a hundred dollars every week. I'm not hard up for money."</p><p class="standard">	"Still...."</p><p class="standard">	"Do
you have to blame yourself for everything? Save it for when you blow
a nuclear reactor."</p><p class="standard">	"Ah,
you kids. You have-a such-a fun together. And that's <i>amore</i>!"
sighed the gondolier.</p><p class="standard">	"Shut
up man, you're a Czech," Mariko chided him.</p><p class="standard">	"Czechs
are a very romantic people," the gondolier responded
indignantly. When they got off, Yuji made sure to leave him an
extra-large tip.</p><p class="standard">	The
inside of the mall was huge as a cathedral. It was filled with
sunlight admitted by the glass ceiling. Each of the four entrances
led into a boulevard lined with shops and separated into two lanes by
a strip of grass and flowerbeds. The four boulevards drained into a
vast junction crisscrossed with escalators. At the center of the
junction was an octagonal pillar of smoked glass. The center pillar
had five shops for each of the mall's five floors, but the only way
to reach them was the glass elevator at its base. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji had
explored the pillar before, so he knew there were two restaurants
there: a blindingly overpriced family dining restaurant on the third
floor, and a pretentious French bistro on the fifth. He thought the
French place might be worth the experience at a discount, since it
had a rooftop plaza, but the family dining restaurant was just
Sizzler's for triple the price. 
</p><p class="standard">	It looked
like he was in luck: Mariko had pressed the button for the fifth
floor. "You guys ever had bistro food before?"</p><p class="standard">	"No.
I did try a French restaurant in New York once...." Ai's face
didn't attest to it being a pleasurable experience.</p><p class="standard">	"This
isn't that snails and raw egg crap they serve in America. This is
what real people in France actually eat."</p><p class="standard">	"Careful
there, Mariko. Saying 'real' and 'actual' that much makes you sound
like a hippie," Yuji said.</p><p class="standard">	The
restaurant was dark inside. There was no maitre d' as Yuji had
expected, but the place was fuller than he'd thought. Neither he nor
the girls were dressed appropriately; the other girls were all
wearing neon-colored floral halter tops and black low-rise jeans. The
other boys were also in black low-rise jeans, but they were wearing
sleeveless slash-necked tops. 
</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
guided them to an empty table. "She should be on duty right now.
Just let me find her." She banged on the table, startling Ai and
attracting the stares of several nearby diners. "Lazy bitch.
She's slacking in the break room and making moon eyes at her boss."
She got up and stalked off somewhere.</p><p class="standard">	"What
do you think the chances are Mariko's planning a dine-and-dash?"
said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"No,
she's not lying about knowing the management. I can tell," Ai
replied. "She looked left when she told us."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
chuckled. "You were paying attention."</p><p class="standard">	"It's
nothing. Um, can I ask you a question?"</p><p class="standard">	"Go
ahead."</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
what's your t-type....I mean....when it comes to girls." She had
turned red. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
told you, I don't like girls."</p><p class="standard">	"N-no....I
mean....Just as friends, you know."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji was
saved from answering by Mariko's reappearance, accompanied by the
scowling, bespectacled girl he'd seen her with on the day he had
refused to fight Butch Christensen. She looked marginally happier
now, although she scowled briefly when she saw Yuji. He couldn't
imagine what he might have done to her.</p><p class="standard">	"This
is my best friend, Yumiko Kanzaki," said Mariko. "Yumiko,
this is Yuji Watanabe and Ai Maeda."</p><p class="standard">	"Howdy-do,"
Yumiko mumbled. "Orders?"</p><p class="standard">	"French
onion soup for me," said Mariko. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
could I see a menu?" asked Ai.</p><p class="standard">	"Ain't
one. French onion soup or bouillabaisse."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh.....bouillabaisse,
I suppose."</p><p class="standard">	"I'll
have the same," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"And
a bottle of Dom Perignon," Mariko added.</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
jotted down their orders and stalked off without another word.
"Sorry," said Mariko. "The chef had to go, his wife's
having their second kid, so the specials aren't prepared and they
won't give me a discount on anything but the soup."</p><p class="standard">	"What
about champagne?" asked Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
I get two bottles of free champagne a year. One whenever I want, and
one on my birthday."</p><p class="standard">	"Do
you really want to use that now, then?" asked Ai.</p><p class="standard">	"No
worries. It's my birthday."</p><p class="standard">	"You
kept that one under your hat," Yuji commented.</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
laughed. "You should see your face, Ai! Don't worry. I wanted to
celebrate with you guys and Yumiko, but she couldn't get off work, so
I brought you here. Her boss'll let her."</p><p class="standard">	"She
doesn't seem too happy about it," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"She's
just being shy. She likes to give people the cold shoulder at first,
especially guys, but she'll come around."</p><p class="standard">	"Why
doesn't she like guys?"</p><p class="standard">	"The
same reason you don't like girls—she won't say, but she never
stops reminding me."</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't dislike girls," said Yuji. "I just don't want to date
them."</p><p class="standard">	"Both
of you have suffered," said Ai. Yuji and Mariko both looked at
her and she blushed. "Sorry....Ignore me, I'm only babbling.
Please! I didn't mean anything," she protested when neither
looked away.</p><p class="standard">	"You're
right, Yumiko hasn't had a hunky-dory suburban life," said
Mariko. "Don't mention it to her. She'll just get mad at me."</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
returned a moment later. "Water." She plunked three glasses
down on the table. "Bread." She dropped the basket of bread
from enough height that two pieces bounced out. "Goodbye."</p><p class="standard">	Whatever
Mariko said, Yuji didn't think Yumiko was just being shy, and he said
so. Mariko shrugged. "She's a little annoyed with me. That's
all."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji and
Mariko told Ai about RPGs until Yumiko returned with their orders.
She plunked them down in the middle of the table. "Food."
She dropped the ice bucket with a crash. "Champagne. It's break
time, so if you need anything else, Connie will handle it."</p><p class="standard">	"Wait,
Yumiko—come on. So I interrupted your break. It's my birthday,
forgive me. Sit with us."</p><p class="standard">	"No
thank you," Yumiko answered. She turned brusquely to go.</p><p class="standard">	"Fine.
I guess the three of us will have to eat the chocolate ice cream cake
I bought for myself without you." 
</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
about-faced. "Well, maybe Mr. Molokom will let me hang out."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
the spirit."</p><p class="standard">	"Let
me get my lunch."</p><p class="standard">	She
returned with a bowl of French onion soup and a glass of water. Yuji
watched her take off her glasses and set them aside before tucking
in. "What're you staring at?" 
</p><p class="standard">	"Nothing."</p><p class="standard">	"Good.
'Cause there's nothing to be staring at."</p><p class="standard">	"So,
you won't believe who Jolie Rokudo is going out with now," said
Mariko. "Allen Sternheim!"</p><p class="standard">	"I
saw them yesterday," said Yumiko. "Didn't know who the hell
he was. I think I've got it now. Member of the chess club?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes."</p><p class="standard">	"He
hangs out with <i>you </i>all the time, huh?" She regarded Yuji
coldly. "They say you're lovers."</p><p class="standard">	"We're
not."</p><p class="standard">	"Good.
'Cause men are only good for one thing, but homos are no good at
all." She dipped a chunk of baguette in her soup and bolted it
down in half a second. They sat in awkward silence for another moment
before Yumiko turned her chilly gaze on Ai.</p><p class="standard">	"You're
new, huh?"</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
yes. M-my n-name is Ai Maeda, a-and—"</p><p class="standard">	"I
know your name. What I wanna know is, are you good for anything, or
just another useless pink salon girl?"</p><p class="standard">	Ai turned
deep scarlet. "I....I mean...."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
saved her with a brash laugh. "We can't all have jobs, Yumiko!"

</p><p class="standard">	It
sounded too forced, too much like a schoolteacher, but Yumiko scowled
and subsided.</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
going to the bathroom," said Yuji. He didn't really need to, but
he couldn't take any more without a break. He hoped Mariko would open
the champagne soon; that might make it easier.</p><p class="standard">	The
bathrooms were tiled in neon purple and lit only with blacklights,
which Yuji found quite strange. He used the urinal and turned around
to wash his hands to be confronted with Yumiko.</p><p class="standard">	"God!"
he cried out. "What're you doing in here, trying to garrote me
or something?"</p><p class="standard">	"Hardy
har. Listen, Meat."</p><p class="standard">	"My
name's Yuji...."</p><p class="standard">	"You're
all meat to me. Just animals. Now listen. You're Mariko's right now,
and if you hurt her, you'll answer to me."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
wasn't sure whether to be scared or laugh. "Right. Okay. Well,
thanks for the tip."</p><p class="standard">	"I
know you boys. You're all the same. But I can do things to your
manhood that won't stop hurting until the day you die. So I'd shut up
if I were you."</p><p class="standard">	"I
never wanted to talk in the first place."</p><p class="standard">	"Laugh
all you want, but just wait."</p><p class="standard">	"By
the way, I understand you hate boys, but why are you being such a
bitch to Ai?"</p><p class="standard">	"You
call me a bitch?" 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
call it as I see it."</p><p class="standard">	He went
to wash his hands. Yumiko stared at him, her skin giving off a creepy
yellow glow in the black light. "Mariko claims you don't like
girls."</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't."</p><p class="standard">	"But
you don't like guys."</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't."</p><p class="standard">	"You're
a damn liar! Everybody likes somebody!"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
turned on the air dryer. The jet of hot air blew over his hands,
evaporating the moisture. "You don't."</p><p class="standard">	"Shut
up!" she snapped. "You don't know anything!"</p><p class="standard">	"I
know as much as you know about me."</p><p class="standard">	She
stopped, unable to think of a reply, so Yuji pressed his advantage.
"I like Mariko, but we're not together. We're just friends."
He passed Yumiko and returned to the table. She followed him the
whole way in angry silence.</p><p class="standard">	"Yumi,
I appreciate the thought, but I don't need you to threaten Yuji for
me," said Mariko the instant they returned. 
</p><p class="standard">	"He's
a man. He just wants to screw you and leave you," Yumiko
snapped. "The only way to win is to screw him and leave him
first."</p><p class="standard">	"Stop
it! Leave him alone!" It wasn't Mariko who said this, but Ai.
When everyone stared at her in disbelief she turned red and tried to
sink into her chair.</p><p class="standard">	"What
did you say to me?" Yumiko demanded. She sounded as incredulous
as Yuji felt.</p><p class="standard">	"I
just didn't want you to insult Yuji anymore. He did something very
kind for me without expecting any reward at all."</p><p class="standard">	"What,
watch you try on bras and tell you what looks good? Sleep with you
and make you feel 'special?'"</p><p class="standard">	"He
saved me from Butch Christensen."</p><p class="standard">	"Butch
Christensen? What'd you do, sleep with him so she didn't have to?"</p><p class="standard">	Ai was
about to say, but Yuji gave her a 'cut' sign and she stopped.</p><p class="standard">	"If
it's just going to be a problem, I'll go," he said.</p><p class="standard">	"How
manly of you," Yumiko sneered.</p><p class="standard">	"How
much do I owe for the check?"</p><p class="standard">	"Forty
dollars."</p><p class="standard">	"Ten
for the soup," Mariko corrected. "The champagne's on the
house."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
tossed a bill on the table. "All right. See you later. Sorry,
Mariko."</p><p class="standard">	She
shrugged. "Don't worry about it."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	There
was a knock at the door. "Come in!" Yuji called from the
living room.</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
entered. She looked around. "Nice pad you've got here. Anyone
around?"</p><p class="standard">	"My
sister's out somewhere, and my mother's at an art fair. So no."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
came into the living room and sat down on the couch. Yuji watched the
four o' clock news from an armchair. First came the news that another
"celebutante" had been jailed. Next was a story about a hot
blonde teacher who'd been caught shagging her seventeen-year-old
student. The student was also a member of the cheerleading squad
which the teacher coached. 
</p><p class="standard">	"And
in other news, a Sakura County woman today became the first one
hundred and fifteen-year-old to sink a hole-in-one! Rajvat Shivi has
more."</p><p class="standard">	"Doris
Cugdman, a lifelong resident of Dubovy Drive, reached her hundred and
fifteenth birthday earlier this year. But that wasn't enough for her.
The one hundred and fifteen-year-old is an avid golf player, and made
it her goal to be the first centenarian to sink a hole-in-one."</p><p class="standard">	"Listen,
I'm sorry about Yumiko," Mariko said. "I didn't think she'd
be that bad."</p><p class="standard">	"It's
fine. Not your fault."</p><p class="standard">	"It
<i>is</i>. I knew she'd be like that, but I didn't think it'd be that
bad. I thought she'd gotten better, but if she's following you to the
bathroom to threaten you she obviously hasn't."</p><p class="standard">	"Where's
Ai?"</p><p class="standard">	"She
said she was tired and went home."</p><p class="standard">	"Dealing
with a psycho is tiring work," Yuji agreed.</p><p class="standard">	"I
talked to her about it."</p><p class="standard">	"Mariko,
I said it's not your fault. I just can't hang out with Yumiko
anymore. What's her deal, anyway? You probably know."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
was silent. "That's great, Tom," chuckled the female
newscaster on the TV. "Maybe young blonde schoolteachers <i>should
</i>take up golf."</p><p class="standard">	"You
have to tell me something first," said Mariko. "About
yourself. Why you don't like girls. Then I'll tell you something
equally horrible about Yumiko."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
considered for a moment. "I want some tea," he said. "Let's
have some tea. Then we'll talk."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
followed him into the kitchen and watched him make genmaicha. It was
Yuji's favorite: green tea with popped rice, which gave it a nutty
flavor. Sometimes when there wasn't any he would pour sesame oil into
regular green tea.</p><p class="standard">	"You
make that well," she commented. "Too well. If you're not
gay, you used to be a girl, huh?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes.
That's my secret. Now tell me Yumiko's."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
didn't answer. She watched Yuji bring the tea into the living room	
and set it on the coffee table. The news was closing out with a story
about a breakthrough drug that would cure sleeping limbs. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
used to like girls," he said finally. "A lot. But I did
something terrible to a girl I really liked."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
it?" Mariko asked. "That's all you're saying?" Yuji
nodded. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Fine.
Yumiko used to like boys, but a boy she really liked did something
terrible to her. Now she only likes a certain part of them."</p><p class="standard">	"That
explains a lot," said Yuji. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
need more practice with that certain part. Help out a friend, huh?
For her birthday."</p><p class="standard">	"What?"
The switch in topic was so abrupt that Yuji didn't realize at first
what she was talking about.</p><p class="standard">	"Just
kidding. C'mon, can't you take a joke?"</p><p class="standard">	"Ookay.
You're being really weird today, Mariko."</p><p class="standard">	"Hey,
listen Yuji, I don't care what Yumiko thinks. Let's stay friends."</p><p class="standard">	"If
you're going to keep being weird, I don't know if I want to."
Mariko didn't seem to be listening to him.</p><p class="standard">	"But
hey, I've got to tell you something before this goes any further."</p><p class="standard">	"You
used to be a man?"</p><p class="standard">	"The
truth is, I'm a nyvamna."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
finished his tea and poured himself another cup. "Registered?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes."</p><p class="standard">	"What
class?"</p><p class="standard">	"Class
C."</p><p class="standard">	"Anyone
else know?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
told Yumiko ages ago....my family knows, of course....and Ai."</p><p class="standard">	"Did
Ai figure it out on her own?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes!
How'd you know?"</p><p class="standard">	"Because
she did me too." 
</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
broke into a broad grin. "C'mon, quit kidding, I'm serious
here."</p><p class="standard">	"Me
too. She must be good if she figured it out without seeing you
fight."</p><p class="standard">	"Then
you really are....Damn! That's cool! I never thought I'd meet another
one!"</p><p class="standard">	"It's
not that big a deal."</p><p class="standard">	"It
is! What's your type and skill and all that?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
avoided the question for a moment by picking up the remote and
beginning to flip through channels. Predictably, there was nothing
on—certainly nothing interesting enough to distract Mariko when
she was so excited to keep talking about this. "Tell me yours
first."</p><p class="standard">	"All
right. Chikara-type, with contact discharge as a skill. So they say.
Basically it means I can blow out a bunch of energy from my hands and
destroy things."</p><p class="standard">	"Chikara-type,"
Yuji replied. He took a sip from his empty cup—where had his
tea gone?—and poured himself another. "Air-dancing."
He took down half his tea in one gulp. It was becoming tepid and
over-steeped. "We sound like characters in a Tom Clancy book,"
he said, trying to lighten the mood.</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
a little," said Mariko with a shrug. "Then that's how you
beat up the ROTC, huh?"</p><p class="standard">	"Give
me some credit," said Yuji, annoyed. "I trained in martial
arts for eight years. I could fight without being a nyvamna. It just
gets a little hard not to use it."</p><p class="standard">	"I
guess it would be harder to hold back air-dancing, since you don't
really have conscious control over it," Mariko agreed. "I
have to try really hard to use my skill, though, so it's easy to hold
back."</p><p class="standard">	"I
hold it back by not fighting."</p><p class="standard">	"But
you fought Butch and his thugs."</p><p class="standard">	"They
were beating up Allen, and he hurt Ai."</p><p class="standard">	"So
you'll only fight if someone is in danger. Just like an avenging
knight."</p><p class="standard">	"No,
nothing like a knight."</p><p class="standard">	"I
dub thee Sir Surly-lot the Brave!"</p><p class="standard">	"Get
out of it!"</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
you're right. They never would've knighted someone as dour as you.
They'd want a knight who'd send his best lady a hundred roses and
meet for forbidden trysts in a forest clearing."</p><p class="standard">	"Genghis
Khan would've been glad to take you and Yumiko, though. He liked
women who'd pick a paleface's bones clean."</p><p class="standard">	The
phone in the kitchen rang, and Yuji went to get it. According to the
caller ID, it was from his father's cell phone. He answered.</p><p class="standard">	"Hello?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji?"</p><p class="standard">	"Hey
Dad. What's up?"</p><p class="standard">	"Can
I ask you for a favor?"</p><p class="standard">	"What
is it?"</p><p class="standard">	"I'd
like it if you didn't go to school on Monday. Act like you're going
and spend the day in the mall or somewhere, lying low.  Could you do
that?"</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?
Why?"</p><p class="standard">	"I'd
like it if you would. Okay? Come by my office if you like. I won't
have much free time, but I think I can hook you up with a job you
might like."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shrugged. "Okay, I guess."</p><p class="standard">	"All
right. Thank you, Yuji. I'll see you then." He hung up.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
returned to the living room. "Who was it?" Mariko asked.</p><p class="standard">	"My
dad. He just wanted to see me on Monday."</p><p class="standard">	"Your
parents are divorced?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah."</p><p class="standard">	"I
wish my dad would ditch my mom, sometimes. Then we could eat real
food and not have to hide it in the garage. My dad learned
refrigerator repair just so he could install a cooling device in his
toolbox. Mom thinks he's obsessed with home improvement."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
a bit strange."</p><p class="standard">	"You'd
do it too if you'd lived with her as long as he has. Her idea of
Christmas dinner involves no fat, oil, grease, sugar, or spice of any
kind. The turkey wasn't slaughtered, it was starved to death, and
it's got no seasoning or basting, so it's as dry as can be. Imagine
that nightmare every year of your life, then imagine it every day of
your life."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shrugged. 
</p><p class="standard">	"That's
typical of you. Well, guess I'd better get going. Yumiko and I have
an ice cream cake to finish by ourselves." She got up.</p><p class="standard">	"It's
not your fault," said Yuji. "It's hers. If she'd pull the
stick out of her ass, I would've been glad to stay."</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
I know. But you wouldn't blame her if you knew what she's been
through. Probably worse than your reason for not liking girls.
Anyway, see you."</p><p class="standard">	</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
did as his father had asked and stayed out of school on Monday. He
hung out at the arcade for a few hours, then went to the library, and
at twelve he boarded a train to Ode. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
had been to his father's office twice: two years ago when his mother
had miscarried a third child, and a year ago when Shoko had collapsed
and been hospitalized. Both times he had gone to deliver the news
himself instead of just calling. They always said you wanted to be by
their side when stuff like that happened, but Yuji's instinct had
been just the opposite: he wanted to get away and let the doctors do
their work. He felt somehow they had a better chance of success
without him looking over their shoulders.</p><p class="standard">	Ode
was a bigger city than Sakura Memorial, but most of the culture was
in the smaller city. Ode was a shipping and business center. It sat
atop Hataraku Bay, where ships docked day and night to drop off huge
cargo containers full of goods. There were a few suburbs and low-rent
apartments where people lived, but for the most part, both rich and
poor chose their homes in Sakura Memorial. 
</p><p class="standard">	The
train ran over the elevated rails, giving Yuji a view of the bay.
With the sun glinting on the clear water, he could almost see
dolphins leaping from the waves—except that any marine life in
the area would have been shredded like canned tuna by the propellers
of the merchant ships.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
got off at the Kyuujin Street station and walked four blocks to his
father's Grantsoft office building. He went into the granite-pillared
lobby and checked in with the receptionist.</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
I'm so sorry," she said the moment she saw him.</p><p class="standard">	"For
what?"</p><p class="standard">	"Has
something happened to your family again?"</p><p class="standard">	"No.
I'm just here to see my dad."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh."
The receptionist looked embarrassed. "Okay. Go right on up."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
stepped into the elevator and ascended to his father's office on the
98th floor. His father was sitting at his desk working on something.
He looked up when he noticed Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Hey,
Dad."</p><p class="standard">	"Hi,
Yuji. Thanks for coming. Why don't you sit down? I'll be done in a
minute."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
sat down in the chair across from his father and wondered why offices
always had hard uncomfortable seats on this side of the desk. <i>Maybe
so interviewees feel like they're being interrogated.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>"Why
did you want me to stay home from school?" Yuji asked suddenly.</p><p class="standard">	His
father wasn't done with the papers yet, but he looked up anyway.
"Well, the year's almost over and you were complaining that
there's nothing but ceremonies and busy work at this time of year—and
I've come across a job offer you'll probably be interested in. Would
you like to meet the man who's offering it?"</p><p class="standard">	"Okay,
sure....Who is he?"</p><p class="standard">	"He
is the president of Angel Strike, a smaller software company owned by
Grantsoft."</p><p class="standard">	The
name sounded suspicious to Yuji, but he nodded. "Okay. Let's
meet him."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji's
father took him to the elevator and ascended with him to the 108th
floor. The glass door of the office bore a logo with the words Angel
Strike surrounding a winged pink staff. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
can't be seen here while Mr. Iphigenia speaks to you," said his
father. "It will look too much like nepotism. Come back to my
office when you're finished."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
nodded. "All right." His initial confusion was waning; he
now had a pretty good idea of what sort of job this might be, and if
he could make money doing it, he intended to. "Thanks, Dad."
His father nodded and left.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
went into the office. "Can I help you?" asked the
receptionist.</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
I'm here to speak with Mr. Iphigenia about the job," said Yuji.
"I'm Mr. Watanabe's son."</p><p class="standard">	"It'll
just be a few minutes. Take a seat."</p><p class="standard">	There
was a TV playing in the corner. 'General Hospital' was ending and
'Y/R' was coming on when a warning appeared across the bottom of the
screen. It read, <i>Breaking News: Hostage Situation at Robert Read
Remembrance Middle School. Stay tuned for more information.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>Yuji
did a double-take.</p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>As
soon as the opening of Y/R closed out, the SNC Channel 4 newscasters
came on. Robert Tainsh and Josephine Carter-Banks sat in front of a
map of the Pacific Region looking politely concerned.</p><p class="standard">	"Good
afternoon, I'm Robert Tainsh."</p><p class="standard">	"And
I'm Josephine Carter-Banks. We interrupt your regularly scheduled
programming with breaking news."</p><p class="standard">	The
camera showed the familiar outside of the school. The gates were
closed as they always were during school hours, and outside were
several white police cars. Policemen were wandering around in their
blue-and-white uniforms that had always reminded Yuji of the
Starfleet uniforms in <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>.</p><p class="standard">	The
voice of Josephine Carter-Banks spoke up. "Here we are at Robert
Read Remembrance Middle School, where just two hours ago police
received a call from a man claiming to be well-known esper criminal
Hayro Miba."</p><p class="standard">	Robert
Tainsh's voice took over. "Miba's demands are alleged to include
a transport plane to the Outer Rim for himself and five other high
profile esper criminals, and over five billion dollars in gold
bullion. The Sakura police department is asking everyone to remain
calm and stay in your homes and offices. If you cannot return home,
avoid large buildings such as malls and stadiums in favor of smaller
places. It is not known if Miba possesses the ability to teleport."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
sat transfixed in his seat. The school held hostage by an esper? It
seemed impossible. His friends were in danger. Allen, Mariko, and
Ai....and all the other students, most of whom he didn't like but
none of whom he wanted to see killed....It seemed impossible.</p><p class="standard">	Josephine
Carter-Banks took over again. "Miba first came to prominence in
1995 after the robbing of the First National Bank of England. He's
been in legal limbo ever since, incarcerated in a maximum security
esper facility in the vicinity of Virginia City, Nevada, but is
reported to have escaped last month when a clerical error resulted in
a missed round of sedatives for the detainee. Since then,
international police forces have been searching the Grand Zone for
Miba, but have found no sign of him—until now. Special
Correspondent Francisco Mario de la Cruz has more."</p><p class="standard">	"Interpol
and INAO advise us to report that Miba is a Class B esper measuring
seven STUs and four ADUs," said the wavy voice of Special
Correspondent Francisco Mario de la Cruz while the cameras continued
to show police milling around outside the school. "Now what this
means is that he is capable of dispatching seven fully-trained SWAT
members at one time, and destroying up to four average four-door
automobiles. He is known to be capable of telekinesis. Our
correspondents on scene tell me the police are currently trying to
find a way to cope with Miba's demands. They're just not equipped to
combat a Class B esper, and they feel that's the best way to ensure
no one gets hurt."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
stood up. "Hey, where're you going?" the receptionist
asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Nowhere.
I just....I have to go." He turned and ran out the door.</p><p class="standard">	The
elevator took too long to arrive, so Yuji ran down the stairs. He
knew he had to go. It was the same as when Butch hurt Ai and Allen,
but on a larger scale. Yuji would never have it said of him that he
only helped his friends when he knew he could trash the opponent. He
was a nyvamna too, Class C, five STUs and one ADU. Nyvamna fighting
nyvamna was so rare the INAO didn't bother measuring what his chances
were, but they had to be higher than a bunch of provincial cops with
old revolvers, and better than giving him what he wanted. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
exited the staircase on the 98th floor and took the elevator the rest
of the way down, passing his father's office on the way. The phone in
his father's office rang. His father picked up.</p><p class="standard">	"Has
he gone, Hiro?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
he just went by. Someone screwed up."</p><p class="standard">	"My
receptionist was watching television. They're covering it on the
news."</p><p class="standard">	"It'll
take him at least an hour to get back. Not to worry, Iphigenia."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	The
panic subsided into a vague swimming in Yuji's stomach as he waited
for the train. Trains to and from Sakura Memorial arrived and left
once every hour. It was still about fifteen minutes until the next
one. It seemed like eternity.</p><p class="standard">	Finally,
the train arrived and Yuji got on. Sitting on it felt like another
eternity. The train was completely empty—probably because it
was midday and no one was going to or leaving work, but it could also
be because no one wanted to go to Sakura Memorial when Hayro Miba was
there.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
knew it would take forty-five minutes or so to get back, and probably
another twenty to get to the school. <i>I can't do anything about it,
</i>he thought. <i>I just have to hope no one's been killed by then.
The cops won't have secured his demands. They can't have. Freeing
espers and getting transport planes takes a lot more than a few
hours.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>He
paced up and down the train until he found one of the racks of free
newspapers in a car containing exactly one other person, a man whose
bare, hairy legs showed beneath his trench coat. He hadn't been
thinking, of course. When the free newspaper was printed, there was
nothing to report but the newest quota of rape victims, car crashes,
and dogs who could dial the fire department. That probably would've
been all they printed anyway. The free newspaper (Yuji turned it over
and saw it was called <i>Island Plannerette</i>—it
must have been named during the vogue in adding a pseudo-French <i>-ette
</i>to the end of everything) would
report rape victims, car accidents, and phone-using dogs even through
the apocalypse.</p><p class="standard">	"Excuse
me, my boy," said the single occupant of the compartment. Yuji
jumped.</p><p class="standard">	"What
is it?"</p><p class="standard">	"Could
you tell me what the current time is?"</p><p class="standard">	"Sorry,
I can't."</p><p class="standard">	"I
wasn't asking a question. I was asking a riddle!"</p><p class="standard">	"What?"</p><p class="standard">	"That's
right! It's <i>enjo kousai </i>time! Ha ha!"</p><p class="standard">	"Oookay...."
Yuji left the compartment, dropping the free newspaper on the floor.</p><p class="standard">	He
couldn't stay seated. He paced back and forth in his compartment,
stared out the window at passing birds, and paced some more. He
thought about going back and getting the free newspaper so he'd have
something to read. He decided he didn't need to see Mr. "It's
<i>enjo kousai </i>time!" again.</p><p class="standard">	Unfortunately
Mr. "It's <i>enjo kousai </i>time!" decided he wanted to
see Yuji again near the end of the trip. He came into the
compartment, grinning like a madman. Yuji wondered if he was a serial
killer.</p><p class="standard">	"Hello,
my boy. Could you tell me what time it is?"</p><p class="standard">	"<i>Enjo
kousai </i>time," Yuji muttered dully. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Wrong!
It's blue sailor time!"</p><p class="standard">	"Ha
ha. Good one."</p><p class="standard">	"Listen,
I've got another riddle! And it goes like this: what time is it?"</p><p class="standard">	"Blue
sailor time."</p><p class="standard">	"Wrong!
It's lolicon pink salon time!"</p><p class="standard">	"Ha
ha. Good one. Listen, can you leave?"</p><p class="standard">	"But
we're only just getting started, my boy!"</p><p class="standard">	"We've
started and finished. Now it's time for you to leave."</p><p class="standard">	"By
the way my boy, do you know Richard Nixon? He's an old friend of
mine. We're currently having a bit of a disagreement about <i>enjo
kousai</i>, blue sailor, and lolicon pink salon! Ah ha ha."</p><p class="standard">	"Leave,
old man."</p><p class="standard">	"Old
man? Why yes, I suppose I <i>am </i>older than you! Ah ha ha!" 
</p><p class="standard">	"Get
out!"</p><p class="standard">	"Come
my boy, let's be friends."</p><p class="standard">	"Let's
not."</p><p class="standard">	"Well
well, very well then!" The man left cackling.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
had no energy to spare for the old freak. He drove the man out of his
mind. Sakura Memorial was in sight and he'd soon be back.</p><p class="standard">	He
got off at a station near the park. This station didn't run trains to
the school, but it didn't matter because the notice board informed
him there were no trains running into Midrash Terrace until the
hostage situation was resolved. He'd have to go on foot. And a
ten-minute train ride was a thirty-minute walk.</p><p class="standard">	Running
wouldn't do him any good, either. He set off walking. The streets
were nearly empty, which wasn't unusual for a Monday afternoon, but
there should have been at least a few people around. They became
emptier the closer he came to the school.</p><p class="standard">	<i>If
everyone's okay, I'll buy them ice cream when this is over, </i>he
thought. <i>Even Yumiko. </i>He reflected what a strange coincidence
it was that his father had asked him not to go to school on the very
day this happened. 
</p><p class="standard">	The
bright sun and chirping birds seemed to be mocking the gravity of
this situation. But somewhere in the Grand Zone, that sun was shining
on people whose friends weren't hostages. Yuji figured there was
probably some kind of epiphany hidden in there, but he couldn't see
what it was.</p><p class="standard">	Two
blocks or so from the school, he came in sight of the line of yellow
police tape holding back a crowd of forty or so idiots and several
reporters who wanted to breach the scene. Two police officers were
guarding the line. He wouldn't be able to get past there, but recent,
extensive cutting of PE and other classes towards the end of the day
had given Yuji a pretty good knowledge of the land around the school.</p><p class="standard">	The
school itself was situated in the crook of a small hill. The Cerise
River had run directly behind the school, but the government had
considered the presence of a river with high banks behind a middle
school undesirable. So perfect for suicide. Instead of building a
fence, they had split the river with a dam, so only a small tributary
ran behind the school now. West of the school was empty riverbed,
which had mostly been filled in with way stations. East of the school
was forest. Just a quick hop over the fence and he would be into the
field where Butch Christensen and the ROTC had been beating up Allen.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
went east around some empty lots and came into the trees. It was cool
and smelled damp. He tramped over dead leaves and fallen branches,
keeping an eye pointed to his right until the school came into sight,
and left the forest. 
</p><p class="standard">	There
were only two entrances on this side of the building, and both of
them were emergency fire escapes which would set off an alarm. He
couldn't alert whoever was inside to his presence. <i>Think Metal
Gear, </i>he told himself. <i>Stealth</i>. Although he didn't think
Miba had dumb, blind soldiers who would cry "I feel asleep!"
if struck pacing around inside.</p><p class="standard">	There
were three other entrances he knew of: the auditorium door on the
other side of the building, another fire escape door in the back, and
the main entrance. 
</p><p class="standard">	<i>I
wonder if broken windows set off an alarm? The problem is I don't
know where he is....It might be worth it to go around the back and
use the auditorium door.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	Maybe
you should rethink this alarm thing. It might scare him into slipping
up.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	Yeah,
it might also scare him into killing several hostages. </i>
</p><p class="standard"><i>	Guess
it's a tossup between the auditorium and the main entrance.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	The
main entrance is being watched by the cops. </i>
</p><p class="standard"><i>	Auditorium
it is.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>He
jumped the fence and went around the back of the building. It was
strange to see the basketball courts empty. There had never been a
time when he hadn't seen someone on the court yelling "I got
game!" or "It's my birthday, it's my birthday, uh huh!"
He opened the auditorium door a crack and peeked inside.</p><p class="standard">	"The
door's open, Mr. Miba, the door's open!" someone called. Yuji
slipped inside and shut it immediately.</p><p class="standard">	It
was pitch dark in the auditorium aside from the stage lights, and
standing under them was a bulky balding man with a week's worth of
beard. He was dressed in a beige and brown Hawaiian shirt and khaki
shorts. Yuji wondered if he'd robbed a tourist from Wisconsin to
assemble that wardrobe.</p><p class="standard">	"Who's
there?!" the man, presumably Miba, demanded.</p><p class="standard">	"No
one!" Yuji called, praying the man wasn't telepathic. "The
door opened on its own!"</p><p class="standard">	This
seemed to satisfy Miba, and he turned to the crowd again. "So
where was I? Oh, yes. The government thought they could lock me up in
a little craphole cell and keep me drugged all the time! Imagine
that! Me, Hayro Miba, the greatest esper this world has ever known!"
Some people laughed weakly, and this seemed to satisfy him. "But
I beat them! One of the nurses was mine. She gave me her body and her
mind. She never would have freed me, of course. But it wasn't long
before she neglected to drug me. I cracked that cell open and
escaped."</p><p class="standard">	"God,
what a boring story!" someone cried. A second later that someone
had run out on stage and popped Miba in the jaw. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
dashed for the stairs and hurtled up them. He felt his power engage,
and his feet didn't touch ground again until they hit the stage,
where he found himself facing Mariko, with Miba in between.</p><p class="standard">	Miba
summoned his telekinetic energy, and Yuji could feel the air around
him rippling like he was between two layers of plastic. Mariko
punched him again, and again, boxing his head like a punching bag.
Yuji leg-swept Miba's feet from under him, and the esper fell on his
back. The telekinetic blast he'd been summoning struck the roof,
blowing a stage light and pulling the curtain down. 
</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
kicked Miba in the side of the head at the same time Yuji's foot came
down in his solar plexus. Next thing Yuji knew he and Mariko had been
lofted by an invisible force and thrown into opposite walls. Yuji's
unfocused eyes could see the telekinetic energy as a vague distortion
around Miba's form. He saw a blob of it lengthen and fly at him.
Invisible fingers were clamped around his neck.</p><p class="standard">	"You
interrupted me!" Miba roared. "No one interrupts me!"
The fingers tightened, gagging Yuji. On instinct, he reached up to
seize them and his hands passed through thin air.</p><p class="standard">	Another
tendril of force grabbed Mariko by the ankle and held her in the air
upside-down. A third lifted the curtain again, exposing a room full
of teenagers running like hell.</p><p class="standard">	"Sit
down!" Miba ordered. Those nearest the doors simply ran, but
those in the center obeyed. "Now—these two—they are
going to...." He trailed off.</p><p class="standard">	As
his breathing became more restricted, Yuji felt a tingling sensation,
like excitement. It began in his extremities and slowly spread
through his entire body, and now he knew that telekinesis was really
not much. It was dangerous, but not unbeatable, not now that he could
touch it. He grabbed the trail of psychic energy and threw it off,
simple as removing a backpack. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
leapt into the air and drove a side kick into Miba's pectoral just as
Miba blasted him with a wave of psychic power. It had all Miba's
power behind it, and Yuji felt it push him like the blast of a fire
hose. Miba put more power into the blast, dropping Mariko and the
curtain, and Yuji felt his T-shirt split in two down the front. His
outer shirt was flapping around him, its ends shredding into rags.
The stage lights were popping left and right, showering them with
sparks.</p><p class="standard">	"Eat
this!" Mariko yelled, punching Miba with all her might.
Electricity burst from her fist, crackling like a bag of popcorn in
the microwave.</p><p class="standard">	The
wave pushing against Yuji vanished and he landed on his feet. Miba
staggered towards the edge of the stage; Yuji could tell he hadn't
counted on running into any kind of fight. He sprung into the crowd
on legs powered by telekinesis, grabbed a few of the nearest
teenagers, and made for the doors back into the main building.</p><p class="standard">	"No
you don't!" Mariko cried, jumping off the stage and running for
him, but she was too far away.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
ran at the edge and leapt. He floated down like a hang-glider,
drifting down on a graceful peak, and kicked Miba in the back of the
head, knocking him flat. The students Miba had seized landed in a
pile all around him. In the dim light, Yuji noticed one of them was
Yumiko. He landed hard on Miba's back. Something cracked under his
feet—probably a rib. Miba let out a low groan. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Mariko?"
Yumiko said.</p><p class="standard">	"Yo!"
Mariko called, coming up behind him.</p><p class="standard">	"You
didn't take him out? Then who—?"</p><p class="standard">	"No
one," said Yuji. If she didn't recognize him he wasn't going to
tell her. "Miba's out cold. Someone drag him outside and give
him to the cops. I'm taking off." He left, kicking Miba once
more on the way. Mariko followed him through the auditorium door into
the sunlight.</p><p class="standard">	"You'd
better go back," said Yuji. "I wasn't in school today, but
they'll notice you gone."</p><p class="standard"> 	"I'm
not worried about that," said Mariko. "It's just....You
stole my thunder, Yuji!"</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?
You can take all the credit for beating him, go ahead."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
not good enough! We are going on a date, tomorrow at six!"</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?"</p><p class="standard">	"And
afterwards, we're going to a romantic hotel which you will book with
your own money!"</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?"</p><p class="standard">	"Just
kidding. Get outta here, I'll wrap up." She went back inside,
leaving Yuji puzzled.

        <p class="standard">	Yumiko
poured some of the bottle into Mariko's and Ai's glasses, then raised
it. <i>"Kanpai," </i>she said, taking a swig from it.
Mariko downed her glass, and finally so did Ai.</p><p class="standard">	All
three winced. "That's....strong," Ai mumbled.</p><p class="standard">	"Packs
a kick," Mariko agreed. She set her glass down.</p><p class="standard">	"Is
there a legal drinking age here?" Ai asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Not
really," said Yumiko, pouring them all another round.</p><p class="standard">	"It's
supposed to be eighteen, but if you look old enough they won't check
your ID," said Mariko. "Poor Yumi looks old enough."</p><p class="standard">	"You'd
be surprised how old Mariko can look when she takes her hair out of
that stupid nibuta," said Yumiko idly. She took another swig
from the bottle.</p><p class="standard">	"If
you come in drunk they'll probably ask for it, though," Mariko
added. She downed her second glass and winced again. "That's why
you buy everything off the top from different stores."</p><p class="standard">	"You
sure have thought this through," Ai commented. She stared at the
brown liquid in her glass. She could smell it from two feet away.</p><p class="standard">	"My
sister taught me," said Mariko. "Go on, drink up. It's on
Yumiko."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
hesitated, then downed it. The stuff really was vile.</p><p class="standard">	"That
was pretty damn cool how you talked him down," Yumiko addressed
Ai. "Miba. Proved you aren't just some cutesy-wootsy<i> </i>pink
salon brat."</p><p class="standard">	"Ah....it
wasn't much. I knew he'd see the sense in it."</p><p class="standard">	"That
bastard was gonna let us sit there listening to him babble 'til we
pissed ourselves! You talked him into letting us go to the bathroom.
What'd you do anyway, sleep with him or something?"</p><p class="standard">	Ai
blushed. "N-no....I just talked....just told him people degraded
like that might get desperate and try something. It was nothing
really...."</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
shortchange yourself kid," said Mariko as Yumiko poured another
round. The bottle was about half-empty. This time Ai drank right away
to get it over with. "Of course, it was nothing next to what I
did—"</p><p class="standard">	"We
know, we know, Mariko is the conquering hero," Yumiko sighed.
"Write a book about it."</p><p class="standard">	"—but
most of them were too terrified to move or make a peep. You were
really brave."</p><p class="standard">	"I
was terrified as well," said Ai. Yumiko was pouring another
round. Ai didn't think she could handle three more glasses of
whatever sort of antifreeze was in that bottle. "It's just,
there was a seventh grader next to me who'd already had an accident
from fear, and she was crying....I didn't want everyone to end up
that way. Um, Mariko! There was someone up there helping you when you
were fighting him! Who was it?" She thought she knew already,
but it would get the attention off her.</p><p class="standard">	"It
was Yuji. You couldn't tell? He said you knew he was a nyvamna."</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,"
Yumiko scoffed. She was already making the rounds a fifth time, but
Ai hadn't finished her fourth yet. "Go on Ai, drink." Ai
did. The burning didn't seem to be something you got used to; it was
worse every time Ai drank. "That milquetoast I saw on your
birthday? Rat-faced scrawny ass, nothing quick or wise about him but
his witty retorts? He couldn't do what that guy did. Tell us who it
really was."</p><p class="standard">	"It
was really him," said Mariko. Yumiko made to pour Ai another,
but Ai waved her off.</p><p class="standard">	"No
thanks. I've had enough."</p><p class="standard">	"C'mon.
Drink!"</p><p class="standard">	"No
thanks. I....I don't hold my liquor well."</p><p class="standard">	"You
can stop when you're drunk." Yumiko filled Ai's glass and
smiled. Even a leery smile like this one made her less like a dead
fish. "C'mon. Dream with me."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	"See?
You hold your liquor well. Hold it like a barmy cart," said
Yumiko.</p><p class="standard">	"It's
you who don't hold your bloody liquor," said Mariko. She was
starting to sound Australian again.</p><p class="standard">	"It's
warm in here, isn't it?" said Ai. "I'll turn on the air."</p><p class="standard">	"No,
stay there. I wanna bounce some ideas off you," said Yumiko. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?"</p><p class="standard">	"Listen."
But before speaking, she cracked open their third bottle and poured
them all another round. The first two had been some kind of vile
stuff more suited for cleaning jewelry than drinking, but this was a
decent bottle of peach-flavored white wine that Mariko had found in
the cupboard. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't know if we should be drinking my mother's wine," said Ai
doubtfully.</p><p class="standard">	"Aw
c'mon! You said she's out getting plastered with some guy anyway,
what's the harm." 
</p><p class="standard">	"Does
that make sense?" Ai asked Mariko. "I think I've drunk a
bit too much to tell."</p><p class="standard">	"Not
really." Mariko accepted a glass of wine and tossed it back in
one shot. When Yumiko made to pour for Ai, she held her hands up.</p><p class="standard">	"Really,
I've had enough. I can't stop blushing."</p><p class="standard">	"You
can't stop blushin' anyway." Yumiko poured Ai another glass. The
alcohol was obviously taking its toll on her brain, but her hand was
steady as ever. It was a neat trick. "C'mon, I wanned do this
cause I didn't give ya a fair chance first time we met. We girls
got'a stick ogether ya know. Now you. Yre purdy and quiet, so ya make
a bad impression on a plain, loud girl like me. Bu'chre knave." 
</p><p class="standard">	"Knave?"</p><p class="standard">	"Knaive."</p><p class="standard">	"Naive?"</p><p class="standard">	"Thassa
one. Knaive and low self-steam. So that makes ya a target,
ge'wh'msay'n'? Target fr da meatballs lookin fr booty caw. Caw. Call.
Cæll. Hmph. Thassa one."</p><p class="standard">	"What
are you talking about, Miss Yumiko?"</p><p class="standard">	"Don'
call me 'miss!' I ain't ya grannie. Call. Cæll. Caw. Hmph.
Grannie. Anyway, wh'msay'n' is, a purdy grl like y'all needs a grl
like me 'n' Mariko to save ya. Here's whatcha do. Wait 'til ya meet a
prince. A rich one. A dumb one. Not a one like Hamlet wi all his
'tbeer nottabe.' He'd see through ya. Then, don't screw him 'til he
marries ya. Then do wha'evr he wans fr year er two. Then divorce his
ass. Take his palace, his servnts, his Corvette, 'n' all 'at jazz.
Getcha?"</p><p class="standard">	"Is
that the idea you wanted to bounce off me?"</p><p class="standard">	"No!
Tha's no an idea. Tha's jus common sense. Now this is an idea. Lissen
y'all. The future's comin. Some say the future's alrea'y here. If we
wanna keep up, we gotta keep up. An y'know how we keep up? Jobs. We
gotta have good future jobs."</p><p class="standard">	"Does
that make any sense?" Ai asked Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"Not
really." Mariko poured herself another and tossed it back in one
go. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Now
me, I already know a good future job I'm gonna go for. Y'wanna know
what that is?"</p><p class="standard">	"Something
with computers?" Ai suggested.</p><p class="standard">	"A
plumber," said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"Nope.
You're thinkin the near future. I'm talkin the future future! And the
future is sculpting."</p><p class="standard">	"What?"</p><p class="standard">	"Can
ya see me as a sculptor?"</p><p class="standard">	"Like
Leonardo da Vinci? And Donatello and Michelangelo and Raphael?"</p><p class="standard">	"No!
A sculptor, not a Ninja Turtle. Pitcher dis: me. A sculptor. And
sculpting."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
drained the bottle of wine and yawned. "I'm exhausted...."</p><p class="standard">	"If
you like, I can take you home," Ai offered.</p><p class="standard">	"No!"
Mariko yelled, making Ai jump. "I'll go nawhere near that bloody
home!"</p><p class="standard">	"Hey,
lissen y'all. Let's us go find out how t'be sculptors," said
Yumiko. She stood up.</p><p class="standard">	"No,
no....I really think it would be better if you just went home and
slept it off," said Ai.</p><p class="standard">	"Frget
that! C'mon, less go!"</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
went out the door. Mariko loped after her, and Ai supposed she'd
better go along and make sure they didn't get in trouble. Not that
she'd be able to do much if they did.</p><p class="standard">	It
was a balmy evening with a slight breeze. The moon was nearly full
and cloud cover was light. It couldn't have been more perfect for
pursuing drunken adventures. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Where
do you go to become a sculptor?" Ai asked. 
</p><p class="standard">	"The
park, o' course!" Yumiko answered. Ai didn't think that made
sense, but she'd drunk too much to tell, and Mariko was clearly no
help.</p><p class="standard">	They
boarded a train bound for the park. It was completely empty save for
a man whose bare, hairy legs showed under his trench coat. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Excuse
me, my good girls!" he called when he saw them. "Can you
tell me what time it is?"</p><p class="standard">	"Er...."

</p><p class="standard">	"That's
right! It's blue sailor<i> </i>time! Now who wants to make some
money?"</p><p class="standard">	"How
cn you cntribute to the degeneracy of the young? Ya disgustin'
pervert!" Yumiko spat.</p><p class="standard">	"I'll
do it," said Mariko. She took off her watch and handed it to
him. "That'll be twenty-five dollars."</p><p class="standard">	"There's
a good girl!" The man sniffed the watchband and giggled. "Here
you go!" He gave her two bills.</p><p class="standard">	"Wait,
me too!" said Yumiko. She took off her glasses, polished them
with a piece of cloth, and gave him the cloth. "That'll be
twenty-five dollars." The man sniffed the cloth and giggled.
"Here you go!" He gave her two bills and turned to Ai
expectantly.</p><p class="standard">	"Oh....I
don't know....Here." She dug in the pocket of her skirt for a
hair clip. "Twenty-five dollars."</p><p class="standard">	The
man sniffed the clip and giggled. "Here you go!" He gave
her two bills. "Thank you! Such nice girls, giving me your
unmentionables like that! Hee hee!" 
</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
mention it," said Mariko. 
</p><p class="standard">	Ai
began to giggle uncontrollably. "Don't....mention it!
See....it's unmentionables....so don't mention it!" 
</p><p class="standard">	"Heidy!
Highdy!" the trench-coated man called as the exited the train.</p><p class="standard">	"All
right," said Yumiko. "We've got money. Park. Scolptor.
Thass what we're doin. Righ." 
</p><p class="standard">	"Where're
we going in the park?" asked Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"The
museum, o' course."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
thought that might make sense, but she'd drunk a bit too much to
tell. 
</p><p class="standard">	They
got off the train near the mall and crossed under the cherry trees to
the gondola dock. Yumiko paid for them to ride across while Ai picked
pink blossoms out of her hair and Mariko stared blankly.</p><p class="standard">	The
suburban kid rowing them across tried to grope Ai as she stepped into
the boat. Ai moved to the front of the gondola, leaving him with
Mariko, who looked capable of murder. As they rowed over he tried to
serenade them in bad Italian. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Uh-bluh
bluh bluh bluh bluh dreamarello, uh-bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh
amorello, uh-bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh tip-a-fellow!" No one
offered him a tip.</p><p class="standard">	"Is
the museum in the mall?" asked Ai. She'd drunk a bit too much to
know.</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
this's it right up there," said Yumiko, pointing to the top
floor. They boarded an escalator going up.</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
this is the arcade," Ai mentioned.</p><p class="standard">	"Perfec'
place 'o start," said Yumiko. She went in. Mariko followed, and
then Ai.</p><p class="standard">	The
lights were on inside, which wasn't usual for the arcade. Games were
better in the dark. But most of the people inside right now weren't
playing games; they were sitting around wooden folding tables playing
with cards. Ai stopped and glanced over someone's shoulder. The cards
in his hand weren't typical playing cards; one of them said 'Big Fat
Polly' and featured a drawing of a parrot with crazed eyes and huge
tearing talons. Another seemed to be called 'Ginsu Flame Man' and
featured a man in white armor wielding a large blood-soaked knife.</p><p class="standard">	"I
think this is a trading card tournament," said Ai, when she
realized Yumiko and Mariko had gone ahead while she was looking at
the cards. She caught up to them. "Um, guys? I think this is a
trading card tournament. So maybe we should go. We won't become
sculptors here."</p><p class="standard">	"What're
you talkin' 'bout?" said Yumiko. "Dis is da prfect place
become a sculptor! Let's talk to some o' these guys! C'mon, let's
split up!" She and Mariko both stalked off into the jungle of
game machines, leaving Ai alone. She sighed and went off in her own
direction. 
</p><p class="standard">	One
of the tables she passed contained the strangest thing she'd ever
seen, and she wondered if it was real or if she'd drunk too much to
tell. Two men who had to be in their seventies were sitting at a
table, dueling with their trading cards. They were wrinkled and had
spotty scalps, and one was wearing a hearing aid.</p><p class="standard">	“Sonic
Striker, destroy his Blade Magician with your Mach Scream!”
cried the first old man excitedly.</p><p class="standard">	“No,
I play a counter-booby trap that raises my Blade Magician’s
attack points to thirty-five hundred!” retorted the second old
man, flipping over a card.</p><p class="standard">	“It’s
not booby trap, you old fool, it’s just trap!”</p><p class="standard">	“I’ll
call it what I want to! You see if I don't!” The second old man
tapped a finger on one of his cards, then tapped one of his
opponent’s.</p><p class="standard">	“And
you should announce your attacks, you senile old fool!”</p><p class="standard">	“I
don’t have to!”</p><p class="standard">	“It
says to in the instruction manual!”</p><p class="standard">	“To
hell with the instruction manual!”</p><p class="standard">	"Excuse
me," said Ai, attracting the attention of both old men. She
could feel their eyes scouring her for cracks in her armor. Her
facial blood was already at maximum, so she couldn't blush any more,
but she felt embarrassed all the same. "Um, this is a trading
card convention, right?"</p><p class="standard">	"Sure
is, little miss," said the man with the hearing aid. 
</p><p class="standard">	"But
it's at night."</p><p class="standard">	"Nothing
gets by you, does it?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
just mean....doesn't the mall usually close at nine?"</p><p class="standard">	"Usually,
yes, but they agreed to stay open so's all us who loves Dueling
Creatures but doesn't wanna play against some little brat, like, had
somewhere to meet up. Dammit, ya old fool, ya can't play a trap in
your second standby phase!"</p><p class="standard">	"I
can play a trap whenever I darn well want!" the other man
retaliated.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
decided that further conversation with these two was likely to be
unprofitable, so she left. She stopped again a few tables down to
listen to a business transaction that was taking place. A
fourteen-year-old boy who was probably Japanese, judging by his small
stature, was trying to sell something to a huge fat teenager in a red
Transformers shirt.</p><p class="standard">	"Now
c'mon man, I'm giving you a deal here," said the
fourteen-year-old.</p><p class="standard">	"You're
a eddiot if you think this is a deal," said the huge fat guy. 
</p><p class="standard">	"A
Manreeki the Unforgiving One for eight hundred dollars? That's like
giving it away! It's like I'm robbing myself!"</p><p class="standard">	"Your
Manreeki looks like someone wiped theirself with it. I'll give you
five bucks. That's all it's worth."</p><p class="standard">	"You
kidding man! This is a complete Manreeki the Unforgiving One!"</p><p class="standard">	"It's
got fingerprints on it. And look at the Third Arm on the Right to the
Left Side Six Floors Down of the Unforgiving One—it’s got a
bent corner! And the Fifth Leg on the Nth Power equal to the Square
Root of the Three Remaining Sides of an Isosceles Triangle of the
Unforgiving One has got a stripped edge! And just look at all those
fingerprints! You totally ruined it!"</p><p class="standard">	The
younger kid whistled. "Man! You actually know the names of the
cards!"</p><p class="standard">	"Of
course." Ai peeked over his shoulder and saw that the writing on
the card he'd just named was '5th Leg (n<sup>n</sup>)=Ö
Ñ(/3)of the Unforgiving One.'
Evidently, math had not been the forte of the card game's developers.</p><p class="standard">	"Okay,
I'll give you the set for one-fifty."</p><p class="standard">	"Only
if you got a hot sister to get me laid."</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?"
The younger kid was stunned. "But—I
only have a younger sister!"</p><p class="standard">	"Then
no deal." The huge fat kid left. The younger kid started crying.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
sat down across from him. "Are you okay?"</p><p class="standard">	"No....The
truth is....my parents died recently, and they're gonna take my
sister away if I don't make some money. So I thought if I sold my
cards, maybe I could make some bucks and we wouldn't be
separated....."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
a lie," said Ai. "You want the money so you can hire a lady
of the evening. You're horrible. You're nauseating and repellent. No
girl will come near you because you still eat your own boogers."
She stopped. "Sorry. I'm drunk."</p><p class="standard">	"No....it's
all true. I knew it, too....I just had to hear it. Um, listen....how
did you know? Are you an angel? A magical girl who's come to save me
from my life of desperate bachelorhood?"</p><p class="standard">	"No,"
said Ai. "I'm drunk." 
</p><p class="standard">	She
left the kid crying to look for the ladies' room. It was getting
warm, and she wanted to wash her face. Maybe after that she would
have a can of coffee. That might help drive off the alcohol. 
</p><p class="standard">	As
she was entering the door she felt someone squeeze her bottom like a
soft fruit. Not gently, either. She jumped and whirled around. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Hey,
I'm Hans. You're pretty hot. Wanna get a room?" said the huge
fat guy who could pronounce the names of Manreeki the Unforgiving
One's component parts.</p><p class="standard">	It
could have been the rotgut, but Ai felt like she was standing in a
field of decaying bodies. Her stomach twisted itself into sailor's
knots and then untwisted. 
</p><p class="standard">	Someone
cried out in the bathroom. Ai went inside to investigate. Hans
followed her and propped the door open. "Can I have your phone
number?" he asked.</p><p class="standard">	"C'mon
babe, don't fight it...." insisted a grown man in dental
headgear. He was wrestling someone into the end stall. Ai caught
freckles, glasses, and brown hair and realized it was Yumiko.</p><p class="standard">	"No—frickin'—way!"
Yumiko cried, pushing on the man in the headgear. Ai tried to take
hold of him from behind and pull him out. She struggled with his
flailing limbs, trying to avoid losing an eye to his headgear. She
felt Hans cop another feel from behind, then heard someone pop him. 
</p><p class="standard">	<i>"Ya
damned card-freaks ya maybe wanna get your frickin' white asses outta
me bloody way!" </i>Mariko roared. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
just want her to play cards with me!" shrieked the man in the
headgear. Mariko pushed Ai out of the way and seized him by the arms.
She yanked him off Yumiko, fought him into the neighboring stall, and
stuck him headfirst in the toilet. Yumiko came out of the end stall
and helped Mariko do the same to Hans.</p><p class="standard">	<i>"Ya
bloody freaks'd better keep ya damn hands off!</i>....hey."</p><p class="standard">	"This
didn't work," said Yumiko as they left the ladies' room. "We
better find us somewhere else to become sculptors. But first I need a
drink."</p><p class="standard">	"Who
would think that three drunk girls crash a trading card tournament
and it's the trading card guys who end up making trouble?" said
Ai.</p><p class="standard">	"Think?
Nobody. Nobody <i>thought </i>it. We <i>dreamed </i>it, Princess.
Together."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	They
left the mall with no definite course and took a gondola back to the
shores of the lake. There were lights on the far end, near the
swimming area, that suggested someone was there.</p><p class="standard">	"Hey,
let's go check that out!" said Yumiko. "I bet they got
something to drink...."</p><p class="standard">	They
hiked around the edge of the lake away from the glowing tower of the
mall. "What do you suppose that is?" Ai asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Looks
to me like a party," said Yumiko. "Only one type of person
who'd be having a party out here at three in the morning, eh?"</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
it's only ten-fifteen," Ai mentioned.</p><p class="standard">	"Details!
Anyway, I bet they got drinks. We quench our thirst, then we go find
the museum and become a sculptor."</p><p class="standard">	As
they came closer, it seemed Yumiko was right. Five or six people were
having a party around a portable gas grill. The ratio of men to women
seemed pretty uneven—there was only one
teenage boy, but three grown women and three teenage girls. The
nearest to them was a buxom purple-haired woman who was sitting by
the path in a beach chair, wearing a bikini that matched her hair
color. Next to her was an open ice chest with beer and wine coolers
inside.</p><p class="standard">	"'Scuse
me!" Yumiko called. "Got a drink for a few parched
travelers?"</p><p class="standard">	The
woman looked up, and Ai realized she had pointy ears. "She's an
elf!" she whispered.</p><p class="standard">	<i>"Nija
aruceya?" </i>the elf-woman said.</p><p class="standard">	"Sure,"
Yumiko replied to Ai. "Tons of them live across the river. Ask
her for a drink."</p><p class="standard">	Not
at all confident in her Elvish abilities, Ai tried to begin.
"Umm....<i>nimia? Bincan es nimia?"</i></p><p class="standard">	<i>"Aaaah.
Aë. Ciph u nimia quon." </i>
</p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>"What'd
she say?" Yumiko asked.</p><p class="standard">	"I
think she said yes." 
</p><p class="standard">	The
woman seemed to understand this word, and she nodded. "Yes. Yes
I says. Have drink. <i>Muyocara."</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	"Muyocara,
muyocara. Wapho," </i>replied
Ai. Yumiko and Mariko had already dug in. Both took beer and drank
deeply. Ai chose a peach wine cooler and drank slowly, enjoying the
cool drink in the warm night.</p><p class="standard">	"Your
name....what?" the elf-woman asked.</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
Yumiko, this is Mariko, and the princess is Ai. You?"</p><p class="standard">	"My....name....Ishinobu."</p><p class="standard">	"Hey,
Ishinobu!" called the brunette woman who was running the grill.
"Who're your friends!"</p><p class="standard">	Ishinobu
sent a long string of Mestaera back at her, which she didn't seem to
understand any better than Yumiko had. A tall blonde woman translated
for her. 
</p><p class="standard">	"We
just stopped by to see if you guys had a drink to spare!" called
Yumiko. "We're thirsty!" She raised her beer.</p><p class="standard">	"Want
some hamburgers too? They're almost ready!" the brunette woman
called back.</p><p class="standard">	"Let's,
I'm starving," Ai whispered.</p><p class="standard">	"They
could poison us," said Yumiko.</p><p class="standard">	"Would
they?"</p><p class="standard">	"You
never know. It's strange. Real strange." She called to the
brunette woman, "Sure, thanks a lot!"</p><p class="standard">	"Great!
C'mon and meet everybody!"</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
and Mariko both took a second beer before they went. Ai followed, her
wine cooler only half gone.</p><p class="standard">	"So
your names are Yumiko, Mariko, and Ai?"</p><p class="standard">	"That's
right," said Yumiko.</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
Sayoko," said the brunette woman. She indicated the blonde
woman, who was also an elf. "This is Mimbaln. Over there,"
she pointed down to the water, "are Kayoko, Kaorin, Chiono, and
Alphira. Kayoko and Kaorin are my nephew and niece."</p><p class="standard">	"I
c'n tell from the family r'sembl'nce," said Yumiko. Kayoko and
Kaorin were both brunettes like their aunt. Chiono was small and
dark-haired, and Alphira was another elf, with deep black skin, hair
that matched, and auburn eyes.</p><p class="standard">	"Hey
guys! Food's done!" Sayoko called. The four teenagers came in
and introduced themselves to the three girls as they helped set the
picnic blanket.</p><p class="standard">	"How
did you guys end up here this late?" Kayoko asked them.</p><p class="standard">	"Actually,
we're drunk," said Ai.</p><p class="standard">	For
some reason they all laughed as if that was funny. "No, it's the
truth," Ai persisted. "I'm just sober enough to remember.
These two are in space right now."</p><p class="standard">	Everyone
laughed again. "Some cole slaw, Ai?" Mimbaln offered.</p><p class="standard">	"Oh—sure.
Thank you." Ai took the container and served herself. "Wow,
this is amazing! Who made this?"</p><p class="standard">	"Guilty
as charged," said Kayoko.</p><p class="standard">	"Where
did you learn?"</p><p class="standard">	"Ishinobu
taught him," said Mimbaln. "She'd love to take credit, but
she's a little out to lunch right now as well, and she doesn't like
to speak English in front of strangers."</p><p class="standard">	<i>"Inglis
arucedh so filima," </i>Ishinobu apologized. <i>"Bina
Inglis hindo."</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>"Yes,
she understands quite well," Mimbaln agreed. "Kayoko
teaches her some. He's a fair Mestaera speaker. And me, of course.
But the largest help was Shinjo. She's left now."</p><p class="standard">	"Do
you live in a boarding house or something?" Ai asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
it's all a little strange. Kayoko's parents passed the house to
Sayoko, and before long we were all living there. I'm one of the
late-comers, but my sister Mirufa and Shinjo's sister Jinjo lived
there quite a while. They've both gone to the Outer Rim now to join
with Princess Arishil." She said so with distinct pride.</p><p class="standard">	"Princess
Arishil?"</p><p class="standard">	"You
haven't heard of her?"</p><p class="standard">	"I....I've
only lived here a few weeks."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
I see. Princess Arishil is the last scion of the Fung Royal Family.
Her father and mother ruled the Outer Rim, but she gave up the power
and now it's come under the rule of numerous human kingdoms."</p><p class="standard">	"Is
she human? Or....an elf?"</p><p class="standard">	Mimbaln
seemed slightly appalled at the thought. <i>"Nas es Vactir</i>,
no, no. Princess Arishil is a faerie. Nearly the last of the
pure-blooded ones, too; most of them have died, many of them have
turned against her, and all of them crossbreed nowadays."</p><p class="standard">	"How
sad," Ai remarked.</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
it is. The end of a people is never pretty. We elves are approaching
our end now as well. There may be more of us living beyond the Outer
Rim, but we'll never know. Any craft that tries to leave the Grand
Zone is torn apart by high winds. But I don't mean to speak of such
boring things! This is a party."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
not bored," said Ai, and she blushed a little. Her drunkenness
must be fading. She turned and got another wine cooler from the
chest. "I think it's interesting."</p><p class="standard">	"Hey
Princess! Time 'o get goin'!" Yumiko called.</p><p class="standard">	"What?
But I haven't finished—"</p><p class="standard">	"You're
welcome to stay," said Sayoko.</p><p class="standard">	"Sorry
lady, you've been real kind to 's 'n' all, but it's time we got
goin'."</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
all right, but take our address. Drop by if you're ever across the
river."</p><p class="standard">	The
three girls left the party, Ai reluctantly. "I wanted to stay
and talk to them some more."</p><p class="standard">	"Couldn't,"
Yumiko answered. "If let parties an' stuff stop us from becomin
sculptors, we'll nevr b'come sclptrs They're real nice 'n' all, but
we gotta b'come sclptrs fr aar futcher. Ya unnerstan."</p><p class="standard">	"Well....I
suppose, yes."</p><p class="standard">	"So
let's get goin t' the museem!"</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	The
museum lay in the cleft of a hill about half a mile from the lake.
The mall was still visible as a huge rod of light against the
horizon. 
</p><p class="standard">	The
museum was built in a Gothic style. In the dark and against the
backdrop of the moon, it was an imposing sight. Werewolves or
vampires could live inside this building. Maidens could be trapped
under the thumb of a sadistic nobleman. Ai shivered at the thought.
"Is it open?"</p><p class="standard">	"Prob'ly
not. But we c'n g't in anyway," said Yumiko. She led the way up
the path, Mariko stalking after her like a silent ghost. The tall
glass doors were shut and the lights were out. "There's someone
inside. I'm tellin' ya."</p><p class="standard">	Next
moment a voice called in a fake accent, "Why dahling, there are
people here!"</p><p class="standard">	"Damn
right we're here," said Yumiko. "Let us in."</p><p class="standard">	"Who
are we, dahling?"</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
Yumiko, 'n' m'friends are c'lled Mariko and Ai." She said the
next part very carefully. "We want to be a sculptor."</p><p class="standard">	The
door swung open. "Do come in, dahling." Yumiko tramped in.
Mariko wafted in after her, and Ai reluctantly followed.</p><p class="standard">	Once
they'd entered, the door closed behind them and a spotlight came on,
blinding them for a moment. Its light fell on a girl who looked about
eighteen. Her natural hair color seemed to be orange, but in the
front it was dyed three different colors: dark red on the right, lime
green in the middle, and navy blue on the left.</p><p class="standard">	"Hello
dears, I'm Yunoki Amano and I'm a lesbian," she introduced
herself. "Less importantly, I'm also a painter. Come, come into
the light where I can see you."</p><p class="standard">	The
three girls came forward into the spotlight. Yunoki Amano spent a few
minutes inspecting Yumiko, then moved on to Mariko. Finally she came
to Ai. She hardly even looked at Ai before going back to Mariko and
crying, "Dahling! You're perfect! I must have your body!"</p><p class="standard">	"Eh?"

</p><p class="standard">	"You're
so perfect dahling, masculine yet feminine, sexy like a man but also
a woman, any lesbian would want you, need you, have to have you
dahling!"</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?"</p><p class="standard">	"You
can't have Mariko!" Yumiko declared. "She's mine!"</p><p class="standard">	"Are
you a lesbian too dahling?"</p><p class="standard">	"No.
I'm just a girl, who loves another girl, and won't let some filthy
lesbian painter steal her from me!"</p><p class="standard">	"Eh?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
only want to paint her, dahling, and immortalize her in pigment."</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
how did you get in here?" Ai asked.</p><p class="standard">	Yunoki
glared at her and said, "I slept with the curator's daughter,
dahling, and she gave me a key. Being here inspires me and I'm able
to paint better."</p><p class="standard">	"Mariko,
are you really going to let her do this?" Yumiko asked.</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
shrugged. "Eh."</p><p class="standard">	Yunoki
seemed to take that for a yes. She dragged her easel and her supplies
into the spotlight and set up a fresh canvas. While she prepared, Ai
looked around the lobby. She could see tall statues looming all
around them in the darkness like cannibals in the jungle. It seemed
possible for the huge dark figures to come alive and set upon them.</p><p class="standard">	Her
thoughts were broken by a loud chorus of, "I feel so chahming,
it's alahming how chahming I feel!" Yunoki was singing as she
swept her brush across the canvas, capturing Mariko's body. Mariko's
shoulders were slumped like a gorilla. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
feel singing is an important part of the artistic process,"
Yunoki announced. "Dahling, turn left just a tidgy-widgy. Now,
put one foot in front of the other! And soon you'll be strolling
'cross the floo-oo-oor! Because wherever I go, I'll go there with
you! We will be to-ge-ther—in the big
open blue!" She pronounced <i>blue </i>like <i>bleeuw</i>.</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
began to polish her glasses on her shirttail. "I've never been
so glad to be ugly in my life."</p><p class="standard">	"May
I see those for a second?" asked Ai. Yumiko gave her the
glasses. She put them on and looked around again. Everything was
blurred to the point that it was impossible to distinguish individual
shapes, only a patch of light and a patch of darkness. "Your
vision must be pretty bad."</p><p class="standard">	"It's
'orrible," Yumiko agreed. "Couldn't see a thing 'til I got
those. I didn't learn a thing 'til fourth grade, and I'm stupid
anyway, which just made it worse. Made me even uglier, too. You look
good though. The unassuming bookworm who all the nerds want, that's
you in those all 'round. It balances you kind of. You don't look so
much like a princess."</p><p class="standard">	"You're
not ugly," said Ai. "If you'd just smile, you'd be
beautiful."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
like saying if a monkey would just shave and walk on two legs, he'd
be human. It's not logical."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
took off the glasses and returned them. "How did you know what I
looked like if you can't see without these?"</p><p class="standard">	"Intuition."</p><p class="standard">	"La
la la, and it's ready!" Yunoki declared. "Dahling, have a
look."</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
and Ai joined Mariko on each side to have a look at the painting.
None of them knew what to expect, but it certainly wasn't the
monstrosity that confronted them. Yunoki didn't seem to have done any
actual painting at all—she'd simply
splattered paint all over the canvas, like a drunk Jackson Pollock.</p><p class="standard">	"That
supposed to be Mariko?" 
</p><p class="standard">	"Of
course it is dahling! Behold the noble curve of her chin! The
wondrous cleft of her breasts! The masculine yet feminine carriage of
the shoulders! I call it—'Nitetime
Museum Girl: A Newde Concordance.' It is my greatest work yet."</p><p class="standard">	If
this was her greatest work, Ai didn't know what her lesser ones would
be like. She'd seen fingerpaintings done with more skill. Mariko
stared at the thing. 
</p><p class="standard">	<i>"That
piece 'a crap don't look nothin' like me at all!" </i>she
bellowed, seizing the canvas and tossing it on the ground. She
smashed it in two with her heel.</p><p class="standard">	"What
are you doing?! Stop that! Stop destroying my work!" Yunoki
screamed.</p><p class="standard">	<i>"This
bloody crap's not even good enough to be called playing!" </i>Mariko
yelled, stomping on the canvas again.</p><p class="standard">	"Stop,
stop, stop! You horrid, horrid woman! Do me! Oh god <i>daaaahling</i>,
do me!" Yunoki rubbed her leg and stretched her other arm above
her head with a loud moan. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Let's
get the hell outta here!" shouted Yumiko. She grabbed Mariko and
Ai by the arm and pulled them along toward the door, leaving Yunoki
crying and moaning in the spotlight.</p><p class="standard">	Once
they were a good distance from the museum, Yumiko released the other
two and collapsed onto the grass. "We're away....we're away from
her...." she huffed.</p><p class="standard">	"I....could
use a drink," Ai panted. "Not alcoholic."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
was the only one who wasn't winded. She sat on the grass in the
moonlight resembling a stone lion outside a library. "I know a
good place for a drink," she said. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Mariko....are
you sobering up?" Ai asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Yep.
It's a bitch."</p><p class="standard">	</p><p class="standard">	Yehud's
Bar and Grill straddled the line between Midrash Terrace and Dubovy
Drive, a neighborhood informally called the Jew Belt, but was
patronized mostly by people from the latter. The owner, Nikolos
Aphroditi, had a long-running feud with Rahi Fetia, the owner of
Runa's Coffee Shop across the street. Yumiko liked both for different
reasons, but tonight Yehud's was the one she wanted.</p><p class="standard">	The
restaurant was well-lit and there was no space for dancing. It was a
resting place between more intense drinking holes. They served food
and soft drinks as well as liquor.</p><p class="standard">	The
girls sat at the bar and Yumiko ordered hamburgers and fries for
everyone, and a pitcher of coke, from the bartender, whose name was
actually Yehud. People often thought the restaurant was named for
him, but he'd come in and applied for the job well after the place
was built.</p><p class="standard">	"Hey,
Yumiko," said Mariko. "Remember that guy you dated who was
so into Harry Potter he jumped off a roof holding a broom 'cause he
thought he could fly?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah...."
Yumiko began to laugh. "Muggers attacked us and he was waving
around a stick yelling <i>Expelliarmus!" </i>
</p><p class="standard">	"And
he used to cast an 'Engorgement Charm' before sex!" Mariko
added.</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
was consumed. She doubled over with laughter and grasped her stomach.
"And....he gave me some....vomit-flavored jelly beans on our
first date!"</p><p class="standard">	"But
then you broke up with him—because he cheated on you with that
girl with the dentures!" 
</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
shifted from laughing to bawling without skipping a beat. She was
sobbing loudly with streams of tears running down her face. "And
after that I was such a mess I slept with Petey the Glue Eatey
Miller! God, god, I'm so pathetic! I haven't slept with anyone in two
years! Jesus Christ....I hate men. I can't stand them. All they do is
screw you and leave you. They're just freakin'....pieces of meat!
Just animals, dogs, monkeys with no control who talk you into bed and
make you think they care and dump you like a bad used car!"</p><p class="standard">	Ai
tapped on the bar. "Bartender. A pitcher of beer."</p><p class="standard">	The
bartender poured a pitcher and gave them three glasses. "Take it
outside, though. I don't want no one cutting up in here." He
jerked his thumb at the back door.</p><p class="standard">	Before
leaving, Ai paid with the twenty-five dollars from the man in the
train, and then she took the glasses, Mariko took the pitcher, and
together they brought the sobbing Yumiko into the alley. They sat
down on a row of broken crates next to the dumpster and force-fed
Yumiko a glass of beer. As soon as she'd choked it down she burst out
sobbing again.</p><p class="standard">	"You
have no idea how bad it is, how bad I want to sleep with someone,
anyone, even another girl—even you, Mariko. My best friend. But
somehow I can't do it. Freakin' men—those freakin' bastards who
made it nothing but a dream for me to even be a lesbian!" Yumiko
smashed the glass. "They're all rotten...."</p><p class="standard">	She
sighed and leaned back against the dumpster. Her hands fell limp at
her sides. Her left hand fell upon a rusty tin can and her right on
an old rubber ball. She picked them up and looked them over. She let
out another choked sob, then laughed. "It's stupid to laugh for
a rusty tin can and an old rubber ball, huh? And crying is just
useless."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
chugged a third of the beer straight from the pitcher. "C'mon,
Yumi. They've got a game going over here. I can hear the cards being
dealt."</p><p class="standard">	The
three girls left the alleyway and went into the bar whose dumpster
they'd been leaning against. It was a sports bar, filled with older
men and strippers in baseball uniforms. At one table a group was
playing Go Fish.</p><p class="standard">	"So
my comrades, here we are," said a bearded man in a Cossack hat.
He was shuffling the cards with obvious skill.</p><p class="standard">	"Just
deal, Ivan," snapped a man in a New York Mets cap. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
will deal all right—on your head!"</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
sat down at the table. "I'm in."</p><p class="standard">	Ivan
dealt the cards all around and smiled when he saw his hand. "I'm
in for ten dollars." The others all contributed until they came
to Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"I
match your ten, and raise you five."</p><p class="standard">	Ivan
chuckled. "You are never beating me, girlie! So I will be
starting the flogging with you! Have you any jacks?"</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
grinned. "Go fish."</p><p class="standard">	Ivan
swore.</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
tossed in another five and the rest of the table matched her.
"Ivan....got any threes?"</p><p class="standard">	"Go
fish," said Ivan.</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
approached a man smoking by the door. He was wearing a paint-stained
white jumpsuit with an Achaean Painting and Walls logo on the back.
"Hey. Could you give me one of those things?"</p><p class="standard">	"Sure,
babe. Come on outside and we'll have a smoke together," the man
replied. He was young, curly-haired, and handsome, but there was
something Ai didn't trust about him. She stood by the window,
watching Yumiko and the young man as he took her under a streetlamp
and lit a cigarette for her.</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
had smoked about half of her cigarette when the young man punched her
in the stomach and threw her down on the sidewalk. He bound her limbs
with bungee cords as a white van bearing the Achaean Painting and
Walls logo pulled up. The man jumped in the back with her and the van
drove off.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
went to the card table. "Mariko!" she hissed. "Two
guys just kidnapped Yumiko!"</p><p class="standard">	"What?"
Mariko was looking far more sober, if extremely tired. She had a cup
of coffee and only three cards left in her hand: a two, a six, and a
five.</p><p class="standard">	"Two
guys in a paint truck, they took Yumiko and they're headed for the
park!"</p><p class="standard">	"How—"</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
ask me how I know, we just have to go!"</p><p class="standard">	"There
aren't any trains running this late," said Mariko. "We'll
never make it."</p><p class="standard">	"Ivan
is having car," said Ivan. "Ivan can be driving strange
girls to park. And he is not even charging, for muscles pigtails girl
is card player worthy of Ivan's respect."</p><p class="standard">	"Right.
C'mon Ai, we're going with Ivan to the park."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
was still conscious, but her stomach felt like the time at age seven
when she'd eaten a three-week-old hamburger with toothpaste instead
of ketchup. She'd only just managed to keep herself from vomiting
twice. The bungee cords were wound so tight they were cutting blood
flow to her hands and feet, which probably wasn't helping.</p><p class="standard">	She
could hear the two asswipes who'd kidnapped her talking up front.
They both seemed to have bizarre lisps and fluttery, high voices.</p><p class="standard">	"Achilles,
darling....Now that we've found a girl with glasthez, the sthcavenger
hunt izth over and we can have crank again, right?" said the man
who'd punched her.</p><p class="standard">	"Patroclus
darling, we can have crack and crank and naughty thoughts, my little
anal sekth monkey," answered the driver.</p><p class="standard">	"Goody
goody gumdropth!" squealed Patroclus. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Now
Patrocluth darling, we muthn't do it yet. I'm driving darling!"</p><p class="standard">	"But
Achillezth darling...."</p><p class="standard">	<i>Crap,
</i>thought Yumiko. <i>I finally go clean and now I'm gonna be traded
for drugs by two lisping retards. </i>
</p><p class="standard">	Suddenly
another car crashed into the side of the van. Yumiko was thrown into
the opposite wall and landed painfully on her tailbone.<i> </i>"What
the hell kind of idiot—!"</p><p class="standard">	"It's
Ivan, Achillezth!" Patroclus cried.</p><p class="standard">	"Ivan?
What izth that naff Ruthkie doing? Did he vada us take her?"
Achilles cried.</p><p class="standard">	"That
meshigener omi won't rest until we're behind bars, my bijou cove,"
said Patroclus. "Scarper, my sithter, scarper to the park!"</p><p class="standard">	"Ready
your thews, my dolly omi, becauze here comes the tober!"
Achilles shouted. The van made a hard left and sent Yumiko face-first
into the other wall. Her glasses fell off and skittered to the back
of the van. 
</p><p class="standard">	The
other car rammed the van again, sending Yumiko sliding back the way
she'd come. This time she hit the side chest-first, and a jutting
metal band slammed her in the chest, knocking the wind out of her.
<i>Wish I had huge boobs like Mariko, that wouldn't have even hurt
her.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>The
van screeched to a stop, and Yumiko hoped the other car contained
people willing and able to rescue her.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	When
Ivan crashed into the van, Ai screamed. She couldn't help it.</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
kept her cool, although she was terrified too. Ivan had been
drinking, and he seemed to know and dislike the two men in the
Achaean Painting and Wall van.</p><p class="standard">	"Achilles!
Patroclus! You are going too far this time, kidnapping friend of
muscle pigtail girl who nearly as good at cards as Ivan!" he
bellowed. "Ivan will not let you get away with this!"</p><p class="standard">	The
van pulled left onto Killarney Lane, a four-lane thoroughfare that
led straight down to the park. Ivan took a hard left after them.
Mariko wouldn't have believed this greasy middle-aged card player had
the money to afford a red Lamborghini if she hadn't been riding in
it. She was glad, though; the car had more than enough power to keep
up with the Achaean Painting and Wall van.</p><p class="standard">	Ivan
pulled up next to the van and rammed them again, snapping the mirror
off his car. It seemed like a waste of a hundred grand to trash this
car, but Mariko didn't say anything.</p><p class="standard">	The
van burned tires down the road, but Ivan was barely putting on the
gas and his Lamborghini was keeping up. The van sped through the
park's Killarney Lane entrance at sixty miles per hour, braked, and
spun a hundred and eighty degrees. Tires screeched and burned, the
van bounced up and down on its shocks, and Ivan stopped on a dime
with a single gentle step on his brake pedal.</p><p class="standard">	Achilles
and Patroclus got out of the van and raced to the back. Patroclus
seized Yumiko and took off across the grass. Achilles came towards
the car.</p><p class="standard">	Ivan
opened the doors and Mariko jumped out and popped Achilles in the
nose, then hooked a vicious left to his middle and another right to
his temple. He went down like a cold buvare on a hot day. Mariko
leapt over him and ran after Patroclus. Unfortunately he was fast,
even carrying Yumiko, and he had a decent lead.</p><p class="standard">	<i>"Maybe
ya wanna bloody give up afore I rip ya bloody heart outta ya body
still-beating!" </i>she bellowed. It rang out in the crisp air
of approaching dawn.</p><p class="standard">	Patroclus
tripped over nothing; Yumiko flew out of his arms and rolled away. He
fell on his eek and got a screechful of dirt. Mariko jumped on his
back and jumped off, landing next to Yumiko.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
came up and together they took the bungee cords off Yumiko. She sat
up, groaning with discomfort and rubbing her wrist. "I can't see
a thing."</p><p class="standard">	"What
happened to your glasses?" asked Ai.</p><p class="standard">	"They're
in the truck. Get them, please."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
went and retrieved them. She stepped on Patroclus on the way by as
well—not just for revenge; it was also the best way to avoid
the patch of mud he'd fallen in.</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
put the glasses back on and blinked a few times. "Wow...."
she whispered. "Look!"</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
and Ai turned around. They were standing at the top of a hill that
looked all the way down into the basin, where the lake was. The sun
was rising; its nascent light glimmered through the glass tower of
the mall and shone in a thousand directions. Even the museum now
resembled a kindly chapel more than a threatening castle. Small blue
and brown birds were chirping in the trees, and the gondoliers were
all coming into port to change shifts.</p><p class="standard">	"It's
beautiful...." Ai breathed.</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
took off her glasses and stared at them for a moment. "I need
new glasses." She tossed them down the hill.</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
you're right," said Mariko. "Get some circular frames this
time."</p><p class="standard">	"I
need a new cell phone, too." She took out her phone and tossed
it down the hill. "I don't like this shirt, either." She
removed the shirt and tossed it down the hill. "Or these pants.
I've had this bra so long it's decomposing. God, these panties are
ugly. These boots are the only decent thing I'm wearing."</p><p class="standard">	</p><p class="standard">	Ai's
mother never came home that night. If she had returned around seven
the next morning, she would have found Ai and two other girls passed
out on the living room floor. One of the girls was wearing a white
jumpsuit with an Achaean Painting and Wall logo on the back. 
</p><p class="standard">	Ai
could never decide afterwards if she'd had fun that night or not. One
thing was sure: all three woke up with a bitch of a hangover.</p><p class="standard"><br />

        <p class="standard">	"Dude,
I don't know how much more I can take," said Allen.</p><p class="standard">	"Hmm,"
said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"All
we do is sit around making kissy-faces. She wanted to do that this
morning but I said my parents wanted me home. What kind of boyfriend
and girlfriend never get any action and just sit around watching
chick-flicks and cuddling?"</p><p class="standard">	"They
call them husbands and wives then."</p><p class="standard">	They
were relaxing in the courtyard at the mall after an afternoon of
smashing opponents in HIW: History's Incredible Warriors and watching
people go past. People with deformities, people with bad hygiene,
people with painted-on eyebrows. Two Jewish gang members, heads
shaved and sporting swastika tattoos, shot threatening looks at
someone with a Nazi dwarf-hammer tattoo. Two elves, a very rare
sight, passed by. They chattered in Mestaera, their voices high and
sing-song like they were on Novocaine.</p><p class="standard">	"Look
at her," Allen said suddenly. He was pointing to a tiny girl who
couldn't have been more than ten. 
</p><p class="standard">	"What
about her?" Yuji asked. 
</p><p class="standard">	"She's
cute."</p><p class="standard">	For
Allen to take notice of something 'cute' was out of character. He
never called girls he wanted to sleep with 'cute'; they were always
'hot' or 'salty', and he usually didn't take notice of kittens or
puppies or other things he would describe as 'cute.'</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
looked at her. She was about five feet tall, but so slim she gave the
impression of being much smaller. Her hair was chocolate-brown and
tousled; her eyes green, wide, and naive; and there was a splattering
of freckles across her nose. She was wearing a middy blouse, shorts
and white tennis shoes.</p><p class="standard">	"You're
looking at her a long time. I didn't know she was your type,"
said Allen, leering at him. "No wonder you never try to climb
Kilimanjaro or McKinley."</p><p class="standard">	"Ai's
close enough to making us pedophiles. And you're the one who pointed
her out," said Yuji. "You hoping she's one of these
nymphettes who pops mint-flavored chewable birth control pills?"</p><p class="standard">	They
watched the little girl be swept along by the crowd towards the
central pillar. "You gonna talk to her?" asked Allen.</p><p class="standard">	"Why
would I do that?"</p><p class="standard">	"Maybe
she's a nymphette, like you said."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
watched her board the elevator. "And maybe I don't want to be
Hylas."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	"Where's
Allen?" asked Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
rolled his eyes. "Making kissy-face with Jolie."</p><p class="standard">	"Is
Allen into that kind of thing? He always struck me as an all-business
type. Meet, screw, leave—the modern
way."</p><p class="standard">	"Jolie
makes him do it. They won't last much longer if she doesn't do him
soon. So the papers haven't published any of your exploits?"
asked Yuji</p><p class="standard">	"I
didn't take credit. I told the police we couldn't see who took Miba
down but whoever it was seemed male."</p><p class="standard">	"Who
knows the truth?"</p><p class="standard">	"Us,
Yumiko, and Ai. You gonna tell Allen?"</p><p class="standard">	"Are
you kidding? He doesn't even know I'm a nyvamna yet. He'd never shut
up. By the way, what's the deal with Yumiko? She came to my house
yesterday wearing the goofiest glasses I've ever seen and grudgingly
apologized to me."</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
last weekend me and Yumi and Ai all got drunk....I can't really
remember what happened, but I think Ai convinced her she'd been wrong
about you."</p><p class="standard">	"She's
been like, standing up for Ai at school all week too. I mean, I don't
think we'll ever be bosom buddies, but...."</p><p class="standard">	"I'd
like it if you two could get along," said Mariko seriously. "I
hate having to hang out with you separately."</p><p class="standard">	They
sat underneath the tree, enjoying the cool breeze and the shade.
Mariko began to eat coffee cake. She offered one to Yuji. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Look
over there," he said, and bit open the wrapper.</p><p class="standard">	"What....oh,
that little girl? What about her? Do you think she's hot?"
Mariko taunted.</p><p class="standard">	"I
saw her in the mall the other day."</p><p class="standard">	"Try
to pick her up?"</p><p class="standard">	"No,
but someone is."</p><p class="standard">	They
were too far away to hear anything, but it looked like a group of
both boys and girls were bullying the tiny girl. One of the boys
pushed her down.</p><p class="standard">	"What're
they doing here? It's after school," said Mariko. 	</p><p class="standard">	"We're
here."</p><p class="standard">	"We
have no life. Should we go help her?" 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
yawned. "What's the point?"</p><p class="standard">	"She's
badly outnumbered."</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
and if we go trash them, what will it prove? Except maybe who took
out Miba, if my powers get away from me."</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
we can't just do nothing. At least let's get a teacher."</p><p class="standard">	"They
won't help. They're too afraid of pissing off the Schlemiels or one
of the other gangs. They're useless."</p><p class="standard">	"Well
dammit, I can't just sit here! I'm gonna—"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
caught sight of who stood at the group's head. "No, just wait
here," he said. He stood up. "I'll handle this."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
wasn't about to just sit there, but she did want to see what Yuji
thought he was doing, so she followed him down to the basketball
courts. As they drew closer, she realized the group picking on the
small girl was mostly tenth graders. That seemed strange; why would
they even bother with her? Not even the ROTC made a habit of robbing
children.</p><p class="standard">	"Hey,
guys!" Yuji called. Mariko had had no idea he could sound so
jovial. "We sue, my yatsees saw!"</p><p class="standard">	"Who's
this tamie?" demanded a ragged eleventh grader who Mariko
thought was called Taz Richardson.</p><p class="standard">	"We
didn't yokaso him, Bonch," said a tenth grader named Lad
Bickerton.</p><p class="standard">	"My
yatsees, you don't need to dance a polka on a me-tie cheesy
shoe-joe," said Yuji. "You'd be over the nidgy to serve it.
Whatever she did, I'm sure it's nothing a few nommies wouldn't
nayosu. Ne?"</p><p class="standard">	"This
mini-coo W'ed us for nigh reason! Nigh only that, that enew Yumiko
Kanzaki's her annie. Nobody likes Kanzaki."</p><p class="standard">	Behind
their backs, Mariko had moved over to the tiny girl's side. "Yumiko
just hates jerks like you guys," she said. "And so do I."</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
butt in, Takahashi!" said Taz Richardson. "We know
Kanzaki's your tomo. I'm shabirring this yatsu. Your name?"</p><p class="standard">	"Watanabe,"
said Yuji. "He's right, Mariko, stay out. Ne, Richardson.
Nanny'd she serve?"</p><p class="standard">	"Do
you know what the hell they're saying?" Mariko muttered to the
tiny girl.</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
your friend just asked him what I did," the tiny girl replied.</p><p class="standard">	"She
worrowed at the way we shabby and tried to serve it mo!"</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
serving it mo. Nanny me?"</p><p class="standard">	"They
think I was trying to make fun of the way they talk," the girl
whispered. "But I wasn't!"</p><p class="standard">	"What
did Yuji say?" Mariko asked.</p><p class="standard">	"He
said he's talking like them too, and asked what about him."</p><p class="standard">	This
seemed to surprise Taz Richardson. "Nanny mo you?"</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
American. I summow here only a few nen. I shabby me-tie you yatsees."</p><p class="standard">	"You
want us dance a polka on you mo?"</p><p class="standard">	"Nigh.
I want you yammery on the cheesy shoe-joe. She's nigh served anything
waru."</p><p class="standard">	"Maybe
I dance a polka on you mo!"</p><p class="standard">	"You
can try, but I'm met'cha tuyo. So's Takahashi. Settle for gomen and
go."</p><p class="standard">	Taz
thought a moment. "I can nigh," he decided.</p><p class="standard">	"Your
friend said he's only lived here a few years, but he talks like them,
and that guy asked if he wanted to get beaten up," said the tiny
girl. "Your friend said to settle for an apology, because you
and he are both very strong."</p><p class="standard">	"Fine,
I'll serve you a mockery. Settle for gomen and leave, and I'll cocky
an AV doujin about any beshown you ski."</p><p class="standard">	"You
could serve that, Watanabe?"</p><p class="standard">	"Nigh
to boast, but my erou stuff's been in hones sold at SaComi. I'm even
interviewing for a job cockying stuff for aero-gi. Right I can serve
you any beshown you ski in doujin form saw."</p><p class="standard">	"That
quarries things." Taz turned to the small girl, who was standing
close beside Mariko, and switched to standard English. "Kanzaki's
sister, we're leaving you alone. Just apologize and we'll leave."</p><p class="standard">	The
tiny girl nodded. "Yes...." she whispered. "I'm
really, really sorry...."</p><p class="standard">	"Double-e,"
said Taz Richardson. He smiled and clapped Yuji on the shoulder.
"Watanabe, you're a yogie yatsu. Lemme coin you a nommy
sometime."</p><p class="standard">	"Shabby
me who to cocky and you'll have your doujin by rishu," said
Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	Taz
and his entire gang withdrew, leaving school grounds. As soon as they
were gone, Yuji turned to tell the small girl he and Mariko were
going and found her staring at him with huge sparkling eyes.</p><p class="standard">	"Commie's
com!" she exclaimed. "That was <i>sugoi!" </i>
</p><p class="standard">	"It
was nothing," said Yuji. "Um, are you all right?"</p><p class="standard">	<i>"Karada
ni daijoubu ga kokoro ni itai," </i>she said.</p><p class="standard">	"What?"</p><p class="standard">	"Reading
between the lines, mate, I'd say she likes you," said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	The
tiny girl nodded emphatically and blushed. 
</p><p class="standard">	Mariko's
watch began to beep. "Crap, I've gotta get home. My parents are
going out tonight and I've gotta watch my brother."</p><p class="standard">	"Wait,
neechan!" cried the tiny girl. "Um....You know my sister,
right?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah...."</p><p class="standard">	"I
need some help. I came here looking for her, but I can't find her.."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
would've liked to tell her parents Manfred would have to watch
himself today, but the truth was that babysitting detail was
something of a punishment for last week. She, Ai, and Yumiko had
agreed to keep the details of what had happened between themselves,
but her parents were angry she'd been out all night. Making her watch
Manfred was just about the only punishment they could give her, since
the TV only got two channels, there was never any junk food anyway,
and all her internet surfing took place at the library.</p><p class="standard">	"Sorry,
I can't. But Yuji here can help you, right Yuji?"</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
with Taz; I don't like Yumiko."</p><p class="standard">	"C'mon
man. She apologized, right?"</p><p class="standard">	"She
apologized for making a snap judgment. She never said anything about
being wrong."</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
this is a perfect chance to show her she was. Help a poor little
waif, huh?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
looked at the small girl, who gave her most endearing smile. He
sighed. "All right!"</p><p class="standard">	"Great.
See you both later." Mariko took off across the basketball
courts.</p><p class="standard">	For
a moment Yuji didn't say anything. He was doing his best not to look
at the nymphette girl beside him (she probably was if she was
Yumiko's sister. Their parents were probably a real piece of work).
Meanwhile the nymphette had moved closer than Yuji really wanted her.
She had on the same clothes as yesterday, but the collar of her shirt
had orange trim today instead of blue. The top of her head was
somewhere around Yuji's elbow. She was probably around Shoko's age,
but so short it was freakish.</p><p class="standard">	"What's
your name," he said at last, with no real desire to know.</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
Akari Kanzaki. Your name is Yuji Watanabe, right? That's pretty
common."</p><p class="standard">	"It's
not common at all in America. People made fun of me about it."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh
no, that's terrible!"</p><p class="standard">	"Not
really. It made me stronger."</p><p class="standard">	"It
<i>is </i>terrible. No one should ever make fun of another person's
name. Are you Japanese?"</p><p class="standard">	"Half,"
said Yuji. "And half Irish. Anyway, Akari, are you sure Yumiko's
not at home?"</p><p class="standard">	Akari
shook her head. "She's not. I was there just before I came here.
Do you speak any Japanese or Irish?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah.
So if she's not here or at home, she's probably at work. I can't see
her and Ai hanging out without Mariko."</p><p class="standard">	"Could
you tell me some Irish?"<br />	<i>"Ní dhéanfaidh."</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>"Does
that mean you will?"</p><p class="standard">	<i>"Ní
dhéanfaidh. Téigí." </i>He began to go.</p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>Akari
followed him. "Wait! Please tell me what that means!"</p><p class="standard">	"It
means be quiet."</p><p class="standard">	She
was, most of the way to the train station, and Yuji had an idea he'd
hurt her feelings. The fact was, finding out she was Yumiko's sister
was making him less and less glad he'd saved her. Taz Richardson and
his group weren't a gang, anyway. They could've been, but they were
mostly talk and had never beaten or robbed anyone Yuji knew of.
Mostly they were just a nuisance. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Look,
I'm sorry," he said at last. "Gomen. Your sister just
didn't make a very good first impression on me. Actually, she acted
like a psychopath."</p><p class="standard">	Yes,
that was it. Put out his true feelings. If Akari objected, she'd
leave on her own. However, to his surprise, she was looking
tentatively hopeful.  
</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
yes....She gets very angry when I talk about our father."</p><p class="standard">	"Are
your parents divorced?"</p><p class="standard">	Akari
nodded. "Dad's family was rich, and Mom got lots of money when
they split. She took Yumiko, and Dad took me, but he left me with
Grandpa when I was five. I don't remember him well."</p><p class="standard">	"Mine
too. Just about a month ago. They never told me why."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
sorry. Do you live with your mother?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
nodded. "Me and my sister both. Dad asked me to come with him,
but I decided not to. I still talk to him, though."</p><p class="standard">	"Do
you know why?"</p><p class="standard">	He
shrugged. "The usual reasons. Dad was gone a lot. Mom slept with
the pool boy. You know."</p><p class="standard">	"She
really did?"</p><p class="standard">	"No,
I was kidding."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
stopped at the vending machine outside the train station. He wanted
something to drink; his mouth was dry from the coffee cake. "You
want anything?" he asked Akari.</p><p class="standard">	"Anou...."</p><p class="standard">	"You
mean um."</p><p class="standard">	"Eh?"</p><p class="standard">	"Um.
That's what you say in English. I take it your grandfather either
lived in Japan or mostly spoke Japanese."</p><p class="standard">	"Un,
we lived in Japan. Um....may I have one of those?"</p><p class="standard">	"Buttermilk
soda?"</p><p class="standard">	"Oh
no!" Akari blushed again. "I....I can't read Eggo very
well. Gomen."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
got her the same thing he was having, a coke. "Then Taz wasn't
lying when he said you spoke Sakura slang."</p><p class="standard">	"No....but
I wasn't trying to make fun of him. I just wanted to speak Japanese
or Sakura slang with someone, like back home. I've never spoken so
much standard English, and everyone has short, ugly names like Chuck
and Bob. It makes me feel lonely."</p><p class="standard">	<i>God,
she </i>is <i>a nymphette, </i>thought Yuji. <i>She's damn good at
it. You'd never guess she's not really on the edge of tears. </i>Far
from softening him up, it made him want to get her to Yumiko as fast
as possible. She was someone else's problem. 
</p><p class="standard">	<i>Now
that's a bit cold. Nymphettes need to be loved too.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	Yeah,
and there're scores of guys ready to get hung on a statutory rape
charge. I'm nigh one of them.</i></p><p class="standard">	"Mr.
Watanabe, you offered to draw something for Taz, so are you a doujin
artist?"</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?
Yeah, I am. I wasn't lying, I did a few illustrations for the book
that Sakura College's manga club put out at SaComi last year. What
about it?"</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
I'm kind of a doujin artist too. Maybe we could draw together
sometime."</p><p class="standard">	"I
do 18-and-over stuff." 
</p><p class="standard">	"Me
too!"</p><p class="standard">	He
raised his eyebrow and handed her the coke, ignoring her last
comment. "C'mon, let's get on the train."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
had a monthly train pass, but Akari didn't, so he had to buy her a
ticket for five dollars. They also had the bad luck to be boarding
just as the after-work rush hour was beginning.</p><p class="standard">	The
two of them were crushed between a thousand warm bodies. Yuji nearly
lost sight of Akari twice. Somewhere around the stop for Yuji's
house, a three-hundred-pound man dragged his elephantine girth out
the door, freeing up a seat just large enough for Yuji and Akari to
squeeze into together. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Won't
you sit down, Mr. Watanabe?" Akari asked.</p><p class="standard">	"No
thanks, I'll keep standing." He didn't want to be knee-to-knee
with this probable nymphette.</p><p class="standard">	Instead,
a middle-aged man in a business suit squeezed in next to Akari.
"Hello there, little girl," he said.</p><p class="standard">	"Am....hello?"</p><p class="standard">	"Are
you coming home from school?"<br />	"No, I'm looking for my
sister...."</p><p class="standard">	"Are
you alone?"</p><p class="standard">	"No,
Mr. Watanabe...."</p><p class="standard">	"I
see." The man's wrinkled, shaggy claw went up the leg of Akari's
shorts and groped her smooth, hairless thigh. She cringed.</p><p class="standard">	"Hey,
noji," said Yuji. The old man looked up, his claw still fixed to
Akari's leg. "You might want to, ah, keep your hand to
yourself."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
I see how it is," said the old man. "What's your price,
then?"</p><p class="standard">	"My
price is you get up and leave right away or I punch you in the face.
I'm in a bad mood, so decide quickly."</p><p class="standard">	The
old man, stupid as he was, finally got it. He took his hand off
Akari's leg and scuttled off to another car. Yuji sat down next to
Akari and crossed his arms. 
</p><p class="standard">	"You
all right?" he muttered.</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
I'm fine...."</p><p class="standard">	After
seeing the old man run off, the other people on the bench had
discovered they had more room than they'd thought, so there was
enough room for Yuji to sit without being squished up to Akari. They
got off at the "Sakura Memorial Park - Southwest" station
near the lake.</p><p class="standard">	"I
really need to get home and do something about dinner," said
Yuji as they came to the gondola station. "But here's five
dollars to ride across. Go up to the center pillar to the very top.
That's Bistro La Pucelle, where Yumiko works."</p><p class="standard">	"You're
not coming with me?"</p><p class="standard">	"No,
I can't. I have to get home. My sister's probably there already
wanting food, and Mom won't be back until eight."</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
all right. Thank you so much. I hope I see you again, Mr. Watanabe.
And I'll be sure to tell my sister how you punched that pervert for
me." She smiled and waved goodbye. Yuji nodded and turned to
board another train going in the opposite direction.</p><p class="standard">	<i>We
have the worst location in the city, </i>he thought. That was only
true because Mariko and Ai lived in East Proastio Heights; other than
having to go across the city in the wrong direction to meet up with
them, it was a decent location. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
disembarked at the Sakuremeshi Street station and headed south three
blocks to his house. When he approached, he noticed there was a
strange car in the driveway. It was a tiny, powder-blue two-seater,
what Yuji thought of as a yuppie-mobile. Probably a German car, since
they put out more yuppie-mobiles than anyone in the world. Yuji
wondered if his father was visiting Shoko. His father's taste in cars
ran more to the classical—last Yuji
knew he'd been driving a '78 Mercedes Benz with a V8 in it—but
he could've traded it in for this thing.</p><p class="standard">	After
the incident last week, Yuji had called his father and asked if Mr.
Iphigenia was willing to give him another interview. Indeed he was,
his father said. The interview was scheduled for Saturday, two days
from now. His father had confirmed that Angel Strike made what he
called "adult entertainment programs" and wanted Yuji for
an artistry job, so Yuji had been gathering some things together into
a portfolio. When Yuji first started drawing manga shortly after
moving, his father hadn't been thrilled, but now he spoke highly of
Yuji's skill.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
ascended the concrete front steps to the top level. He checked the
mailbox. There was another letter from the law office asking for
their final payment. He wanted to toss it off the edge, but his
parents could incur credit trouble if the lawyers were never paid.
His father had handled the monetary end of things. He'd leave the
letter in his father's office mail when he went for his interview.</p><p class="standard">	He
unlocked the door, came inside, took off his shoes, and dumped his
backpack next to the door. "Shoko?" he called. "Shoko,
you here?" She was probably out with her friends. Yuji went into
the kitchen.</p><p class="standard">	The
kitchen and the living room had an adjoining wall, and from the end
of the kitchen it wasn't hard to hear things from the living room.
Right now Yuji heard someone laughing. A man. It didn't sound like
his father; his father had a short, deep laugh, but this sounded like
the giggle of someone addicted to snorting helium.</p><p class="standard">	The
thought that it was a burglar crossed Yuji's mind. He wasn't remotely
afraid of that, not as someone judged by INAO capable of fighting
five SWAT members at once, but he didn't think that was it.
Nevertheless he padded out of the kitchen and approached the living
room ready for a fight. He opened the door.</p><p class="standard">	Shoko
sat inside with a man about their father's age, though he looked much
worse for it. In fact he was almost a physical double of the man Yuji
had punched on the train for groping Akari: business suit, bald pate,
beady eyes, and hairy hands. He and Shoko were sitting knee-to-knee
on the sofa. It was no wonder Yuji had heard him laughing: the sofa
was against the wall that adjoined the kitchen. It didn't offer a
good view of the TV, so it was usually used for reading or napping,
but the end table had been moved in front and there was a bottle of
good vodka on it. Yuji's vodka. The pepper vodka he'd made himself,
his "crisis" vodka.</p><p class="standard">	The
shock of seeing his crisis vodka open on the end table distracted him
long enough that he didn't notice Shoko right away. When he did get
around to seeing her, he wasn't at all mollified. She was wearing a
middy blouse like Akari's, but cut much lower in the neck and with
red satin trim. Her skirt was about half the length of a mini; it was
more like a loincloth than any proper garment. The bald man's hand
was on Shoko's thigh about where the other bald man had had his on
Akari's, but the skirt was an inch shy of covering that area.</p><p class="standard">	"What
the hell is going on here?" he asked. The evenness of his voice
surprised him. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Good
afternoon, Yuji," said the man. "My name is—"</p><p class="standard">	"Shut
up," Yuji growled. Hearing his own name from a stranger enraged
rather than pacified him. "You're in my house. I don't know you.
I don't care what your name is."</p><p class="standard">	Suddenly
the man was sweating and trembling, and his hand left Shoko's thigh.
Whoever he was, he was a coward who'd probably never heard anything
so rude in his life. Tomorrow around the coffee maker Yuji would be
an eight-foot-tall professional wrestler wielding a switchblade
knife, but today this grown man was trembling like a naughty child
who's been caught with his hand in the cookie jar. At a scrawny
teenage boy. One he didn't know to be a nyvamna.</p><p class="standard">	Now
Yuji was actually starting to feel sorry for the old bastard.</p><p class="standard">	"I
want you out of here," he said. "Leave and don't come
back." 
</p><p class="standard">	The
man stood up and scurried off like a whipped dog. Shoko made an
irritated <i>hmph! </i>and pushed down her skirt. There were two
glasses on the end table, one empty and the other half-full. The
first thing Yuji did was take the empty glass and pour himself the
last of the vodka. Great. The old bastard was drunk, too. Yuji could
only hope he'd smash into a tree and off himself.</p><p class="standard">	He
set down the glass and regarded Shoko. He wasn't angry with her. Sad,
but not angry. That was someone else's job.</p><p class="standard">	"You
drank my vodka," he said finally.</p><p class="standard">	"I
didn't drink any of your stupid vodka! It was my—my
friend, Mr. Akusukebe. He'll pay for it."</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
he will. Through you. I never want to see him in here again."</p><p class="standard">	"We're
just friends!"</p><p class="standard">	"What
you do is none of my business."</p><p class="standard">	"We
didn't <i>do </i>anything!"</p><p class="standard">	"Just
keep him out."</p><p class="standard">	"You
don't own this house and you're not Mom!"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
turned around. "You're right," he said. "I'm not Mom.
But it was sloppy and dumb to bring him here, Shoko, because I could
just as well have been." His voice was rising; he hardly ever
yelled, but now he was angry. "I don't know if you did anything
or not, but either way I don't think you want Mom to know you're
doing <i>enjo kousai</i>, and if you don't want me to tell her you'll
keep your garricking lollies outta the hracking house!"</p><p class="standard">	"Loosen
up your ass and get stuffed," Shoko muttered.</p><p class="standard">	"Just
so long as you don't," he returned.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	"So
I said just so long as you don't, and left," Yuji burred. He
downed his third glass of vodka and offered the bottle to Ai. "You
want some?"</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
sure." She took the bottle from him but didn't pour herself a
glass. "But....I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm
meddling—shouldn't you tell your
mother?"</p><p class="standard">	"What
for?" Yuji shrugged. "What good would it do?"</p><p class="standard">	"But
you can't just let your sister do <i>enjo kousai</i>. Are you going
to do something yourself?"</p><p class="standard">	"What
can I do? Except beat the cac out of all the lollies and get tossed
in prison."</p><p class="standard">	"But
Yuji, she's only thirteen, it's illegal....you could get her patrons
arrested."</p><p class="standard">	"Whaddo
I care anyway? It's not like she's being forced into it. I tell you,
he ain't Humbert Humbert."</p><p class="standard">	"Who?"</p><p class="standard">	"Humbert
Humbert. Y'know, I like that about you."</p><p class="standard">	"What?"
Ai was blushing. 
</p><p class="standard">	"You
never step out of your little fantasy world and get real, not even
through books."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh."</p><p class="standard"> 	"Humbert
Humbert, the nymphette stalker, the original lolly! God, I knew I
shoulda talked to Mariko....except I can't....'cause she's watching
her brother....who's probably a shotacon."</p><p class="standard">	"I'd
like some coffee," said Ai. "Would you like some?"</p><p class="standard">	"Hracking
lollies everywhere, a plague of nymphettes on the hracking
place....What's a humbug to do? Humbert, I mean. Hracking Humbert,
king of the hracking lollies....And call me Hylas!"</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
going to make some coffee," said Ai. She put some water on to
boil. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
lied!" Yuji called into the kitchen. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Excuse
me?"<br />	"I lied. I do care."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh...."</p><p class="standard">	"You
should've realized a guy doesn't show up on your doorstep with a
bottle of vodka to rant about something he's fine with."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
sorry, I did realize that, but...."</p><p class="standard">	"S'okay."
Yuji tried to drain his vodka, found the glass was already empty, and
turned to the cup of tea he had ignored so far. "You don't gotta
gomen for everything. It's one of the reasons I don't like you. Wanna
know the rest? You don't, huh? I'm gonna tell you anyway."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
put coffee, cinnamon, and orange zest into the French press coffeepot
and poured boiling water over it. A delicious aroma wafted up. She
depressed the plunger and poured a cup for herself and another for
Yuji. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't like you 'cause you're too damn nice," said Yuji. "You
apologize for everything. You let people walk all over you. But I
like you. You're like a soft little bunny rabbit: so cute and nice
and all that a guy can't help but like you even when he doesn't."
He laughed. It sounded like Yumiko: short and bitter.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
placed a cup in front of him. "All right. Drink your coffee,
it's good."</p><p class="standard">	"See!
Put on a ruffled maid skirt and you'd be like Chamber Maid Mai Meido
Shicyauzo Gynematic Ipiretria! That's Chamber Maid Mai, Meido
Shicyauzo, and Gynematic Ipiretria all put together, see. Now do it.
Put on a maid skirt and say 'Onii-Master, I'm like gonna totally maid
you!' like Itokoi does."</p><p class="standard">	"Only
if you drink your coffee."</p><p class="standard">	"All
right, all right....Don't wanna offend imouto-maid, right? But I've
got it 'maid'! Get it? Made, maid?"</p><p class="standard">	"Please
drink your coffee...."</p><p class="standard">	"Sure,
sure...." Yuji began to gulp it down. "Ah. That's some good
cac. I'm sure you'll make a fine maid. You're hired."</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji...."</p><p class="standard">	"We've
got two nymphettes, an imo-maid. Yumiko would be the <i>tsundere</i>
of course—starts out hating me, starts
loving me—and Mariko'd be the childhood
friend. She ain't one, but she's real like, familiar, y'know? Man,
she'd understand this....all you're good for is the moralistic route,
and Allen'd say hire her...."</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji,
you care about this. Do something. You don't have to tell your
mother, but do something to convince Shoko that she's wrong to sell
herself like this...."</p><p class="standard">	"But
it's not. That's why I can't do anything, cause it's not. What good
is it staying clean in a stupid dirty world? Might as well make some
cash from it. Hell, I'm a pornographer. I draw pictures of nymphettes
all the time, so what should I care?"</p><p class="standard">	"That's
different. You're just drawing a picture. You're not buying an
underage girl's love!"</p><p class="standard">	"Love?
Yeah, cause love's a great wonderful beautiful amazing thing! That's
just it: there's no such thing as love. I know that, so I can't see
any logical reason why this should bother me so much."</p><p class="standard">	"Does
there have to be a reason?" Ai tried a weak smile. "You
care about her, Yuji. She's been through so much already, she doesn't
deserve to be misused by old men."</p><p class="standard">	"I
guess....how'd you know?"</p><p class="standard">	"Intuition."
Her weak smile grew into a larger one. "I have good intuition,
Yuji. I'm not telling you what I think; I'm telling you what I can
see you really want to do."</p><p class="standard">	"Heh...."
Yuji drained the rest of his coffee. Ai poured him another cup. "Nice
service, Annabel." He was drunk enough to drink his coffee a
little too fast without feeling the burn. "Listen, Annabel."</p><p class="standard">	"Er,
I'm Ai...."</p><p class="standard">	"Annabel,
Amniya, Ai....You're right, Annabel's dead and you're alive." He
stood up. "I'm not gonna do anything." He leaned in so
close their noses were almost touching. "'Cause it's all fine,
Annabel, s'long as <i>you </i>don't turn up a <i>enjo </i><i>kousai</i>-doing
furue roller-fooling met'cha menkoy-nuccarooing nymph-nymph-ette."
And he kissed her on the lips.</p><p class="standard">	It
wasn't long or particularly passionate—it
was more of a brotherly kiss—but it
tasted like cinnamon and orange, and felt pleasant like petting a
cute little bunny rabbit. When Yuji came up he was holding the bottle
of vodka and laughing. Ai had turned red as a stop sign and her eyes
were the size of saucers. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Well
seeya Annabel, thanks for the coffee and the sugar."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	"Anyway,
I'm off Manfred-detail today, so why don't we head to the arcade?"
Mariko suggested.</p><p class="standard">	"You
seen Ai?" Yuji asked. "I haven't seen her all day."</p><p class="standard">	"No.
Maybe she stayed home. The arcade?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
can't go. I had a bad hangover this morning and I've only just
recovered. I just want to go home and take a nap."</p><p class="standard">	"You
and Allen go drinking?"</p><p class="standard">	"No."
Yuji massaged his temple. "Are you kidding? He still hasn't made
it with Jolie, he can't leave the battlefield before he's taken the
capital."</p><p class="standard">	"Such
an apt metaphor."</p><p class="standard">	"I
was drinking with Ai. Actually, she wasn't drinking, just me. I had
half a bottle of vodka."</p><p class="standard">	"Half
a bottle of vodka gave you a hangover that bad?"</p><p class="standard">	"Lay
off, I don't drink that much."</p><p class="standard">	"In
that case, you were either happy about something or depressed about
something. And since you're never happy, that means you were
depressed."</p><p class="standard">	"Ha
ha."</p><p class="standard">	"What
were you depressed about?"</p><p class="standard">	"Sorry
Mariko, you missed the boat on that one. I wanted to talk to you, but
I couldn't, so I told Ai and now I'm fine."</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
be full of yourself. I'm not worried about you, just curious."</p><p class="standard">	"Expect
sympathy from you? The most caring girl in the world?" He
groaned and massaged his temple again. "Ah damn, there's no way
she's not doing something coggy, not in that bloody outfit….bloody
assisted dating." 
</p><p class="standard">	"The
money assists the girls in dating guys old enough to be their
grandfathers and not throwing up," said Mariko with a chuckle. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shrugged. Somehow that brought on another wave of pain in his head.
He massaged his forehead. "I think Ai is avoiding me."</p><p class="standard">	"Why
would she do that?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
embarrassed her. Myself, too. I had too much vodka."</p><p class="standard">	"I'd
love to see you after too much vodka."</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
you'll never get the chance. vodka isn't my drink anymore. I'm
switching to whiskey, like my grandfather."</p><p class="standard">	"Your
Irish grandpa?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah.
My Japanese relatives are all dead, I guess."</p><p class="standard">	"My
Australian relatives're the same. Whiskey's their drink and to hell
with Foster's. What'd you do to Ai?"</p><p class="standard">	"Insulted
her, berated her, then kissed her."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
slapped her knee with delight. "That's the best I've heard all
year! Yuji and Ai, sittin' in a tree—c'mon, sing it with me!
How'd you unclench your sour puss long enough to lock lips, anyway?"</p><p class="standard">	"Like
I said, the most caring girl in the world." Yuji sighed. 
</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
stopped laughing and tossed a rock down the hill onto the basketball
courts. "All kidding aside, Yuji, you really should consider
going to the police and trying to hang this guy on statutory rape
charges."</p><p class="standard">	"The
only way he'll be prosecuted is if they can actually find evidence he
slept with her," Yuji explained patiently. He'd gone through
this same routine with himself last night, and expected to several
more times, but this was the first time out loud. "The only way
for that to happen is for him to sleep with her and for me to know
about it. So to get evidence I have to let this hracking lolly
violate my sister, then let the cops swab her with a Q-tip and send
the evidence to the lab."</p><p class="standard">	"Maybe
that's better than letting this go on," said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"She
doesn't want my help, she wants money!"</p><p class="standard">	At
that moment Mariko's cellular phone rang. She answered it, and Yuji
tuned out her conversation and let his thoughts wander. Even if Shoko
and the old man had never actually been in bed, he was sure it wasn't
long in coming. He hated doing nothing, but going to the cops seemed
almost as bad. Threatening the old lolly was the one thing he
absolutely would not do. He couldn't.</p><p class="standard">	"Damn
it! Sorry, I can't go to the arcade."</p><p class="standard">	"When
did I say I was going?"</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
ignored him. "I've got to watch Manfred again. The little jerk's
eleven, he doesn't need me hanging around all the time to change his
diapers! I made plans with someone to come with us, but I can't even
stick around long enough to tell her I can't go. Can you tell her for
me?"</p><p class="standard">	"It's
not Yumiko, is it?"</p><p class="standard">	"No—oh,
good. Here she is now."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
had expected Ai. It wasn't. It was Yumiko's annoying nymphette
sister, trotting across the basketball courts and waving. Then she
tripped and fell on her face. Yuji sighed in exasperation. He
would've laughed if it wasn't such a nymphettic maneuver.</p><p class="standard">	Akari
got up. "Sorry I'm late, Marie-neechan!" 
</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
sorry too, Akari. I can't go."</p><p class="standard">	"What?"<br />	"I
have to watch my brother again. My parents are rekindling their
romance, or some crap."</p><p class="standard">	"Whaaat?!
But I wanna go to the arcade...."</p><p class="standard">	"Gomen,
gomen. Tell you what: why don't you go with Yuji?"</p><p class="standard">	"What?
Mr. Watanabe?" Akari looked at him hopefully. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't want to go." Yuji massaged the bridge of his nose. "My
head hurts and I'm in a bad mood. I just want to go home, take a
shower, and go to bed."</p><p class="standard">	"C'mon
man! She's new in these here parts. Show a girl a good time,"
Mariko urged.</p><p class="standard">	"You
talk more like a Texan than an Australian...."</p><p class="standard">	"Please,
Mr. Watanabe...."</p><p class="standard">	<i>Frickin'
frackin' hracking nymphette, </i>Yuji thought. <i>Frickin' frackin'
hracking Hylas. </i>"Fine, I'll go for a little while. Crap...."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
had raced off before he had any time to be mad at her. Akari was
standing closer to him than he really wanted. "Thank you so
much, Mr. Watanabe....To tell you the truth, I was hoping I'd run
into you today. You were so kind to me yesterday that I have
something for you. Um, my sister is coming to pick me up from the
arcade in two hours, and she'll have it with her."</p><p class="standard">	"Right,
okay. Well, was Mariko planning to take you to the mall or to Re di
Gioco?"</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
not sure...."</p><p class="standard">	"Fine.
Let's do Re di Gioco. It's closer."</p><p class="standard">	She
followed him to the arcade like a puppy, trailing behind and looking
left and right with wonder. They played HIW. He'd expected her to
take a separate machine, but she played alongside him as a tag
partner. Yuji's character was the immortal vampire form of John F.
Kennedy resurrected by aliens to take vengeance for his
assassination; Akari used Little Orphan ANNIE (Arbitrated Neural
Network Interface Edifice). Together they crushed everyone else on
the network. 
</p><p class="standard">	"They're
all out, Mr. Watanabe!" Akari said excitedly when they'd won.</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah.
You're a pretty decent player, Akari."</p><p class="standard">	Akari
was aglow with the praise. <i>So this is what having a real little
sister is like</i>, Yuji thought.<i> A little sister to have fun
with, a cute little sister who doesn't tell you to get stuffed and
hang out with derelicts. </i>
</p><p class="standard">	"Let's
play each other now!" 
</p><p class="standard">	Akari
had played well in the tournament, but Yuji was a good player and he
thought he could beat her. He used his usual character. <i>"Kuni
wa nanigoto suru n da to ienai ze!"</i> JFK asserted when he was
chosen. Akari switched to Meta-Siddartha Gautama, who responded with
<i>"Ommm."</i></p><p class="standard">	Yuji
scored the first few hits, but within ten seconds Akari had performed
a reversal and engulfed him in a hurricane of unavoidable attacks. He
finally managed to throw her off and use his Cuban Crisis Missile to
keep her at bay, then throw his Special Combo at her: Jack's Back
Knife Attack. No purist would ever use immortal vampire JFK because
of that attack, which most of them felt was too powerful for the game
to be fun, although otherwise he wasn't nearly as overpowered as Abe
Lincoln 009. But Yuji was on his last sliver of life and Jack's Back
Knife Attack was the only hope he had to beat Akari.</p><p class="standard">	Incredibly,
Akari dodged the attack and hit him as she went over, knocking him
out. 
</p><p class="standard">	"You
beat me," said Yuji. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Gomen,
Mr. Watanabe....Are you angry?"</p><p class="standard">	"No,
you're a good player. You beat me fairly."</p><p class="standard">	Akari's
face lit up. "Oh, no. I was just lucky, just lucky! Um, so I was
meaning to ask you, how old is your sister? Maybe she and I could get
together sometime."</p><p class="standard">	"No,
you don't want to do that."</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?"</p><p class="standard">	"Never
mind. Listen, do you want something to drink?"</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
okay....barley tea if they have it. Thank you, Mr. Watanabe."</p><p class="standard">	Just
as he was leaving, he heard Akari's cell phone ring. She answered it,
seeming concerned. Yuji went to the vending machine out front and
bought barley tea for Akari and coffee for himself. Maybe it would
help get rid of the last remnant of his hangover. When he returned,
Akari was just finishing her conversation.</p><p class="standard">	"All
right....see you later." She hung up. "That was my sister.
Um....she can't pick me up. She had to work. So when I'm done, I
guess I'll go over there and she can get dinner for us."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
gave her the barley tea. "Why does your sister work so much? You
guys don't seem to be lacking money."</p><p class="standard">	"Mom
has all the money. Oneechan doesn't like having to ask Mom for money
all the time, so she works."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
nodded his comprehension and cracked open his canned coffee. "I
guess your mom's not there much, huh? She must work a lot."</p><p class="standard">	"Um....Mom
got lots of money from Dad in the divorce, so she doesn't work. She's
out with men a lot, or sometimes at home with men."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
drained the can and massaged the back of his neck. His head still
hurt, and contrary to helping, the coffee was just making him edgy.
"Garricking enew," he muttered.</p><p class="standard">	"What?"</p><p class="standard">	"Nothing.
It's just—" He stopped himself before he could say <i>How
could any mother with a daughter like you be out running around with
men all the time? What kind of woman could leave a sweet little girl
like you to get in as much trouble as there is, not because of work,
but because there are a few brainless milf hunters in this city she
hasn't garricked? What sort of garricking hracking galla could do
that?! Why don't I straighten this bitch out?! Maybe she'll think
more clearly with her head</i><i>—</i><i>!!!</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	Stop
that.</i></p><p class="standard">	Yuji
had to stop before he worked himself into a froth. Otherwise he
really would beat Akari's mother—or Shoko's patron, or the
first person he saw who looked like either of them. Or Akari, for
being such a nymphette. Or himself, for being such a Hylas and
falling for her trap, even momentarily. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I'd
better get going. Thanks for taking me to the arcade, Mr. Watanabe. I
really had fun!"</p><p class="standard">	"Can
you find your way there alone?"</p><p class="standard">	"Sure.
I've got a real good memory."</p><p class="standard">	"Why
don't I come with you?"</p><p class="standard">	"No,
I couldn't impose. I'll be fine."</p><p class="standard">	"There
was a pervert on the train yesterday. What makes you think there
won't be today?"</p><p class="standard">	Akari
hesitated. "Well....I guess....But you don't need to worry, Mr.
Watanabe. I can do a little more than you might think."</p><p class="standard">	"It's
too dangerous. Your sister would claim kanly against me if anything
happened."</p><p class="standard">	Akari
giggled. "Better get your shield-belt in order, sharpen your
knife, and watch out for flip-darts."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
trained in the Weirding Way."</p><p class="standard">	"But
seriously, Mr. Watanabe, I'll be fine. Um, but if you really want to
come...."</p><p class="standard">	"I
do."</p><p class="standard">	They
left the arcade and went to the train station. The next train running
by the mall wasn't coming for another fifteen minutes, so they sat
down on a bench to wait.</p><p class="standard">	"Hey,
Akari."</p><p class="standard">	"What
is it, Mr. Watanabe?"</p><p class="standard">	"Would
you ever date someone for money?"</p><p class="standard">	She
seemed embarrassed by the question. "No….I couldn't do
that. I believe in true love only." 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
didn't believe that. Akari was slow to develop, but once she
discovered she could make money with no effort at all, she would
change her mind. It disappointed him. "My sister does it,"
he said. The train arrived and they boarded it.</p><p class="standard">	He
didn't speak to her through most of the train ride. He tried not to
think about anything either. It was all too much to think about. Once
he turned away from Akari and her possible nymphettic tendencies, he
was facing Shoko and her hracking lolly. Turn away from that, and all
he saw was himself drunkenly kissing Ai. Yes, the kiss had lacked any
passion or romance, so much that it wouldn't have been a big deal
even to him. If the victim had been anyone but Ai. He didn't know
what her history was like, but she was the type who overreacted to
embarrassment. It wasn't only the kiss, either—there
were all his thoughts about her, things he hadn't even vocalized to
himself, which he'd told her. Out loud. To her face.</p><p class="standard">	"Are
you coming in with me today, Mr. Watanabe?" Akari asked as he
made ready to pay the gondolier. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Yes."</p><p class="standard">	"Won't
your sister be at home?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shook his head. "I doubt it. I don't want to see her, anyway."</p><p class="standard">	"Mr.
Watanabe, even if she's doing enjou kousai, she's still a member of
your family—"</p><p class="standard">	"I
know, I just don't want to see her. I need to talk to your sister
about another problem." Yuji sighed. "God. I should never
have said that crap to you in the first place. You don't understand."</p><p class="standard">	"You're
right, Mr. Watanabe. There are a lot of things I don't understand.
But I am glad you told me....I'm glad you trusted me enough to
confide in me." Akari smiled. "I wish I had a niichan like
you."</p><p class="standard">	<i>They
should put that picture on the tourism brochure, </i>Yuji thought
unsmilingly. <i>With that caption. </i>
</p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>Friday
nights at the mall were topped only by Saturdays, but it was still
only about five o' clock, so it wasn't too crowded yet. Yuji and
Akari stepped into the elevator and ascended to the top floor of the
central pillar.</p><p class="standard">	Bistro
La Pucelle was practically empty. There were a few mendicants clad in
low-rise jeans sitting at the tables in the back and discussing the
government's energy cost reduction bill. The only other occupied
table was taken by Yumiko and a girl who might have been another
waitress. No, it wasn't....Only one person could have that red-golden
cap. It was Ai. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Oneechan!"
Akari called as she and Yuji approached. Yumiko and Ai looked up.
When they saw him, Ai blushed and Yumiko grimaced. 
</p><p class="standard">	"What're
you doing here? Looking for free dinner?" she snapped. She was
still wearing huge square glasses with yellow frames, more fitting to
an elderly man. 
</p><p class="standard">	"No.
I wanna talk to you about something."</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah?
Well, my break's over. I got no time to shabby with you. You did my
sister and me a favor, but that doesn't mean I like you."</p><p class="standard">	"Oneechan,
Mr. Watanabe really isn't—"</p><p class="standard">	"Quiet,
Akari. C'mon. I'll show you to the break room. You can stay there and
I'll bring some food."</p><p class="standard">	"Okay...."
Akari permitted herself to be led off by Yumiko. Side by side, Yuji
could see the family resemblance between them, though Akari would
probably be prettier when she grew up.</p><p class="standard">	"Um...."
Ai began. "I should go.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
sat down across from her. "No, stay. I'm glad you're here,
because I need to talk to you too."</p><p class="standard">	"No,
my mom—"</p><p class="standard">	"It'll
only take a minute. Listen, I was drunk."</p><p class="standard">	"I
know, but I really should be...."</p><p class="standard">	"Be
quiet and listen. Please. I made an ass of myself."</p><p class="standard">	"You
were only upset over your sister. It's understandable."</p><p class="standard">	"But
making my problems into yours is wrong. I needed to talk to someone,
but it was wrong of me to just show up drunk on your doorstep and
dump everything on you. So I apologize."</p><p class="standard">	"I....Don't
worry, it's okay. Really."</p><p class="standard">	"Good.
Now, about the things I said...."</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
don't worry, I understand. You were drunk."</p><p class="standard">	"No,
that's not all it was. Those were things I really thought about you,
but it was incredibly rude of me to say them." Yuji's voice had
assumed a grand, sober tone. "I hope you'll accept my apology,
and I want to remain friends."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
had absorbed herself in her water glass. "So....you really don't
like me? Then....why do you want to stay friends?"</p><p class="standard">	"It's
hard to explain." Yuji sighed. Now he wanted water. Yumiko had
left a glass. He finished it off. "There are things I don't like
about you, but there are other things I do like. In the end, I don't
know what to think of you, but I don't want to lose you. And the
kiss....well, it was nice. Apple-face."</p><p class="standard">	He
didn't know what had come over him to say something like that, but
she was apple-faced right now too, scarlet as a mature red delicious.
"Um....It was my first kiss."</p><p class="standard">	Somehow,
that made Yuji glad. "That's another thing I really meant: I'm
glad you've never done <i>enjo kousai</i>. Or anything like it."</p><p class="standard">	"I
sold a hair band to someone on the train when I was drunk," she
admitted. "He called it blue sailor."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
laughed. Soon Ai was laughing with him. It was a beautiful sound,
rolling and melodious, and that was how Yumiko and Akari found them
when they returned a moment later.</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
interrupted them by bursting into false, bitter laughter. "That
was a good one!" she squealed. "Now, if we can shut up for
a second, I need to talk to him. Alone."</p><p class="standard">	Akari
seemed to know what was going on, but Ai was puzzled. Yuji stood up,
feeling more like he was going to a battle than to a chat. That was
just the kind of feeling Yumiko created.</p><p class="standard">	He
followed Yumiko into the break room. It was a sparse room with a few
chairs and an old, cheap TV in the corner. There was also a snack
machine and a coffee machine, both blindingly expensive. Yuji
supposed every employer's goal was to reabsorb its employees' wages,
and it was harder for a restaurant than for a department store or a
corporation. Yumiko directed him to sit down and took the seat across
from him.</p><p class="standard">	"Akari's
been telling me," she said, "that you have a sister who's
doing <i>enjo </i><i>kousai</i>."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
right," said Yuji. She was probably going to blame him for it.
Corruption of the young. All men, and so on. He was surprised when
the next thing out of her mouth wasn't a harpy's shriek.</p><p class="standard">	"Actually
slept with anyone yet?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shook his head. "I don't know. She says no, but even if she's
not lying, I don't think it can be far off."</p><p class="standard">	"How
did you find out?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
basically tripped over them at my house. Drinking my vodka."</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
whistled. "Sloppy."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
what I told her."</p><p class="standard">	"You
drink vodka? I would've pegged you more as a Yoo-Hoo type. Maybe
Ovaltine. So, your child abuse is finally catching up to you."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
had been expecting this, and he didn't want to listen to it. "Yeah,
I violated her up and down and all around when we were kids and now
she's mentally damaged forever. Is that all you wanted me to know? If
so, I'll go."</p><p class="standard">	"Sit
down. Ai and Akari say you're all right, at least when you're not
drunk. I still think the only good man is a rubber one, but I'm
willing to help. For her sake, not yours."</p><p class="standard">	"Just
shut up and tell me what you're on about."</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
grinned. It was rare under any circumstances, extraordinary under
these. "You're not so bad for a man. I could almost believe
you're a woman."</p><p class="standard">	"God,
I hope not. It'd wreak havoc on my sexual identity. Would explain why
I don't like girls, though."</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
women don't drink vodka."</p><p class="standard">	"Neither
do I, anymore. I don't want the same drink as the bastard who's
violating my sister, so I'm switching to whiskey."</p><p class="standard">	"Really?
Me and Mariko drink whiskey. Maybe you are a woman."</p><p class="standard">	"Maybe
you're a man."</p><p class="standard">	"At
least it would make the guys who hired me gay."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
nodded. "Yeah....I figured it was something like that."</p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>"Now,
I just might be able to help."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
and Shoko faced one another across Yuji's kitchen table. Yuji himself
sat on Yumiko's left, and Ai and Akari sat on her right. 
</p><p class="standard">	The
clock ticked down to three. Ai rose and poured tea for everyone.
Yumiko added something from a boot flask. Yuji looked down and
realized she was wearing boots. Not the kind that would fit a flask,
though.</p><p class="standard">	"Stop
it," said Yumiko.</p><p class="standard">	"Stop
what?" asked Shoko. She tried for innocent indignity and rather
failed. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Stop
fooling yourself. This won't work for you. You think this guy loves
you? You think anyone is so enchanted by your beauty he'd pay for it?
Stop it."</p><p class="standard">	"Who
is this?" Shoko asked Yuji, now purely indignant.</p><p class="standard">	"A
tireless crusader for justice," said Yuji. "It stops,
Shoko."</p><p class="standard">	"What're
you talking about? I didn't <i>do </i>anything!"</p><p class="standard">	"Maybe
not, but it never stops," said Yumiko. "I know. For me it
only took a month to get past kissing and holding hands. Then they
didn't want me anymore, so I went to the pink salon."</p><p class="standard">	"Pink
salon? What's that?" Shoko demanded. 
</p><p class="standard">	Ai
blushed and stared at her teacup. "They've got this huge room,
kind of like an auditorium, with all these little cubicles,"
Yumiko said. 
</p><p class="standard">	"The
men go into the cubicle, and there's a hole in the wall where they
stick through their chinchi. On the other side of the wall there's a
girl who'll eight-foot him 'til he's ecoed. You never meeru him, ne?"</p><p class="standard">	"Then
it was off to the image club. Know what that is?"</p><p class="standard">	Shoko
shook her head. Yuji wondered if this would really make an impact on
her or if she was just shocked. 
</p><p class="standard">	"It's
a place where the girls dress up like nurses and maids and I don't
know, hracking giant robot pilots. I learned about it from a girl
who'd been fired. She tried to get a discount nosejob, and afterwards
she looked too creepy even for a giant robot suit to fix."</p><p class="standard">	"So
I went and got a job, and worked there for a while. Pay was lousy and
I had to tarrick noji with back, but I couldn't stop myself. I wasn't
moway enough for enjo kousai anymore and I couldn't give up the easy
money. Then finally I caught crabs from some tamie and it freaked me
out enough to get out."</p><p class="standard">	Shoko
laughed. "Nice job."</p><p class="standard">	"I
know. I was a hracking street whore. You will be too, if you keep it
up."</p><p class="standard">	She
shook her head. "No. I'm smarter. I won't let it happen."</p><p class="standard">	"You're
not smart!" Yumiko yelled. Ai jumped and Akari nearly spilled
her tea. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
waved Yumiko back. He would step in now. "Shoko, you wouldn't
even be here if you were really that smart. That guy must be rich
enough to book a hotel, but you brought him here anyway. How is that
smart?"</p><p class="standard">	"Shut
up! You don't even understand," Shoko snapped. "She's dumb,
but at least she understands."</p><p class="standard">	"Shoko,"
said Ai. It was the last place anyone expected aid to come from. "Um,
listen. I know you've been sick for the past few years." As she
spoke, the room's heated aura cooled. Her voice soothed Yumiko's
temper.</p><p class="standard">	"How
do you know that?" Shoko asked calmly.</p><p class="standard">	"Never
mind how I know. I know you just got well a year ago. You missed a
lot of school, and you're not sure if it'll come back and how many
years you might have. I know you just want to get out and experience
life. No one faults you for that, but you're wrong to think it isn't
your brother's business what you do. He cares about you."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
saw the guilt in Shoko's face. Instead of relenting, Ai pressed on
without mercy. "When he found you the other day, he was so sad
that he came to my house drunk."</p><p class="standard">	<i>Don't
tell everyone that you idiot! </i>Yuji thought. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
laid her arms on the table. Ai took hold of her left wrist, then did
likewise to Shoko. "Your brother cares about you," Ai
intoned softly. "It hurts him when you do <i>enjo kousai</i>....so
please, stop it...."</p><p class="standard">	One
second Yuji almost believed Shoko would obey. The next second she
pulled free of Ai's grasp, and the spell was broken.</p><p class="standard">	"Nice
try, Yuji," she spat at him. "I don't know what you're
trying to pull. Maybe some kinda weird good cop-bad cop. I'm leaving
now." 
</p><p class="standard">	"Shoko—!"
Yuji began, but she was gone before he could say anything.</p><p class="standard">	"She
doesn't know how lucky she is to have a good oniichan like you!"
Akari declared, her eyes narrowed and her lips poised with disgust.
He saw Yumiko had the same expression. It reminded Yuji of one of
those creepy pictures of identical twins who were wearing the same
clothes and standing in the same pose. 
</p><p class="standard">	"That
was unexpected," said Yumiko. "Stupid yewalkie woman.
She'll be dead before long. Ai almost made it, but she's just too
stupid."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
sorry, Yuji," said Ai. She seemed disappointed. "I was no
help either."</p><p class="standard">	"What
will you do, Mr. Watanabe?" Akari asked.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shrugged. "Dunno. Guess I'll finish off my crisis whiskey and
spend a peaceful Saturday morning sleeping in a pool of my own vomit.
Thanks for trying, you guys." He stood up. The second he
regained his feet, Akari's arms had encircled his chest. Yuji felt
moved and uneasy at once. He patted her awkwardly on the head. "Domo.
You nymphette." <i>And here's Hylas.</i></p><p class="standard"><br />

        <p class="standard">	Yuji was
zoning out in his room, watching some horrible comic on the TV and
starting on his second glass of whisky, when Allen barged in.</p><p class="standard">	"Hey.
Haven't you ever heard of knocking?"</p><p class="standard">	Allen
collapsed into the other chair and poured himself a glass of whisky
without asking. "I just dumped Jolie."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
raised an eyebrow. "My sister's doing <i>enjo kousai</i>."</p><p class="standard">	"Bunker
Hill and Breeds Hill informed me."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
raised an eyebrow. "Who?"</p><p class="standard">	"Those
Kanzaki girls. Y'know, the Fish-head and the Shrimp."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
yeah. They told you where I was?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
met them on my way here. With Kilimanjaro. Bunker Hill is psycho."</p><p class="standard">	"That
she is." Yuji finished the whisky in his glass and poured
himself another. "Why'd you come here?"</p><p class="standard">	"Every
liquor store owner in Midrash Terrace knows me, and none of them will
sell to me anymore. I heard you had a bottle of whisky. I wasn't
gonna let you finish it by yourself." Allen took a sip. "This
is good stuff! What brand is it?"</p><p class="standard">	"Sasana
Mhilis. It's an English brand, bottled in Ireland." Yuji sipped
down his own glass. "Cost me forty dollars."</p><p class="standard">	"Sweet
Adonai, my <i>froynt</i>, and accept my thanks." They clinked
glasses and downed what remained.</p><p class="standard">	Allen
considered his glass of whisky while Yuji stared at the TV.  "You're
no prude. Yuji. No control freak. You're practically Mr. Spock, So
why does this bother you so much?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shrugged. "I can't explain."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	The
bottle was gone. With two people to split it between, they weren't
really drunk. Yuji was tipsy enough to listen to Allen without
complaint.</p><p class="standard">	"So,
did you really dump Jolie?" he asked Allen idly. "Or'd she
dump <i>you</i>?"</p><p class="standard">	"No
lies, man. I dumped her. It's over."</p><p class="standard">	"She
wouldn't put out, huh?"</p><p class="standard">	"That's
not all. It's like...." Allen struggled to find the words. "I
was bored."</p><p class="standard">	<i>"You
</i>were bored? You were with a girl and you were bored? I can't
believe that!"</p><p class="standard">	"She's
so <i>dumb</i>, man! She expects me to treat her like a princess like
her daddy does!" Allen burst out. "D'ya know how
aggravating it is? We're supposed to go out to dinner, then she
realizes she's wearing high heels and they're hurting her feet. So
she wants me to carry her. Carry her ten blocks, Yuji. <i>Carry her
ten blocks! </i>She knew we were walking! Why did she not just wear
some comfortable shoes, change at the restaurant if it was real
important? She's got enough room in her freaking purse, that thing's
heavy as ten pounds of concrete and big enough to carry an enlisted
man and all his gear! And guess who gets to carry it when her
shoulder hurts?!"</p><p class="standard">	"So
I carry her. I mean, at this point I know she's an annoying <i>tsatskele
</i>and I'm just in it to lose my virginity, y'know. I'm doing my
best to stay calm 'cause I figure maybe we can get it over with
tonight and tomorrow I break up with her."</p><p class="standard">	"Anyway,
her family's frickin' rich but I always gotta pay for everything and
of course she orders the most expensive thing on the menu, freaking
lobster risotto, whatever the hell that is. I hadn't got two coins to
rub together so I had to use the credit card my dad gave me for an
emergency, so Mom'll be pissed at me 'cause she hates that thing. Had
to charge like two hundred some dollars on the damn thing. So after
that we leave the damned restaurant. We go to her place, and I think
'Good, maybe I'll finally get some'."</p><p class="standard">	"So
we get there right, and her parents aren't home like usual, they're
working late. So we go up to her room and she asks me to straighten
up while she gets some candles and wine. Her parents've got the best
wine cellar I ever saw. Anyway, they got a freakin' maid who comes
three times a week or so, so the place isn't too dirty, but I pick up
some books and stuff, y'know."</p><p class="standard">	"Now
her room is like the size of your living room, Yuji, and she's got
her own sofa and her own coffee table and her own home theater setup.
Her parents buy her crap 'cause they're never there. See what I mean?
Even her life story is outta some awful teen movie. Anyway she brings
up some wine and says, 'Allen, we're out of caviar. Be a dear and go
get some from Polanski's.' Which is on the freaking other side of
town y'know, 'cause she lives in Proastio Heights! But she like
squishes her body up against mine and grabs my butt with both hands
and says 'Please?', so I figure I really am gonna get some and I run
off to go do it. Y'know?"</p><p class="standard">	"Promise'a
sex can be a very powerful force," Yuji agreed. 
</p><p class="standard">	"You
know it! So I run all the way to Polanski's, get there just before
they close—the door was already closed, but the guy inside knew
me and he let me in—buy some freaking caviar, which again I
must charge on my credit card, all a hundred and fifty dollars of it,
and run back."</p><p class="standard">	Allen
paused a moment. On the TV, a comic was doing a bit about genocide.
"And <i>what's </i>the deal with genocide? You got all these
people running around killing each other because of their race,
whacking each other apart with machetes and stuff? I bet everybody's
hiding and when they get found they say 'Hey, I'm not Croatian! My
uncle's a Slovak!' Ha ha!"</p><p class="standard">	"Anyway,"
said Allen. Yuji picked up the remote and began to look for something
else to watch. He wasn't drunk enough to stand this drivel. "So
I go back to Jolie's. I think we're gonna eat some caviar, drink some
wine, get the mood just right and all—so I go back and at first
it's like I think, we're eatin' caviar, we're drinkin' wine, and she
says 'Why don't we watch <i>Runaway Bride</i>?' And Ah!, I think,
she's really playing hard-to-get eh? I'll bite! So we start watching
<i>Runaway Bride</i>, which by the way we've already watched together
five times and it's one of the worst movies ever."</p><p class="standard">	"Three
times I try to get close to her and put my arm around her shoulder.
The first time she throws me off and says 'Allen, it's a little warm
to be sitting so close.' So I think all right, the mood's not right
yet. So I try again, and again it's 'Allen, move over, it's too
warm.' Fine all right yeah, thinks I."</p><p class="standard">	"Thinks
I," Yuji repeated. "Am I your droog now?"</p><p class="standard">	"Shuddap
and lemme finish man! So anyway, I try a third time. I get the same
answer. Then the movie ends, and she says she's gonna slip into
something more comfortable, and she goes into this huge walk-in
closet which has these latticed wicker doors that you can see
through, a little bit. I thought she was teasing me so we could
finally get something goin'. So I take my shirt off. Luckily I got
all the preparations with me, my dad says never go on a date without
'em and I listen to my dad. Then she comes out and sees me and says,
'Oh, sorry, not tonight Allen, I'm tired.'"</p><p class="standard">	"You
can imagine I'm not too happy. Neither is my manhood. I was gonna
leave it, though, so I said good night, put my shirt on, and went to
leave. Halfway to the door, know what I tripped over?"</p><p class="standard">	"What?"
asked Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"A
pin. A brass lapel pin with a football and three <i>r's </i>on it.
And that wasn't it. There was also a pair of boxers that gave off a
distinct odor of, let's say, stuff that comes out of guys when
they're really happy."</p><p class="standard">	Those
pins had been given to the members of the school's football team.
Yuji didn't speak on Allen's graphic description.</p><p class="standard">	"So
I turn around and say 'Aha! No wonder you're tired when you've been
riding the whole freaking football team!' And can you believe what
she did next? She didn't even deny it! She's like, 'yeah, those
belong to Jaime Vasquez from the football team.'"</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
not the violent type, Yuji, but I came so close to jumping in her bed
and assaulting her. She knew it, too, 'cause she tried to goad me,
saying all this crap about noodles that'd never go al dente, how
<i>Himey, </i>as she pronounces it, is more of a man than I'll ever
be, et cetera. I was about to kill her, I really was. I mean, I'm not
much of a fighter, but I could still rip her apart, right?"</p><p class="standard">	"Probably,"
Yuji agreed.</p><p class="standard">	"What
saved me was that <i>Himey </i>crap. Suddenly I remembered all these
things she said. Like about real ragu that comes out of the Rag
region of Italy. Or how <i>Paree</i>, as she calls it, is currently
ruled by Napoleon and his wife Marie Antoinette. Or how she
pronounces <i>spaghetti Bolognese </i>like <i>spajetty ballognees </i>and
says that's the real Italian pronunciation and anyone who doesn't
know that is an idiot.<i> </i>I realized I'd forgotten what I already
knew, that Jolie's a shikseh tsatskele bitch who's not worth the
ten-dollar price tag on <i>Himey's </i>pin."</p><p class="standard">	"So
I told her so. 'You know what, I don't need you. I don't need to
carry you, I don't need to buy your lousy caviar, and <i>Runaway
Bride </i>makes me sick both as a Jew and as a heterosexual man. I
got a friend who does doujins and two good hands, and I'd take 'em
over a lousy ten-cent <i>kurva </i>like you any day. So you and <i>Himey
</i>can <i>kish m'in toukhes</i>.' And I left. Ain't seen her all
day."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji put
the TV on the Food Network. They listened to Emeril bam things and
for a moment he didn't answer. "That was very mature of you,
Allen," he said at last. "You are a modern man. A neurotic,
passive-aggressive train wreck. You will make a lot of money, but it
will never cover your expenses and the high point of your day will be
your appointment with your therapist. Every relationship will be
characterized by similar whiny attempts to satisfy your woman's every
whim. But it was very mature of you."</p><p class="standard">	"Thank
you, Yuji. Coming from a frigid pornographer who's dead inside, that
means a great deal," said Allen.</p><p class="standard">	"Thank
<i>you</i>. And I'm sure that you will very maturely never pursue any
sort of active vengeance against Jaime Vasquez. You will, however,
destroy his life if ever given the chance."</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
I will."</p><p class="standard">	Emeril
wrapped up his show with a kicked-up tarragon and lemon vinaigrette
and 'Iron Chef America' came on. In America, 'Iron Chef America' had
broadcast whenever, but in Sakura Memorial they scrupulously avoided
going head to head with the original 'Iron Chef', which broadcast on
Asahi Channel 5. Most Japanese preferred the original show, with most
Americans preferring the American version. Sakura natives tended
toward the original show. By putting them in non-competing slots, the
viewers were not split.</p><p class="standard">	"Labeesha
Dawn against Morimoto, the secret ingredient's gotta be purple
fingerling potatoes," said Allen. 
</p><p class="standard">	It was.
Labeesha, the first transgender contestant ever to be invited to
'Iron Chef America', made purple fingerling potato pizza, purple
fingerling potato ice cream, and purple fingerling potato burritos.
Morimoto responded with purple fingerling potato sushi and purple
fingerling potato yakiniku, as well as a unique purple fingerling
potato chowder in purple fingerling potato bread bowls. Labeesha won
by three points in the 'Presentation' category.</p><p class="standard">	"How'd
you discover Shoko was doing <i>enjo kousai</i>?" asked Allen.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shrugged. "You know. I barged in on her serving her patron my
vodka."</p><p class="standard">	"Is
that why you switched to whisky?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah."</p><p class="standard">	"Kilimanjaro
says Bunker Hill tried talking to her."</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah.
Yumiko did <i>enjo kousai</i>. She thought talking to Shoko about it
might help."</p><p class="standard">	"It
didn't."</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah."
Yuji nodded. "Yeah, it didn't."</p><p class="standard">	"What're
you gonna do?"</p><p class="standard">	He
shrugged again. "Dunno. Guess I could kill her." He
chuckled. "That'd end things right away."</p><p class="standard">	"Kill
her patron, more like."</p><p class="standard">	"That
wouldn't help, she wants to be a prostitute."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
a little harsh. I mean, <i>enjo kousai</i>—"</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
start with it, Allen."</p><p class="standard">	There was
silence for a moment, but for the noise of the TV. "She's been
ill for the last few years. I understand that," Yuji sighed.
"Then my parents divorced. They say the kids always blame
themselves, but I didn't have to. Anything I might've done to break
them up blew over years ago. So Shoko took the blame. They fought
about her all the time: Mom said Dad was never there for her, Dad
said he needed to work to support the family, Mom said <i>she </i>left
her job to take care of Shoko, so he could afford a little time off."</p><p class="standard">	"But
man, those cancer treatments are expensive," said Allen. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
know. Dad knew. Even Mom knew we couldn't afford them if Dad didn't
work as much as he did. I think that's part of why we moved
here—better health coverage. Shoko was already diagnosed in the
states, she wasn't covered, but if something happened to one of us
we'd be able to get by."</p><p class="standard">	"Didn't
your dad's company pay for it?"</p><p class="standard">	"A
little, but not enough. That's why he quit and started working for
Grantsoft. They wouldn't pay for it either, but his boss there was
understanding and offered him chances to get raises and promotions.
Mom waited until Shoko was stable to suggest a divorce. So coming
right off cancer, she gets to feel like she broke up our parents."</p><p class="standard">	"But
that doesn't make any sense! If your Mom's the one who suggested the
split, but she kept Shoko, how could it be her fault?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
laughed. "Feelings don't always make sense, Allen. It doesn't
make any sense that you felt horny enough to stay with Jolie for a
week and a half through all that crap, but you did."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
a low blow, man!" 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
know."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
glanced at the clock. It was almost nine. His mother should be home
soon. He didn't know what to tell her about Shoko. Something inside
him spoke against telling the truth. He wasn't sure his mother would
do anything even if he did; recently she'd been letting Shoko do
whatever the hell she wanted. "Maybe you better go. My mom'll be
back soon."</p><p class="standard">	"No
way man. I'm staying right here."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	Ai,
Akari, and Yumiko were walking in single-file, in that order, towards
the nearest train station. Ai and Akari were silent. Yumiko did
enough talking for both of them. She wouldn't stop rambling about
Shoko, and if the others tried to change the subject, she ignored
them.</p><p class="standard">	"I
hope Mr. Watanabe is okay," Akari said quietly.</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,"
Ai agreed.</p><p class="standard">	"Couldn't
we do anything for him?"</p><p class="standard">	Ai shook
her head. "We should just leave him alone."</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't think we've met properly," said Akari. "I'm Akari
Kanzaki."</p><p class="standard">	"My
name is Ai Maeda."</p><p class="standard">	"Are
you Japanese, then?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes.
I lived there until recently."</p><p class="standard">	<i>"Eeh....Nihongo
shaberu kashira?"</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	"Un,
shabiharu wa."</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	"Sakura
no Omoide no minna wa Nihongo shabenai wa yo. Maeda-san no Nihongo
shabete no wa atashi ureshiku naru wa yo!!!" </i>
</p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>"Um....Thank
you....I'm glad you're happy...."</p><p class="standard">	"No!
<i>'Arigatou....Dou itashimashite'</i> is what you say!"</p><p class="standard">	"But
I speak Kyoto-dialect."</p><p class="standard">	"What
the hell are you two talking about?" Yumiko demanded.</p><p class="standard">	"Oneechan,
Maeda-san is from Japan and she speaks Japanese!"</p><p class="standard">	"That's
great, Akari. Don't have an orgasm."</p><p class="standard">	"You
don't have to be so mean, Oneechan."</p><p class="standard">	"Stop
calling me that! For Christ's sake, Akari, we're not in Japan and
we're not in some anime!"</p><p class="standard">	"Yumiko,
er, I don't want to intrude, but is it really a big deal?"</p><p class="standard">	"Keep
out of this!" Yumiko snapped. "Go home, Akari. I have to
get to work."</p><p class="standard">	"No!
I'm sorry, Yumiko. I'll never call you that again. Just....just let
me come to work with you, okay? I'm hungry."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
you're hungry, huh? So you come running to me and start squawking
'I'm hungry Oneechan, gimme some frickin' food, I'm little and
adorable and lonely and I need some frickin' food!' Well, tough! Go
ask Mom if you're hungry, she'll feed you."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
sorry!"</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't wanna hear it! Here—" Yumiko reached into her pocket
and threw a handful of coins at Akari's feet. They came to a rest on
the concrete between the older sister's stylish leather boots and the
younger sister's white Oxfords. "Take my money and buy yourself
something. Just get out of my sight." She stalked off heatedly.</p><p class="standard">	Akari
knelt down and began to collect the money. There was a quarter, a
dime, and two pennies. Nowhere near enough for dinner. Ai could see
the corners of her eyes gleaming. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
listen," said Ai. "Um, I don't know if you want to, but if
you'd like, I could make dinner for you at my house…"</p><p class="standard">	Akari
glanced up in surprise. "Really? You'll really make dinner for
me?"</p><p class="standard">	Ai
nodded. "Yes. So don't be sad, Akari."</p><p class="standard">	Tears
began to leak from the corners of Akari's eyes. She jumped up and
threw her arms around Ai's chest and buried her face in Ai's
shoulder. "Thank you so much, Maeda-san!"</p><p class="standard">	"Er,
call me Ai please...." She was beginning to blush. Being hugged
was the last thing she'd expected. "It's really nothing...."</p><p class="standard">	"No,
you're really nice, Ai. This means so much to me!"</p><p class="standard">	"It's
really nothing. Actually, my mother is working late and I wouldn't
mind having some company."</p><p class="standard">	They made
their way slowly to the train station, neither one wanting to meet up
with Yumiko again. "Do you live with your dad too, or just your
mom?" Akari asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Only
my mother."</p><p class="standard">	"What
does she do?"</p><p class="standard">	"She's
a secretary. Actually, we found out that her boss is Yuji's father."</p><p class="standard">	"Wow!
That's a coincidence! So if you ever need to get her some time off,
you can just ask him!"</p><p class="standard">	Ai shook
her head. "Oh no, I couldn't. It wouldn't be fair."</p><p class="standard">	Akari
smiled a little. "You're such a nice person."</p><p class="standard">	Ai turned
red. "Um, so, what about you, Akari?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
live with my mom and Yumiko now, but until a little while ago I lived
with my grandfather in Japan. Until I came back, I'd never met
Yumiko."</p><p class="standard">	"What
does your Mom do?"</p><p class="standard">	"Er....she
got lots of money from Dad in the divorce, so she doesn't have to
work. She's out with men a lot, and sometimes she brings them home
with her. She gets mad at me if I'm around when she's with a man."</p><p class="standard"> 	Ai put a
tentative hand on Akari's shoulder. "It's all right. Um, any
time you're afraid to go home, just call me."</p><p class="standard">	Akari
hugged Ai again. "All right, I made up my mind. From this moment
on, I'm in love with you!"</p><p class="standard">	The red
rose up in Ai's cheeks, nearly as bright as when Yuji kissed her.
Akari pressed her cheek to Ai's to absorb some of the warmth.
"Y'know, I can tell how embarrassed you are by how much you
blush!"</p><p class="standard">	"R-really?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah!
Now, just now, that was a level four. <i>Yabai! </i>I was hoping to
make level five!"</p><p class="standard">	"R-really...."</p><p class="standard">	<i>"Zettai
zettai hontou ni zettai!"</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>They
took a train to Ai's house. Akari chattered the whole way. One moment
it was an anime called <i>Pani Poni Rush! </i>Next
it was her anime club in Japan. Then it was fighting games. Akari was
an accomplished fighting game player. She had won tournaments in
Japan. Ai admitted she was terrible at fighting games, and Akari
promised to teach her.</p><p class="standard">	When they
reached Ai's house, Akari followed her from room to room. She made
dinner while Akari sat nearby and talked about Grand Blue Comics' new
series <i>SisPuri Goes to NY</i>. She prattled about Oniichan and
Zibaala and Saragi and Mayaku until Ai had finished dinner. They sat
down to okonomiyaki and Akari talked about <i>The Melancholy of
Haruki Murakami </i>between bites.</p><p class="standard">	"Too
bad we haven't got a bath," said Akari. She was drinking
after-dinner tea in the living room. Ai had finished cleaning up and
come in to have some tea as well.</p><p class="standard">	"We
have got a bath. It's western-style," said Ai. "I know it's
not the same, but if you'd like to use it." 
</p><p class="standard">	"That
sounds pretty good," said Akari. "Will you take a bath with
me?"</p><p class="standard">	Ai shook
her head. "No! I-it's only big enough for one anyway."</p><p class="standard">	"Too
bad."</p><p class="standard">	"It's
the middle door on the left upstairs. Go on and I'll bring you some
towels."</p><p class="standard">	"Okay."</p><p class="standard">	She
planned to bring Akari towels, but first she wanted a cup of tea. It
was Yuji's favored genmaicha. Ai poured a cup and held it up to savor
the aroma. The sesame smelled nutty and rich. She took a sip and
relished it a moment before she swallowed. No doubt Akari would
squeal if she knew Ai had taken tea ceremony classes. She wasn't
graceful enough for it, but the class had raised her appreciation of
tea.</p><p class="standard">	She
finished one cup and brought up two towels and a set of her own
pajamas to the bathroom. The open door released Akari's voice
chanting some anime song about love and dreams. She was an
unpracticed singer, but very energetic. "Akari, I'm leaving
these on the counter, okay? Please stay on the mat when you come to
get them."</p><p class="standard">	"Roger,
Ren-chan!"</p><p class="standard">	Ai read
<i>Mestaera: The Idiot's Guide</i> in the living room until Akari
came down. She had changed into the pajamas and wrapped her hair in a
towel.  "Your turn, Ren-chan!"</p><p class="standard">	"That's
all right, I think I'll bathe in the morning."</p><p class="standard">	"No!
You have to take a bath now, Ren-chan."</p><p class="standard">	"Akari,
um, why are you calling me Ren-chan?"</p><p class="standard">	"Ai
equals love <i>koi </i>equals love <i>koi </i>equals <i>ren</i>—it's
all in the kanji," said Akari.</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
I see. But can't you just call me by my name?"</p><p class="standard">	"No."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
waited for her to explain. "Why not?" she asked when Akari
didn't.</p><p class="standard">	"It's
not enough. You're the person I love, so I can't call you what
everyone else does."</p><p class="standard">	"Can
you please stop that?"</p><p class="standard">	"What?"</p><p class="standard">	"All
this 'person you love' stuff."</p><p class="standard">	"But
it's true!"</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
um, maybe there are times when the truth is something we shouldn't
tell."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
just silly. Don't worry if you don't feel it. It's my job to make you
love me as much as I love you."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
coughed and poured herself a cup of tea. She hardly tasted it. It was
gone before she knew it. She poured herself another. She'd gone over
this information on Mestaera modal suffixes five or six times, but
the information wouldn't break through her brain. 
</p><p class="standard">	Akari
was playing her Kutenbi Hueguela. She narrated everything that
happened. "Ah darn, I missed that Pegasus Rider. I better send
Walt. Yes! A critical hit. C'mon, Alwood, strike back with your Iron
Blade!"</p><p class="standard">	Ai
gave up on the modal suffixes. "Um, what game are you playing?"</p><p class="standard">	"It's
called <i>Crest of Mindalina: Rekka no Tsurugi</i>. It's <i>kakkoi!</i>
Have you ever played it?"</p><p class="standard">	"No...."</p><p class="standard">	"You've
got to try it." Akari forced the handheld game on Ai and tutored
her from over the chair's shoulder. "Let Lucifa handle him. Rin
can't do it. Watch out, reinforcements! Fex and Sarah should take
care of them. Let Essex and Main kill those guys."</p><p class="standard">	"You're
not bad at this," said Ai. 
</p><p class="standard">	"It's
nothing."</p><p class="standard">	That
was the only time that evening Akari didn't answer with some rant. Ai
played for a while longer, but she could tell Akari was getting
sleepy. She suggested bedtime.</p><p class="standard">	"All
right. Where're we sleeping, Ren-chan?"</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
I thought you could sleep on the sofa."</p><p class="standard">	"No!
That's no good." 
</p><p class="standard">	"Why
not?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
want to be near Ren-chan while I sleep."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
shook her head. "No, I'm sorry. Would you like the bed?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
like wherever Ren-chan is."</p><p class="standard">	She
shook her head again. "I can't sleep like that."</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
all right. I'll take the sofa. I guess I'm not ready for Ren-chan
just yet."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
was glad she had agreed without arguing too much. She brought Akari a
blanket and two pillows, and bade her good night. After Akari was in
bed, Ai took a shower upstairs. She changed into pajamas and sat down
in her room to read a few manga. Reading a dense book before bed was
like eating a heavy meal; it caused strange dreams and thoughts, and
Ai tended to wake up with a headache. She never read anything heavier
than Stephen King. Five chapters of <i>The Place From Our Early Times</i>
behind her, she turned off the desk lamp, crossed the cream-colored
carpet, and climbed into the queen-sized bed. 
</p><p class="standard">	The
bed had always seemed huge to her. Lying in it was like swimming in a
lake of white comforters and pink sheets. Her brother had budgeted
the decor for her room. He had chosen each piece and had it bought
and moved in before she or her mother had arrived. In Japan, Ai's
room had been the size of a broom closet and her single bed took up
half the floor. Here, the mammoth queen bed fit into one small
corner.</p><p class="standard">	She
drifted off thinking about her brother. She remembered his thick
hair, the same color as hers; his mirror-like auburn eyes; and his
wiry frame, powerful as a cougar. He was her constant companion. She
and he were the only siblings who had inherited Mother's hair. It was
an outward sign of an inward truth.</p><p class="standard">	His
features were morphing. His red-golden hair became almond brown, and
his auburn eyes green. Instead of his uniform, he had on a plain
dress shirt and pants. It was—</p><p class="standard">	Ai
was asleep before she knew it. Even in sleep, she blushed.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	
"Ren-chan! Ren-chan! Ai!" Akari was shaking her.</p><p class="standard">	She
tried to sit up, but Akari was straddling her torso. "Get off
me!" she cried. "Akari!"</p><p class="standard">	Akari
hopped to her feet. Ai sat up. "What's going on?"</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
I kind of melted your coffeepot." Akari laughed nervously.</p><p class="standard">	"How
did you accomplish that?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
was trying to make coffee, and—"</p><p class="standard">	"Wait,
are you talking about the French press, or the coffeemaker?"</p><p class="standard">	"The
coffeemaker."</p><p class="standard">	"Okay.
What did you do to it?"<br />	"Well, I put it on the stove
and—"</p><p class="standard">	"Stop.
I don't need to hear it." Ai got out of bed and crossed the room
to her dresser. "Please tell me it's not fused to the burner."</p><p class="standard">	"No,
it didn't really melt. It actually kind of shattered. I picked up all
the pieces."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
began to dig through the dresser. "Would you go outside while
I'm changing, Akari?"</p><p class="standard">	"Sure.
I'm not ready to violate Ren-chan's creamy body just yet."</p><p class="standard">	Her blush
deepened. "Would you please stop talking about me like that?! I
don't swing that way!"</p><p class="standard">	"I
got a level four out of Ren-chan!"</p><p class="standard">	She
sighed. "It's no wonder Yumiko gets angry with you."</p><p class="standard">	"Ren-chan's
nothing like that woman. She's nice, and kind, and sweet."</p><p class="standard">	<i>And
gutless, and overly tolerant, </i>Ai added mentally. "She's just
overwrought."</p><p class="standard">	"She
doesn't have to take it out on me!" Akari insisted.</p><p class="standard">	Privately,
Ai agreed with her. Nothing about their situation was Akari's fault.
But she also understood Yumiko's feelings. It couldn't be easy
working a waitress job after school and on weekends and having no
home to go back to half the time. Nevertheless, Akari couldn't stay
with her much longer. She wouldn't make it. She needed to ask
someone's advice. 
</p><p class="standard">	It
would be best to talk to Yumiko, of course, but after last night, Ai
was wary of her. Mariko could help, but Ai knew whose advice she
really wanted to ask. It had to be Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	She
finished dressing and checked herself in the mirror. No, this outfit
was too formal. If she was meeting Yuji, she needed something casual;
he hated formality. She changed into a white pinafore dress and
leggings. Then she thought about the weather, and put on a button-up
sweater too.</p><p class="standard">	"Wow,
Ren-chan!" said Akari. "All this just for our date?"</p><p class="standard">	Ai
blushed. "It's not a date! Stop calling it that! And no, it's
not. I need to talk to Yuji."</p><p class="standard">	"Ooh,
you're gonna see Mr. Watanabe! Can I come?"</p><p class="standard">	"Sorry,
no."</p><p class="standard">	"But
why not?"</p><p class="standard">	"It's
a...." Ai stopped before saying 'private matter'. That would
just make Akari curious. "It's about schoolwork. So it's
boring."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
yeah."</p><p class="standard">	"So
stay here and play video games, okay? Or you can read my manga if you
like."</p><p class="standard">	"All
right," Akari agreed. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I'll
make breakfast before I leave, okay?" 
</p><p class="standard">	"If
it's as good as dinner last night, I'm happy," said Akari.</p><p class="standard">	She
decided to call first. Showing up at someone’s house out of the
blue could be very uncomfortable, and Yuji would make it worse. He
always did.</p><p class="standard">	Ai had
never owned a cell phone. Her mother had one, now that she was
working, but at the house they used an old office-style telephone
that sat on an end table at the bottom of the staircase. There was
nowhere to sit nearby and the cord wasn't long enough to sit on the
floor. 
</p><p class="standard">	The thing
had never made a call.</p><p class="standard">	She could
ask Akari for her cell phone. No, she would use the hall phone, but
keep the call short. She hoped someone was awake at Yuji's house this
early. If he’d been up all night drinking he wouldn’t be,
and his sister had probably been out doing compensated dating, but
maybe their mother was awake.</p><p class="standard">	She put
water on to boil for more coffee and went into the hall. She had
already picked up the phone when she realized she didn't know his
number.</p><p class="standard">	<i>Stupid!
</i>she cursed herself. <i>Stupid stupid stupid dumb! How could it
take you that long to realize you don't have his number?</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>She
did have Mariko's, though. Ai dialed Mariko's cell phone and hoped
she was awake. She didn't seem like an early riser type. Ai waited
while the phone rang once, twice, thrice. On the tenth ring, Mariko
answered. "Hello?" She sounded groggy.</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
Mariko....it's Ai. Sorry to wake you."</p><p class="standard">	"What're
you talking about? I wasn't asleep."</p><p class="standard">	"Um...."</p><p class="standard">	"Kidding.
Don't worry about it. What's up?"</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
I needed to talk to Yuji and I wondered if you had his number."</p><p class="standard">	"I've
got his home number. He hates cell phones."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
gave Ai the number and Ai let her go. She dialed Yuji and waited. It
rang so long that Ai didn't think anyone was going to answer, but
someone finally did. "Yello, Watanabe residence."</p><p class="standard">	"Hello?
Um, can I speak with Yuji?"</p><p class="standard">	"Kiliman—I
mean, Ai?"</p><p class="standard">	"Oh...."
At first Ai hadn't recognized the voice. Now she knew it was Allen.</p><p class="standard">	"That
jerk! Two-timing McKinley! Can't he at least leave something for me?"</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
Allen, can I please speak to Yuji?"</p><p class="standard">	"Just
got done with the relationship from hell and—"</p><p class="standard">	"Allen?"
she interrupted. "Can I please speak to Yuji?"</p><p class="standard">	"Fine,
fine. I'll wake Don Juan for you." 
</p><p class="standard">	A moment
later, she was on the phone with Yuji. "Hey."</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji!
Hi. Um, I needed to talk to you. Um, it's a nice day, isn't it? Not
too hot, not too cold. The lake is probably nice. Maybe Akari wants
to go swimming. Um—"</p><p class="standard">	"Did
you have a specific topic in mind, or did you just need to get that
off your chest?" Yuji grumbled. He sounded worse than a
half-bottle of whisky hangover.</p><p class="standard">	"Sorry,
I was rambling. What I really wanted to talk about was Akari."</p><p class="standard">	"The
nymphette? What about her?"</p><p class="standard">	"She's
at my house. Can you please meet me? I'd rather not talk about it on
the phone."</p><p class="standard">	There was
silence on the other end for a moment. "Give me an hour. Then
I'll talk to you. On one condition. You have to buy me breakfast in
Totenkroits Square." 
</p><p class="standard">	"All
right," Ai agreed.</p><p class="standard">	"Meet
me at the Ataraxia Lane train station. Bring your credit card if you
have one." He hung up.</p><p class="standard">	Ai went
upstairs and grabbed her purse. She didn't have any credit cards, nor
much cash, so she would have to stop by the bank and withdraw some.
There was a bank in Westenra Shopping Center near the edge of town,
and a train station near there. 
</p><p class="standard">	As
she walked to the shopping center, she looked up at the sky. It was a
clear day, with a few lazy cumulus floating by. Ai thought how pretty
it would be if the clouds were pink. She stared at them for a few
minutes, imagining it until they almost <i>were </i>pink. 
</p><p class="standard">	The
shopping center’s clock said it was still 6:00. <i>It must be
malfunctioning, </i>Ai thought. Bus number six pulled up and let off
a group of unfortunates who worked on Saturday. 
</p><p class="standard">	She
had thought she was on her last dollar, but there were still five
hundred in the account. She withdrew two hundred and wished Yuji had
chosen somewhere economical to eat.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	Totenkroits
Square was located in the park not far from Yuji's house. It was one
of the few commercial sites that had gotten approval from the city
council to be in the park. 
</p><p class="standard">	It was
actually a large plaza with three separate squares organized in a
triangular shape. The entire area was built the mimic the geography
of southern central Europe—in the northern square were German,
Swiss, and Belgian restaurants, in the western square were French
restaurants, and the eastern square held Italian restaurants.</p><p class="standard">	"They
started out really inexpensive, from what I hear," Yuji was
saying as the two of them rounded the fountain. An old-style
crossroads sign indicated that Piazza Italiana was back and to their
right, and Place du France was on the left. They were heading toward
Deutsche Square. "But when tourists started coming to the park
from other parts of the island, the owners all realized they could
gouge the crap out of people, so they formed a sort of European
restaurant monopoly. Only the Jewish places in Midrash Terrace aren't
in on it."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
interesting," Ai commented. She wished she had something more
remarkable to say. Or at least more enthusiasm in her voice. She
glanced at her watch, an old brass analogue with a leather band. It
claimed the time was 6:09. 
</p><p class="standard">	Deutsche
Square was surprisingly tasteful: there weren't any yodeling men in
lederhosen or female Olympic bodybuilders in sight. All the
restaurants had tables on the sidewalk. People would queue up outside
at other times, but it was too early for that now.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji led
the way into Labyrinthus Obscuri. It was one of the larger cafés.
Ai had never been to Germany, but the mahogany furniture reminded her
of a few neighborhood pubs in England. There was no smoking area in
here, though. Two rooms lit by rows of mural windows buzzed with
waitresses serving the few customers. They were seated in the second
room and provided with menus by a waitress who was also not wearing
lederhosen, nor was she an Olympic bodybuilder. They started with
coffee and fresh strudel.</p><p class="standard">	"So,"
said Yuji. "What do you want to talk about."</p><p class="standard">	She
sighed. "It's Akari." 
</p><p class="standard">	She told
him about the incident last night. She told him what Akari had told
her. While she did, Yuji bit into the strudel. It was just out of the
oven, with the flakiest crust she'd ever tasted, and warm apples and
cinnamon inside. The expression on his face was probably the closest
she'd ever seen him come to a real smile. Ai had to admire his
self-control.</p><p class="standard">	"What
do you want me to do about it? They're deranged. Just let them fight
and don't get involved."</p><p class="standard">	"I
could do that," said Ai. "But you didn't see it, Yuji. She
was really crying. She must have felt so helpless."</p><p class="standard">	"How
d'you know how she must have felt?"</p><p class="standard">	"I've
been helpless a lot. I know it when I see it." An idea struck
her. "Such as when you kissed me, and I couldn't stop you."</p><p class="standard">	Again,
he didn't come close to any sort of reaction. Again, Ai had to admire
his self-control. She thought he really was embarrassed, though. He
just hid it well. Her own control wasn't so good; she could feel her
cheeks lighting up. "Um, sorry. I shouldn't have mentioned that,
but I really do want to help Akari. I just can't keep her with me
forever."</p><p class="standard">	"So
you want me to take her?" Yuji asked.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
shook her head. "No, I wouldn't ask that of you. I just want
your advice. I think you're the wisest of us, Yuji."</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,"
he scoffed. "In a mythic exchange with the gods, I traded girls
for superpowers and wisdom."</p><p class="standard">	"That
wasn't what I—"</p><p class="standard">	"By
the way, have you noticed how dead this place is?"</p><p class="standard">	Ai
looked around. There wasn't a single occupied table. The ones outside
were empty as well. "It's really early, so."</p><p class="standard">	"It's
not just really early. There isn't even a waitress around. The one
who served us is gone. There's no one at the register either."</p><p class="standard">	The
restaurant sold coffee beans and baked goods in the other room. The
register was in there. Ai had to crane her neck to see Yuji was
right. There wasn't a soul in the entire café. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Maybe
he just went to the bathroom," she suggested, but the emptiness
gave her a bad feeling. She saw Yuji shared it.</p><p class="standard">	"Let's
leave."</p><p class="standard">	"But
we haven't—"</p><p class="standard">	"Leave
the money on your way out. Only let's go."</p><p class="standard">	But
when Ai tried to open the door, the knob wouldn't turn. Then she
noticed the plaza was empty too.</p><p class="standard">	"What
the hell's going on?" Yuji demanded.</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji.
It's been a long time."</p><p class="standard">	The
speaker was a girl with green eyes, skin that was brown like caffè
latte, and sleek raven-black hair that caught the light around the
crown of her head, creating a halo-like sheen. She was Ai's height,
and her stride was long and graceful as she left the kitchen and
circled the glass case of baked items. And she was holding a pie.</p><p class="standard">	When
Yuji saw her, his knees buckled. He fell into a chair and stared at
her. "A-Amniya? Is that you?"</p><p class="standard">	The
girl nodded. "Yes. It's me, Yuji. Can I sit down? I've brought
pie."</p><p class="standard">	"Just
like when we first met," Yuji mumbled. He seemed to have
forgotten Ai was there. "How can this be happening?"</p><p class="standard">	"I've
decided to forgive you," the girl said. "I loved you, Yuji.
I don't care about Jared. I only want you."</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji?"
said Ai. "What's going on?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
can't explain it," he said. "This is Amniya. She was my
first crush." He rapped his knuckles on the table, then spoke
briskly. "How've you been?"</p><p class="standard">	"Not
well. I felt so bad about what I said. I'm sorry for that," said
Amniya. "I've come back to make it right. We can be together
now."</p><p class="standard">	"How
are you here?"</p><p class="standard">	"My
family moved back here six months ago. I've been searching for you
ever since then. I needed to find you and apologize for everything I
did."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shook his head. "It was never your fault, Amniya."</p><p class="standard">	"It
was. I told Jared what we did." She sat down across from him and
looked earnestly into his eyes. "If I hadn't, none of this
would've happened. We could've stayed together and been happy."</p><p class="standard">	They
were ignoring Ai. Usually, she preferred to be ignored because being
the center of attention made her uncomfortable. Now it gave her a bad
feeling. "Do you know why the place is so empty?" she asked
Amniya.</p><p class="standard">	"It's
really early," said Amniya. Ai heard just a trace of annoyance.
She tried probing Amniya's emotions and didn't get much. "Now
Yuji, we have a lot of catching up to do. Why don't we start with
what you've been up to."</p><p class="standard">	"Not
much. I draw doujinshi now. Amniya, what about what you said at
Jared's funeral?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
didn't mean it. It broke my heart to say it, but my parents asked me
to. They never wanted me to see you again."</p><p class="standard">	"I
was devastated," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"I
know, I know! It was terrible for me too."</p><p class="standard">	"Will
you say it again? From the funeral?"</p><p class="standard">	Amniya
nodded. "Yuji. I can't even look at you. It makes me sick."</p><p class="standard">	"Now
say you don't mean it."</p><p class="standard">	"I
<i>don't. </i>I never did."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
broke in. "Um, I understand you have a lot to catch up on, so if
you don't mind, I'll just slip out." She said it even though she
knew time was running out. If she was right, though, Amniya would
never let her leave.</p><p class="standard">	"No—please
stay," Amniya said. "Yuji, who is your friend? Introduce
me!"</p><p class="standard">	"Of
course," said Yuji. "I know how you like to meet new
people. Amniya, this is Ai Maeda. We're in the same school."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
bowed. "Yes, my name is Ai Maeda. Pleased to meet you. Treat me
well." She gave the formal Japanese introduction because she'd
been taught to. She also gave it because she wasn't sure she liked
Amniya at all. She could sense Yuji's emotions in conflict. Guilt,
nostalgia, and happiness were clashing against each other like
triremes in an Ancient Greek naval battle. One of them would win
before long, and Ai couldn't tell who had more ships.</p><p class="standard">	Amniya
nodded to her, then ignored her again. "Yuji, why don't we eat
some of this pie? It's delicious."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
nodded. He allowed Amniya to cut and serve him a piece, then tasted
it with a teaspoon. "We should've eaten it from the pan, like we
used to."</p><p class="standard">	"Some
things have to change," said Amniya.</p><p class="standard">	"You're
right."</p><p class="standard">	"I
was trying to change things that night. I didn't want to be a child
anymore. I wanted to be an adult, in an adult relationship."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
nodded. "Of course. I understand."</p><p class="standard">	"Can
we be adults now, Yuji?"</p><p class="standard">	"Of
course. Of course, I just need a little time."</p><p class="standard">	"I
was really happy when you saved me from that kid with the baseball
bat."</p><p class="standard">	<i>What's
that got to do with anything? </i>Ai thought. <i>She keeps jumping
around, talking about different things every sentence. </i>It was
time to try and intervene again. "That sounds interesting. I'd
love to hear about that, Yuji."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
didn't look at her, but he nodded. "All right. Amniya and I were
walking past the Qwik-Stop, and this gang of kids came out. The
leader started taunting us—'Do you like girls, Eugene?' and 'My
daddy says you're a Jappo fag, Eugene.' We tried to walk away. He
charged Amniya from behind with a bat, but I side kicked him."
He looked a little wistful, and almost smiled again. "You
laughed at me afterwards. You said I looked so serious. I didn't
understand at all back then, but now I think I do."</p><p class="standard">	"I
remember," said Amniya. "Do you remember why you wouldn't
tell me about Shoko at first?"</p><p class="standard">	The
almost-smile vanished. "Yes."</p><p class="standard">	His
emotions had turned around the second his almost-smile vanished. Ai
tried to intervene again. "Yuji, can you tell me why you like
Amniya? What makes her special." She blushed a little. "I'm
sure if you tell me, she and I can be friends."</p><p class="standard">	"Why?
Well, she's fun. She's really easy to talk to." He wasn't
smiling, but Ai didn't feel the same unease from him. "She was
my friend first."</p><p class="standard">	"I
didn't live up to your friendship," said Amniya. "Yuji, I'm
so sorry."</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
worry about it."</p><p class="standard">	"But
I feel like I betrayed you."</p><p class="standard">	"You
didn't."</p><p class="standard">	Amniya
poured Yuji a cup of coffee. "I want to make this up to you.
Tell me what it's been like for you."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
sat down in a nearby booth. Her feet were beginning to hurt. She
tried to think about Amniya's tactics. It seemed she was just darting
from topic to topic with no direction. Ai reached out her mind to try
and see how Yuji felt. That was interesting; she was getting nothing.
For now, he wasn't feeling any strong emotions.</p><p class="standard">	"Christ,
I've whined enough!" said Yuji. "It's the first time we've
seen each other in seven years." Ai noticed his neck twitch. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Please,
Yuji. I want to know."</p><p class="standard">	He
shrugged. "I haven't wanted to go out with girls at all. I don't
seem to really care about them. Maybe that has nothing to do with
you, though. I have this friend named Allen—"</p><p class="standard">	"Was
it…was it really all my fault?" 
</p><p class="standard">	"No.
After that night, I was so embarrassed I couldn't decide whether I
wanted to do it again or kill myself. But when I finally faced you
after three days, I knew the answer. I loved you."</p><p class="standard">	"Then
if it hadn't been for Jared, we—"</p><p class="standard">	"—would
have probably stayed together, yeah," Yuji finished. 
</p><p class="standard">	
Now Ai picked something up. He yearned. It came quickly and hardened
like cement. Amniya had called up some remnant of his feelings for
her. Ai's watch said it was 6:45. 
</p><p class="standard">	For
a moment, she thought about kissing him again. Maybe she could shift
the object of his longing, or at least confuse him enough to make it
go away. She tried, but she couldn't make herself do it, and the
moment passed. 
</p><p class="standard">	<i>I'm
jumping around just as much as she is, </i>Ai thought. <i>I need to
be rational. This place is empty. It's not just really early. No
one's outside. What's causing it?</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>Put
that way, the answer was obvious.</p><p class="standard">	"Do
you think we can ever be like that again?" Amniya was asking
him. "I mean, love each other like that?"</p><p class="standard">	"It's
a reality bubble," said Ai.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
and Amniya both looked at her. "What are you talking about?"
he asked. He wasn't even concerned, that was the worst part. He'd
asked more from idle curiosity.</p><p class="standard">	"That's
why no one's around. They are around, they're just not inside the
reality bubble." Ai felt blood coming into her cheeks. <i>Stop
it! How am I supposed to look imposing if I'm always blushing? </i>she
told herself. It didn't help; she was blushing again. She plowed on
anyway. "Only one person I know of can make a reality bubble."</p><p class="standard">	She
was going to pop this girl's bubble. She'd found the tap. It had been
there the whole time, hiding in her own mind. It was despicable, like
stealing someone's identity. "Me. Only I can make a reality
bubble."</p><p class="standard">	The
first image that came to her was a huge pin popping a balloon. An
instant later she saw a faucet turning off. Her fingers and toes were
all tingling. She had the odd sense of being turned inside-out and
then back in again, like a shirt. 
</p><p class="standard">	Information
flooded her mind. Names. <i>Arishil The Shining My mother </i>chief
among them, along with <i>Mirabel The Winged My sister Jinjo Rojinjo
The Steel My friend Fung The Sixteen My family Watanabe Irlumarmitpa
wants.</i> Dates. Scraps, like <i>queen drone live breed </i>and
<i>human nyvamna hive esper. </i>
</p><p class="standard">	The
café was full again, but the people walked past without seeing
them. They weren't invisible; a couple walking side by side moved
into single-file to pass Ai. Still, no one noticed them. The
waitresses weren't asking Ai if she needed a seat. No one offered to
refill Yuji's coffee cup, and no one remarked on Amniya's bare feet.</p><p class="standard">	Instantly
the world was alive again. The café was teeming with customers
whose speech melded into wordless noise. Waitresses were coming and
going. She could smell cinnamon, apples, fresh coffee, and frying
sausages. 
</p><p class="standard">	Amniya
didn't like this. "Yuji, this place is a little crowded. Why
don't we go to my house?"</p><p class="standard">	"Please
stop now," said Ai. "I turned off the tap and made the
bubble mine. Yuji won't be meeting Arishil today."</p><p class="standard">	"Anyone
wanna tell me what the hell's going on?" Yuji demanded.</p><p class="standard">	"No.
It didn't work, and there's no use crying over spilt milk," said
Amniya. She stood up. Ai could feel she was nonplussed. "What
did you do?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
stopped you from using my powers on Yuji. Sorry." <i>Why are you
apologizing to her, idiot? </i>"I mean, um, I'm not sorry. Not
at all. No. You were trying to manipulate Yuji. Brainwash him,
right?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
won't tell you anything," said Amniya.</p><p class="standard">	"It's
okay, I know already. You're not really Amniya. Your name is Rebecca.
Your mother is Arishil, Princess of Fung. Um, that kind of sounds
like a word for when a man gropes a woman on a date." She tried
to smile. "You know, like, 'That jerk funged me!'"</p><p class="standard">	Amniya—Rebecca—shook
her head. "This Watanabe likes ditzes, huh?"</p><p class="standard">	Ai
blushed. "Sorry, I'm rambling."</p><p class="standard">	"I'll
be leaving, then," Rebecca said. She circled around the counter
and left the way she'd come. Ai thought about stopping her. She
didn't. The information she'd extracted from Rebecca's mind answered
all her questions. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
was looking at her. She looked away, uncomfortable with his scrutiny.
"Anything you want to know?" she inquired.</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah.
How about everything?"</p><p class="standard">	She
couldn't look at him. She took Amniya's seat and stared at the salt
shaker. "That girl was named Rebecca. She's part of a group
called The Sixteen from the Outer Rim. They call her The Harmony. She
was trying to bring up feelings from your past to confuse you."</p><p class="standard">	"How?"</p><p class="standard">	"B-by
using m-my powers…"</p><p class="standard">	"Your
powers."</p><p class="standard">	"Yes.
I—The truth is, I'm an esper."</p><p class="standard">	He
frowned. "I see why you kept that quiet."</p><p class="standard">	Relief
caved in on her. He understood. He really understood why she hadn't
told him. This might not be so hard. "I, I can create a reality
bubble, which is a little sliver of…you could call it
subspace, in Star Trek terms. I can sense strong feelings outside the
bubble, but I can only use my other powers inside one. Rebecca was
tapping into my powers and trying to brainwash you, and I turned the
bubble around and—sorry, I'm rambling."</p><p class="standard">	"You're
right," said Yuji. "This bubble thing's gone, then?"</p><p class="standard">	A
waitress came and offered to refill their coffee. Ai accepted. She
took a sip, held it in her mouth, and savored it. Much as she loved
tea, coffee had its charm as well.  
</p><p class="standard">	"We
need to talk," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	Breakfast
was too early for alcohol. Yuji tried to substitute coffee. He was
wired as a lemur by the time he started talking.</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
telling you this because I think you actually believe me," he
said. "Everyone else, they all think I'm making it up to be
unique or some crap."</p><p class="standard">	"Of
course I believe you. I can see that something is really bothering
you, and I'm flattered you'd confide in me."</p><p class="standard">	He
made a noise, something like "rph" that might've been a
laugh with more voice behind it. "It was back in Colorado. She
was my first love. We were sitting on the couch one night watching
<i>Excalibur</i>, and on that part when Uther comes in to Igraine to
conceive Arthur, Amniya turns to me and asks if I want to find out
what the feels like. Cue clumsy, creepy, PG-rated loser sex."</p><p class="standard">	"After
that, <i>she </i>pretty much had it. Amniya's brother Jared got
together his Muslim gang and tried to kill me. I ended up killing him
instead. I went to his funeral and she told me she never wanted to
see me again."</p><p class="standard">	"How
did you ever get over killing Amniya's brother?" Ai asked.</p><p class="standard">	"My
grandfather helped with that. I went and stayed with him in Ireland.
He'd killed too, see. So we two Irishmen got drunk, sang The Pogues,
and moped for six months, and at the end I felt better than I ever
had."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
nodded and waited for him to go on. He didn't add anything, though.
She finished her coffee and tried to say something before the silence
got uncomfortable. "Um, what are The Pogues?"</p><p class="standard">	"The
Pogues, me girl, are only the greatest band ever, at least until
McGowan went nutty on acid and got obsessed on Thailand." He
spoke in an Irish accent that brought Ai back to a café in
Waterford where she and Xenophon had used to eat; 'girl' was like
<i>gorrel </i>and ‘nutty’ like <i>notey</i>. "You
know…We walked him to the station in the rain, and we kissed
him as we put him on the train."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
nodded like she knew. "Um, listen, I've got to tell you some
things too, but I don’t think we should talk here."</p><p class="standard">	"Why
not? It's a lovely day, and I'm ready to hear some weirdo crap."</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
I really think we should go somewhere else."</p><p class="standard">	He
scratched his nose and reached for another strudel. "I don't
want to go somewhere else. I want to finish my damn breakfast, and
while I do, I want you to tell me everything I ask and don't give me
any crap." 
</p><p class="standard">	The
quiet venom in his voice was too much for Ai. "All right,"
she sighed.</p><p class="standard">	"Good.
Now first, who the hell was that hracking bitch?"</p><p class="standard">	"Her
name is Rebecca. She's part of an Outer Rim group called The
Sixteen."</p><p class="standard">	"What's
that?"</p><p class="standard">	"They're.
Um. Sorry, when I reversed the bubble I received a bunch of
information from Rebecca's mind, but it's not organized at all. It's
like something I studied a long time ago and haven't thought about
since."</p><p class="standard">	"Okay.
Just get it straight and tell me." Yuji summoned a waitress to
refill his coffee. Ai tensed up. He seemed to get some twisted
pleasure from making her nervous.</p><p class="standard">	When
the waitress had gone, Ai continued. "They're from Fung,
somewhere outside the Grand Zone. Their race has powerful magic, but
their blood is mixed with other races now. Rebecca's mother, Arishil,
is one of the last purebloods. She's the leader of The Sixteen. They
call her <i>Irzratul</i>, The Shining."</p><p class="standard">	"I
hope she doesn't look anything like Jack Nicholson. What did she want
with us?"</p><p class="standard">	"She
wanted to put you into a trance, using my powers, and have Rebecca
bring you to the Outer Rim. But I'm not sure <i>why</i>. That is, I
only know she wanted to bring you there to live with her."</p><p class="standard">	"Let's
ask her, then," said Yuji. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?"</p><p class="standard">	"Sure.
The bloody train runs right into the Outer Rim. Let's go ask the
bitch what she wants with me."</p><p class="standard">	"But—"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
set down his empty coffee cup and looked straight into her eyes. "She
screwed with me. I want to know why."</p><p class="standard">	"But—"</p><p class="standard">	"No.
No but. If you won't come, I'll go alone, but I am going to find out
what this Fung Princess Bitch wants with me and how she knew about
Amniya."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
fell silent. She could see he was never going to be dissuaded. This
angry, stubborn side was the side of him she liked least. It had
gotten him suspended; it had gotten him into a fight with Miba; it
had probably even played a role in Jared's death.</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji,
listen, I don't think it's a good idea for you to go. I already know
Arishil wanted to keep you with her; don't you think if you went
there she'd just trap you somehow?"</p><p class="standard">	"No."</p><p class="standard">	"Let
me go alone," she urged. "I'm of no use to them, but I can
get the information for you."</p><p class="standard">	"How?
Can you suck it out of their brains, like just now?"</p><p class="standard">	She
faltered, and he smiled into his coffee cup. She couldn't see his
mouth, but his eyes showed her. "You can't, can you? And I have
no confidence in your negotiating skills."</p><p class="standard">	"I'll
bring Mariko!" Ai said. 
</p><p class="standard">	She
watched him take that in. The idea had just popped into her head, but
she thought it would sway him. Probably…maybe…but his
expression didn't look promising…but his expression never
looked promising…so in the end, Ai just didn't know. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't want a couple of girls running errands for me," he said at
last. 
</p><p class="standard">	"We
could bring Allen," said Ai. She reddened.</p><p class="standard">	"No,
idiot, I mean I don't want other people doing what I should be doing
myself."</p><p class="standard">	"Please,
Yuji. This could be really dangerous. We're going to the Outer Rim to
speak with some of its most powerful residents."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
sat back in his chair. His eyes went left, then right. He drained his
coffee cup, crossed his arms, and looked straight at her. Ai resisted
the urge to look away.</p><p class="standard">	"You
really think it's that dangerous?" he asked.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
nodded emphatically. "Yes. It's really, really dangerous."</p><p class="standard">	She
let that sink in. She could see him consider, and finally come to a
decision. "All right. We won't go. I don't care how dangerous it
is, I won't have you handling my business." He stood up and
pushed in his chair. "Now, pay the bill and let's go."</p><p class="standard">	For
two cups of coffee and five or six strudels, plus Amniya's pie, it
was eighteen dollars. The high price was just another insult, and one
she didn't deserve after helping him. More than that—she'd
<i>saved </i>him.</p><p class="standard">	After
paying, she left the restaurant and saw Mariko had arrived. Mariko
and Yuji were talking about twenty feet away in front of the bay
windows of Obdachlos Nussbaum, seated on a planter box. 
</p><p class="standard">	"…had
to tell you. But, you know, it's no big deal. If you're not
interested, don’t worry about it."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shook his head. "Let me think about it, please. It's a bad time
right now, but I'll give you a straight answer soon."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
nodded and smiled. "All right." She stood up and noticed
Ai. "Hey, Ren-chan."</p><p class="standard">	"You've
spoken to Akari," said Ai.</p><p class="standard">	"Damn
right. That little gocky's got genky. She told me you'd be here with
Yuji." Mariko paused and stared at Ai for a moment. Ai had the
odd feeling Mariko was appraising her. "Anyway, I'll leave you
guys alone."</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
actually, we were—" Ai began.</p><p class="standard">	"Mariko
has errands to do," Yuji interrupted. "We'll see her
later."</p><p class="standard">	"Later,"
said Mariko. She disappeared into a crowd of tourists that had
swollen like a Zerg hive since Yuji and Ai came through. You could
always tell a tourist from a native. They all wore the same horrible
clothes: the men clad in Hawaiian shirts and cargo shorts, the women
sporting sweatshirts in garish primary colors tied around their
waists to hide their large rear ends. 
</p><p class="standard">	"What
do you want to do now?" Ai asked.</p><p class="standard">	"I
spent last night passed out on hardwood. I've got a headache, either
from drinking or that weirdo bitch's magic spell," said Yuji.
"Either way, I want to go the hell home and sleep."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
blushed. She'd forgotten. "Well, all right. I'll see you later,
then."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
made some sort of grunt and went off.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard"><i>It's
not fair! Why am I poor? I attended community college, so I should be
raking it in! Why am I still a virgin? Admittedly, girls in bars

Railways was owned and operated by elves. The side of each car stated
the company had been in service since July 8<sup>th</sup>, 1964. 
</p><p class="standard">	The
trains ran from Central Station on Dubovy Drive across the Monte
Ciliege and hit the ocean. They didn't stop until they reached the
Outer Rim, a journey of some eight hours by ship, but only about four
across the tracks. They were even faster than Japan's bullet trains.
Humans put this down to some inscrutable elven magic. They were glad
the Treaty of Paris didn't let elven companies come any further into
the Grand Zone than Dubovy Drive's Central Station. 
</p><p class="standard">	As
it happened, the trains ran on technology. Humans could have easily
duplicated it, if any of them had ever bothered to ask. Mirufa was
glad none of them had. Her nephew owned the company. Thanks to him,
she was independently wealthy.</p><p class="standard">	She
could have been reclining on a terrace three miles above the ground
with a daiquiri in her hand and a masseur kneading her sore legs.
Instead she was crouched among the garbage cans behind a kitschy
German restaurant in some human hole, a jogger's sweatband encircling
her head. It hid her ears well enough that no one looked twice. In
order to complete the look, she'd had to wear tiny bike shorts and a
spandex top.</p><p class="standard">	Her
friend Jinjo came from the alley. Jinjo's ears were too long to hide
under a sweatband. They were pulled back, tied together, and woven
into her braid. A black baseball cap held it all together. While
hardly fashionable, it was a warm day and their attire at least did
not look out of place.</p><p class="standard">	"They've
left the restaurant. Without Becky." She spoke the local human
language, English, to avoid suspicion.</p><p class="standard">	"She
failed," said Mirufa in the same language.</p><p class="standard">	"Now
she's gone home to sulk and dumped this mission on us. What are we
supposed to do? We're only here as backup."</p><p class="standard">	"We
must try something. Our lady will be disappointed if we return
without at least arranging a meeting."</p><p class="standard">	Jinjo
shook her head. "Guess this is what you get when you drag The
Treated into a mission that's meant for The Harmony." 
</p><p class="standard">	Mirufa
nodded. "Truly. What shall we do?"</p><p class="standard">	Jinjo
shrugged. She knelt down beside Mirufa, opened her fanny pack, and
took out an energy bar. "Dunno. S'pose we could just knock him
on the head and drag him off."</p><p class="standard">	Mirufa
shook her head. "Let us speak with him first. The Harmony's
tactic was hostile. If we come forward peacefully, he may be inclined
to listen." She peered through the alley into the main square
and saw the Irlumarmitpa had left the restaurant. He was speaking to
another human girl. The esper emerged a moment later. She wondered if
the esper was his lover.</p><p class="standard">	"Gah.
What a joke, this mission," Jinjo spat around a mouthful of
raisins and granola. "It's not even our concern."</p><p class="standard">	"It
is our concern so long as we serve Lady Arishil as members of The
Sixteen," said Mirufa.</p><p class="standard">	"Okay,
fine. But look at what we're here for. Look at that." She jerked
a thumb towards the Irlumarmitpa. "What do you see?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
see what you see," Mirufa answered calmly. "A crawling baby
human."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	She
didn't really want to follow him. He didn't say anything, but she
could tell he wasn't pleased. But his train station was the nearest
one, and Ai needed to get all the way across town.</p><p class="standard">	It
was good that she did.</p><p class="standard">	The
Ataraxia Lane South station was little more than a few benches and a
roof hanging over the tracks. A single bored guard sat in a cubicle
next to a rack of schedules. He was there to make sure no one tried
to rob the turnstiles and to answer stupid questions from tourists.</p><p class="standard">	As
they came up the stairs, a blonde woman approached them. She was
Mariko's height, with pleasant features and pretty blue eyes, but she
had dressed herself in some awful exercise video outfit. 	"Excuse
me, are you Yuji Watanabe and Ai Maeda?"</p><p class="standard">	"Who's
asking?" said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	The
woman bowed very low and swept off her grey sweatband like a hat.
"Good morning. My name is Mirufa Lumbil." When she came up,
Ai realized she had pointed ears. They were smaller and less
prominent than those of other elves Ai had seen. "Also called
The Mindful."</p><p class="standard">	"One
of The Sixteen," Ai supplied.</p><p class="standard">	"Correct.
We'd like to speak to you. Is there somewhere we might converse in
private?"</p><p class="standard">	
Ai felt a surge of worry. She looked to Yuji. He glared at Mirufa
through squinting eyes, reminding her of Clint Eastwood in <i>The
Good, The Bad, and the Ugly</i>. Not worried at all. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Sure,"
he said. "How about my house? Back terrace'll be nice this time
of day." Ai marveled at the calm in his voice. He might have
been planning a nice tea.</p><p class="standard">	Another
woman came around the corner. Tall, hard-faced and stern, she wore an
equally horrible exercise outfit. Her ears disappeared into the
Mizutama Manta Rays baseball cap she wore over her purple braid.</p><p class="standard">	"This
is my partner, Jinjo Rojinjo. Known to us as The Steel," said
Mirufa, gesturing to the second elf. "Jinjo, the Irlumarmitpa
has agreed to meet with us."</p><p class="standard">	"I
was kinda hopin' he'd put up a fight," said Jinjo.</p><p class="standard">	"I
still might," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	</p><p class="standard">	Mirufa
and Jinjo did not speak during the five minute ride to Yuji's house.
Yuji followed their lead, so Ai remained silent as well.</p><p class="standard">	
Behind the small circle of townhouses where he lived, a field of dead
crabgrass and thistle spanned nearly to the foot of the mountains.
The architects had cemented over part of the field and turned it into
a rear patio for the houses. Rather than take his guests through the
house, Yuji opened the gate and took them straight to the terrace.
From there, Ai could smell the chlorine of the neighbors' pool, but
all the Watanabe family had was a set of rusty patio furniture. 
</p><p class="standard">	"It
would be rude for me not to offer my guests refreshment," said
Yuji. "Ai, would you please help me in the kitchen?"</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
sure," Ai agreed. She would have done anything not to be left
alone with Jinjo and Mirufa.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
actually did make tea and drag out cookies in his kitchen before he
spoke. "What d'you reckon? Going to them was dangerous. They
came to us."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
walked past him to the end of the kitchen and stared at his breadbox
for a second, leaning her hands on the counter for support. "I
really don't know." She turned around and paced towards the
table. "I don't like it. Rebecca had backup. Why didn't she call
them when she failed? Why did she just run off and pout?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shrugged. "Does it matter? What should we do now?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't know…" Ai completed another circuit, breadbox to
table. "They want you to meet Arishil, I know that, but does it
need to be on good terms or would she take you dead? Or concussed? If
it comes to fighting, they're not much of a threat. I mean, they are,
but less than some of the other members…I just don't know."</p><p class="standard">	"Great,"
said Yuji. "Thanks for all your help."</p><p class="standard">	She
blushed. "I'm sorry, I know I'm not much help."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shrugged again. "Here." He handed her the tray. "Bring
this out. I'll be along in a second."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
found herself walking as slowly as she could to cut down her time
alone with the two elves. Despite this, she reached the patio before
Yuji reappeared.</p><p class="standard">	The
two elves stopped talking as soon as she appeared. She could feel
them watching her as she set down the tray, turned over two cups, and
poured each full of green tea. They drank, Mirufa daintily and Jinjo
with more gusto. Next Ai poured herself a cup and took a seat next to
Jinjo. She was the bigger, but somehow it was Mirufa who frightened
Ai. 
</p><p class="standard">	"You're
the esper," said the blonde elf.</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,"
Ai replied. 
</p><p class="standard">	"You
thwarted The Harmony and stole from her mind certain information."</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,"
Ai replied.</p><p class="standard">	"Know
that this information is of little value to us. We do not care that
you have it."</p><p class="standard">	"I
understand," said Ai. She blushed. "I, I know you would
never be afraid of me, no matter what information I have, a-and I
don't blame you, I-I wouldn't f-fear me either." <i>You sound
like an idiot, </i>she chided herself.</p><p class="standard">	Mirufa
gracefully nodded. "You cannot stop us. We will bring the
Irlumarmitpa to bow at the feet of The Shining."</p><p class="standard">	"If
you don't mind me asking, what is the…" She struggled
over the word. "Irlumarmitpa?" 
</p><p class="standard">	"None
of your business," said Jinjo. She poured herself more tea
without asking and slurped it down, dripping some on her spandex top.

</p><p class="standard">	"It
is enough that you know the Irlumarmitpa is very important to us,"
said Mirufa. "We will not leave without him."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
unfortunate," said Yuji. He came through the backdoor in time to
hear Mirufa's comment and placed a tray of cookies on the table.
"Because I have no intention of going with you."</p><p class="standard">	"Irlumarmitpa,"
said Mirufa. "Forgive me. I only meant that the esper does not
need to know these things. Of course we will explain to you."</p><p class="standard">	"Good,"
said Yuji. He took the seat next to Mirufa. Ai was glad he was here.
"Start talking."</p><p class="standard">	
Mirufa took a cookie before she began. Ai saw it was a yatsuhashi.
Hailing from Kyoto herself, she took that as a sign of good taste.</p><p class="standard">	"My
lady Arishil will explain these matters in more detail. For now I
will say this: my lady is of the race of Fung. Once, in times gone,
they were able to see into past, present, and future. It is my lady's
greatest desire to rebuild her people, but she cannot do so without
you, the Irlumarmitpa."</p><p class="standard">	"And
what is an Irlumarmitpa?" Yuji asked.</p><p class="standard">	"It
is not for me to explain. If you would accompany us to visit Lady
Arishil, she will tell you all."</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't think so," said Yuji. He nodded at Ai. "She says
going into your den is a bad idea. I believe her. Besides, if I go
with you, I'll miss 'Eat Your Carrots Meow'. It's only on Saturdays
at 13:00."</p><p class="standard">	Jinjo
laughed. "You're a ballsy bastard, Irlumarmitpa, but I don't
remember when we said you had a choice."</p><p class="standard">	"What
do you mean?" said Ai.</p><p class="standard">	"None
of your hracking business," Jinjo answered.</p><p class="standard">	"She
means that our lady wishes to see the Irlumarmitpa. No matter how we
get him to her," said Mirufa.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
stood up. "Okay, discussion's over. Please leave my house."</p><p class="standard">	"Irlumarmitpa—"
Mirufa began.</p><p class="standard">	"Sorry,
no. You'll have to pitch me a better spiel than that. What, I should
schlep all the way to the Outer Rim for a 'you'll find out when you
get there'?"</p><p class="standard">	"You
little—!" Jinjo burst out. She stood up as well. "Fine.
I wanted this all along anyway." Mirufa made to rise, but Jinjo
waved her back. "I'll handle this, Mirufa."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
moved away from the table, into the open space at the center of the
patio. Jinjo followed. She made the first attack, throwing a
roundhouse kick at Yuji's left ear. Yuji blocked easily, catching her
foot on his left forearm.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
sensed his powers activate. She couldn't see anything, but she could
feel it, like she felt Akari sneak up behind her. Yuji's foot slammed
into Jinjo's shin, and at the same time he pushed away her leg. She
stumbled off balance and he swept her foot out.</p><p class="standard">	Jinjo
teetered but regained her footing. Instantly Yuji fell on her. He
hooked a punch at her face. She blocked and returned with a
roundhouse. Yuji blocked with his left knee. She threw a left. Yuji
sidestepped it, seized her arm in his left, and seized her neck with
his right. He was standing next to her, holding her almost like they
were doing a tango. Then his right foot swept her left, and he pushed
her face away, executing a takedown.</p><p class="standard">	Jinjo
seemed for a moment to lay on an invisible bed. Yuji followed through
and slammed her to the ground. He twisted around her, trapping her
left arm in his grasp, and drove his right elbow straight into her
nose. He did it again, then again, three brutal strikes.</p><p class="standard">	With
a groan, Jinjo grabbed his belt with her right hand and heaved him
over. She rolled on top of him, but both her hands were trapped. Yuji
copied her; he grabbed her belt and her shirt collar and flipped her
over his head, tossing her onto her back. He scrambled to his feet—an
instant later, so did Jinjo.</p><p class="standard">	"I
habn't had a fight this good in a while," said Jinjo. Her nose
was squashed and she had blood running down her face. In contrast,
Yuji wasn't hurt at all, at least that Ai could see.</p><p class="standard">	"Shut
up and fight," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	They
circled a bit. Neither seemed willing to get in another grappling
match. Jinjo began making faux starts. She jerked forward like she
was making a charge, then stopped. Ai could see Yuji wasn't fooled at
all. He stayed steady. 
</p><p class="standard">	Jinjo
jerked forward, leaning in aggressively. Yuji's lead fist snapped
forward and his backhand bounced off her forehead. 
</p><p class="standard">	His
left leg swung around and slapped her side. He sprung off that same
leg and his right leg came over Jinjo's head. His jumping axe kick
brought all his one hundred and eighty pounds through his heel and
down onto her head. He threw himself to the ground, rolled away, and
leapt to his feet. Now he was at Jinjo's left side. As she turned to
face him a front kick snapped her head back. He used his lead foot to
pull himself forward and drive a side kick into her stomach. 
</p><p class="standard">	It
should have been the last hit. Any normal opponent would've gone
down. Jinjo reeled. She swung her fists wildly. Yuji caught one on
each forearm and then wrapped his arms around hers to trap them.
Three roundhouse kicks went into her sides, then Yuji swung her
around like a square-dancing partner and released her. She ran at
him. Instead of fighting, Yuji ran away.</p><p class="standard">	He
led her towards the wall of his house, keeping about ten feet between
them. Yuji made an absurd jump ten feet into the air. He kicked off
the wall like a swimmer, floated downwards at a 45-degree angle, and
drew back his right leg.</p><p class="standard">	His
side kick hit her jugular like a sledgehammer. Ai could swear she saw
Jinjo's face turn the same color as her hair. She went down. Yuji
landed next to her head and seemed ready to about face and punch the
living daylights out of her if she got up. She didn't.</p><p class="standard">	For
about thirty seconds, Ai didn't even hear Jinjo breathing. Yuji's
blow almost certainly would've killed a human. But after the
thirty-second mark, Jinjo began to suck in huge gasps of air. She
didn't seem to be conscious.</p><p class="standard">	Mirufa
rose and cried <i>"Nisahrairpa!" </i> An invisible force
sank into Yuji's stomach. He doubled over with pain. Her hands and
fingers were stirring and shaking; first she looked to be petting a
cat, then making yarn on a loom, then playing a violin. She looked
epileptic or insane, but the force pounded Yuji left and right. He
tried to approach and his feet went from under him, toppling him onto
his back.</p><p class="standard">	"I'll
put you to sleep," said Mirufa. "I didn't want to do this,
but you've forced us. Lady Arishil does not stand for refusal."
Ai could see bruises all over his face, but he wasn't bleeding
anywhere. Fear welled up inside her.</p><p class="standard"><i>	You
can't let them do this. What did you come for?</i></p><p class="standard">	<i>Nothing!
I came to get Akari out of my house!</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	But
you're still here. Do something, dammit! Don't just blush and go home
meekly and stew in your own moe while Akari fondles your boobs!</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>Even
that wasn't enough. So Ai pictured herself going to Yuji's parents.
She pictured herself trying to tell them. What would she say? <i>Gee,
I'm sorry Mr. and Mrs. Watanabe, your son is the Chosen One from an
ancient prophecy and now he's got to visit with the Queen of the
Faeries. No, sorry, there's no getting around it. No, he won't be
able to get a college exemption, because you see these are
supernatural beings from beyond space and they're not drafting him,
they're just taking him. No need to thank me, it was my pleasure.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>Given
the choice, she'd rather die. But she didn't think anyone would need
to die today.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
focused on making a reality bubble. This was only the fourth time in
her life she'd made one herself. The key was to relax; let the gates
open a little, but not all the way. Let out a trickle of power.
Enough to fill an inflatable kiddy pool. Enough to dampen the ground.
Enough to mist the flowers. There it was…now, release it.</p><p class="standard">	There
was no obvious physical change. No one disappeared; Ai had included
them all. Mirufa had begun to incant: <i>"Nilueazmirpakuu.
Nilueazmirpakuu. Nilueaz—" </i>Her voice stopped
mid-sentence. An old-fashioned sponge was stuffed in her mouth.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
was standing about thirty feet from Yuji. Next moment, without
seeming to move, she was kneeling beside him. "Yuji, are you all
right?"</p><p class="standard">	"I've
been better," he muttered. His teeth were tinged red and his
face was a mass of bruises, but he didn't seem seriously hurt.</p><p class="standard">	Mirufa
yanked the sponge from her mouth and threw it to the ground. "What
is this?" she demanded.</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't need Rebecca's help to make a reality bubble," said Ai.
She was trembling, but her voice was steady for the moment.</p><p class="standard">	Mirufa
tried to speak again, but a load of mush came out. "Eeooemeepakeeee…"
Her tongue had vanished.</p><p class="standard">	"I-I
won't let you t-take him without a f-fight," Ai mumbled.
"L-leave n-now."</p><p class="standard">	She
let Mirufa's tongue reappear, but the elf's expression told it before
her mouth. "We cannot leave without completing our mission."</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji
s-stays or we f-f-fight to the e-e-end," Ai stammered. Mirufa
took a step towards her. "Stay back!" she commanded.</p><p class="standard">	Mirufa
obeyed. She looked at Jinjo, then at Yuji, and then at Ai. "It
is not for you to set terms," she said. There was less threat in
her voice.</p><p class="standard">	In
answer Ai set her gaze on Jinjo. There was a theatrical flash of pink
smoke, and Jinjo was gone. Now a white rat stood in her place.</p><p class="standard">	<i>I
wish everything I did in here didn't look like something from a Roald
Dahl movie, </i>Ai thought.</p><p class="standard">	<i>"Nis
irpamirakurha!" </i>Mirufa said. The instant she did there was
another flash of pink smoke and the white rat remained.</p><p class="standard">	"Let
us treat."</p><p class="standard">	"I-I'm
not w-w-willing to c-c-compromise," Ai stammered. Her voice
shook. She wasn't confident at all. But she had the power in here.</p><p class="standard">	"You
are able to void my magic the moment it is cast. You could force us
to leave. But I, and my lady, do not wish for things to end this
way."</p><p class="standard">	"What
do you want?"</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
believe the bitch," Yuji muttered. He sat up, coughed twice, and
took three deep breaths. "If you can get rid of them, do it."</p><p class="standard">	"But
Yuji…"</p><p class="standard">	"I
know, they'll just keep coming after me. I don't care. For now, get
them out of here!"</p><p class="standard">	"But—"</p><p class="standard">	"Listen,
you were right and I was wrong. If they get me, you'll never get to
gloat."</p><p class="standard">	She
reddened. "I don't want to."</p><p class="standard">	"Then
get rid of them for its own sake!"</p><p class="standard">	"I…"
Ai teetered on the edge.</p><p class="standard">	"He's
correct," said Mirufa. "Even if you use your power to get
rid of us for now, my lady will keep coming after you."</p><p class="standard">	"Unless
she kills you," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
was shocked. She tried to look inside herself and see if she could
really kill them. Nothing. She had enough power to kill them, but she
could never make herself do it.</p><p class="standard">	Mirufa
seemed to have come to the same conclusion. "This can all end
peacefully. Come and speak with my lady." 
</p><p class="standard">	"Sorry,
but that's why we're fighting in the first place," said Yuji. He
tried to stand up. Ai moved to help. He waved her off, came to his
feet, and drew himself to his full height. He was nearly a head
taller than Ai, and suddenly Mirufa didn't seem so scary anymore.</p><p class="standard">	"I
offer my word that while we travel in the Outer Rim, no member of The
Sixteen shall make any hostile action towards you."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
nice, but if you do break your word, there's not much I can do but
whine."</p><p class="standard">	"We
of The Sixteen do not break our word," said Mirufa. "However,
I understand your concern. The esper may accompany you."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
tensed at being mentioned. She edged closer to Yuji. "I don't
think this is a good idea."</p><p class="standard">	"I
have to disagree. Gotta tell ya, I'm not looking forward to them
chasing me for the rest of my life. And you can't kill them, can
you?"</p><p class="standard">	Ai
hesitated. "No. I…I can't."</p><p class="standard">	"Then
let's try this." Before she could speak, he said, "We've
decided to accept your offer. Just so long as you pay for the train
tickets."</p><p class="standard">	</p><p class="standard">	Ai
had never been to Central Station before. She was no provincial;
she'd been to some of Tokyo's biggest stations, but Tokyo didn't have
anything close. Japan's white, modern look had melded with the grand,
monolithic stations in England and created this. 
</p><p class="standard">	White
marble tiled the floor; Ai's shoes made a loud clack with every step.
Eight stone pillars the size of aircraft carriers kept the whole
works suspended off the ground. Catwalks and balconies crisscrossed
above their heads, and tracks crisscrossed above those. These tracks
launched people to Ode, to Mizutama, and even to the Outer Rim.
Nowhere else in the entire Grand Zone reached the last. 
</p><p class="standard">	They'd
had to wait twenty minutes for Mirufa to revive Jinjo. The latter
hadn't spoken since she awoke. Ai thought she might be sulking.</p><p class="standard">	Mirufa
led them along. Escalators carried passengers from the earth into the
heights of the station. They took one to the first level. Even though
the sun was bright overhead, only a fraction of its light reached
this deep into the station. 
</p><p class="standard">	They
found an automated kiosk nestled between a drugstore and a clothing
shop. Ai saw Mirufa enter a request for four tickets to the Outer
Rim, two of them round-trip and two one-way.</p><p class="standard">	Train
departs at 10:15, 11:00, 11:30, 12:45, and 3:16, it informed them.
Your total is: $348.20</p><p class="standard">	Mirufa
confirmed the purchase. Please swipe card or insert cash in slot. She
looked at Jinjo. The other elf opened her fanny pack and handed over
a debit card.</p><p class="standard">	The
machine spat out four tickets. Mirufa handed them around. Yuji's went
into his hip pocket, while Ai placed hers in her purse between a
compact mirror she'd never used and a copy of <i>The Moon is Down</i>
that had seen better days.</p><p class="standard">	The
seats in the train were big and comfortable. There were only two per
row; Yuji and Ai sat in Row 8 and Jinjo and Mirufa took Row 9. The
car was nearly empty.</p><p class="standard">	"Why
d'you suppose it's so dead in here?" Yuji said.</p><p class="standard">	"I
guess the Outer Rim isn't very popular," Ai replied. There were
six other people in a railway car that seated fifty. Two of them were
elves, both female, seated three rows ahead of Ai and Yuji. They
spoke animated Mestaera, their flowing lilac hair rippling like reeds
in the wind. Ai caught a little of what they said; they seemed to be
talking about the manga <i>Ninjin o Tabete Nya</i>, known in English
as<i> </i>'Eat Your Carrots Meow'. The car also housed four other
humans; a young Japanese couple seated three rows back, and two men
in black suits and ties across from and one row behind the elves. 
</p><p class="standard">	Ai
guessed the couple was doing some adventure tourism; the other two
men looked like police or secret agents. They eyed the elves with
suspicion, but Ai didn't think it was because they were elves. The
men looked like the sort who distrusted anyone that didn't speak
English in public. She decided to put it to the test.</p><p class="standard">	<i>"Yuji-san,
watashi no uchi ni yuugohan wo tabe kiitemasen ne?" </i>(Yuji,
want to come to my house for dinner?) she asked.</p><p class="standard">	<i>"Nani,
Nihongo shabetagaru? Doushita n da?" </i>(What, you want to
speak Japanese? What's this about?) Yuji responded.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
checked the response of the men in suits. They were still staring at
the two elves. She shook her head. "Never mind. Um, it's
nothing."</p><p class="standard">	A
conductor came around and collected their tickets. This train only
made one stop in the Outer Rim; after that it was necessary to take
connecting lines. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji,
I still think this is a bad idea," Ai whispered. Jinjo and
Mirufa seemed to be talking about something else and not listening.</p><p class="standard">	"Objection
noted. Now enjoy the ride."</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji—"</p><p class="standard">	"No,"
he cut her off. "This is best. And haven't you always wanted to
see the Outer Rim? Now enjoy the ride. I'll be counting on you when
we get there."</p><p class="standard">	She
blushed and fell silent.</p><p class="standard">	The
train was beginning its gentle climb over the Monte Ciliege. This
mountain chain stood to the west, between Sakura Memorial and the
sea. Deep oak forests spread below them. Flocks of birds came
screeching from the trees, disturbed by the train's passing.</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
what did Mariko want to talk about?" Ai asked. She didn't know
if he would answer or not.</p><p class="standard">	"She
asked if I wanted to go to the arcade. I said no."</p><p class="standard">	"I
wish she didn't have to call me Ren-chan too. It's bad enough from
Akari."</p><p class="standard">	"What's
wrong with it?"</p><p class="standard">	"It's
not my name," said Ai.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
stared out the window for a moment, then looked around the train car.
"It's better than your name."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
blushed. "But I like my name."</p><p class="standard">	"It
doesn't work in English. It sounds like 'I'. Don't you get confused?
If somebody says 'her and I' you never know if she's talking about
you or herself. If somebody says 'the evil eye', how do you know if
they're calling you evil or not?"</p><p class="standard">	"I've
never been confused by it before…"</p><p class="standard">	"I
guess it's not as bad as being named 'Yuu' though. 'Hi, I'm Yuu.'
'You're me?' 'No, I'm Yuu.' 'That's what I said—you're me?'
'No, my name is Yuu!' 'Oh, your name is You.'"</p><p class="standard">	"I
suppose that would be confusing, but nothing like that's ever
happened to me before."</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
even if it never confuses you, it confuses other people. Change it.
You're being inconsiderate by keeping that name."</p><p class="standard">	She
decided to ignore him until he could talk sense again. 
</p><p class="standard">	The
train peaked over the Monte Ciliege and began running downwards
towards the ocean. Ai moved to the other side of the car so she could
watch the golden waves ripple under the morning sun. The seagulls
dipped and soared above the water. They would be heading down the
coast for Mizutama, where they could eat well of the tourists'
garbage.</p><p class="standard">	"Mariko
wouldn’t have come all that way just to ask you to go to the
arcade," said Ai. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?"
Yuji said.</p><p class="standard">	"Why
did she really come?"</p><p class="standard">	"Are
you reading my mind?" he asked wryly.</p><p class="standard">	"No,
I can't, and I would never, but it doesn't make sense. If she just
wanted to go to the arcade, Akari would have gone."</p><p class="standard">	"Saying
you can't and then saying you never would doesn't make sense. If you
can't, how do you know you wouldn't if you could?"</p><p class="standard">	"So
why go to the trouble of tracking us down? Of tracking <i>you</i>
down?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shrugged. "You got me. It was a date."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
stopped. "Oh no, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry." 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
crossed the aisle and sat next to her. "Mariko came and asked me
if I wanted to date her."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
waited, curious to know more, embarrassed to ask. "Did—you
say yes?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
said I'd think about it," Yuji answered. 
</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	The
idea of the Outer Rim was spectacular.</p><p class="standard">	The
fact of the Outer Rim was disappointing.</p><p class="standard">	The
train glided across the water and passed over a tiny rise that led
between two large precipices onto Úpa Island. Below them, Ai
could see the wooden roofs and cobblestone streets of a small town.
The train began making its descent into the station, not much more
than a creaky wooden platform. 
</p><p class="standard">	The
conductor made them wait five minutes before allowing them to
disembark. Yuji and Ai walked behind the young couple and ahead of
the two elves, still chattering in Mestaera. The young couple were
also speaking in rapid Sakura Japanese, a dialect of Japanese
influence by English as much as Sakura English had been by Japanese.
Jinjo and Mirufa came last.</p><p class="standard">	"This
place looks like the set for a Dickens movie," said Yuji the
moment they were on the platform.</p><p class="standard">	The
town certainly was quaint. All the buildings were made of wood, and
all the streets paved with stone. Everyone was on foot; cars were
absent. The same iron lampposts Ai had seen in a London museum served
for streetlights. They were the lights by which all the infamous
Jacks, like Jack the Ripper and Spring-Heeled Jack, had committed
their crimes.</p><p class="standard">	The
group of passengers dissipated and Jinjo and Mirufa flanked Yuji and
Ai. "We have a car down here," said Mirufa, motioning down
the stairs. She had it parked next to a tent where an older elf sold
cheap jewelry. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Let's
get this over with," said Jinjo. She opened the back door and
waved them inside. Yuji got in without complaint.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
hesitated. "Um, actually, I get motion sickness. Very badly.
Could I sit in the front?"</p><p class="standard">	It
was a lie; she didn't want to make it possible for these two to trap
her and Yuji in one sweep. Jinjo scoffed, but Mirufa nodded. "Very
well. I will ride in the back."</p><p class="standard">	The
inside of the car was roomy, with seats upholstered in black leather.
Ai smelled only leather oil and cool air; when Jinjo went to light a
cigarette, Mirufa stopped her. Jinjo snarled and put it away. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Let's
get going," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"You
heard him," Mirufa added. Jinjo started the car and began around
the town's perimeter, carefully avoiding the walkers. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
where are we going?" Ai asked. No one answered her. "All
right. We're going to the Irpazm Tree, right? That's where Arishil
keeps her seat, even though she still dreams about going back to
Fung."</p><p class="standard">	"Fung,"
said Yuji appraisingly. "That really does sound like a word for
when a man gropes a woman on a date. 'Dude, I funged her and she
slapped me!' I can imagine hearing that from Allen."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
blushed, but she appreciated his support. "Right? I'd slap Allen
if he funged me."</p><p class="standard">	"I
bet I could fung Mariko, though," said Yuji. "She'd enjoy
it."</p><p class="standard">	"What
nonsense do you speak?" Mirufa said. Her voice had risen a
little. Ai could feel the smallest edge of anger from her.</p><p class="standard">	"We're
making fun of you," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"We
know everything you extracted from The Harmony," she added to
Ai. "Your knowledge does not stir us."</p><p class="standard">	"We
just wanted to bring you two down a notch," said Yuji. "Tell
me about this Orgosm Tree."</p><p class="standard">	"Irpazm
Tree," Mirufa corrected.</p><p class="standard">	"You'd
get more business with my version."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
enough!" Jinjo snapped. "You're nothing but Lady
Arishil's—"</p><p class="standard">	Mirufa
raised a hand to silence her. "Your chatter means nothing. You
are powerless. Lady Arishil predicted your every move."</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't think that's true," said Ai. Jinjo and Mirufa glared at
her. She looked down at her own lap tried to find interest in the
fabric of her skirt. "Um, I always heard no one can tell the
future, a-and Yuji's n-not that easy to read. Not for someone who
doesn't know him."</p><p class="standard">	They
both ignored her. "You've foolishly stepped into our lady's
trap," said Mirufa. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
grinned. Ai could see him in the rearview mirror. Most of the time,
he was handsome. Not stunningly so, but easy enough on the eyes. Now
he was the shark-like rapist-hero of a hardcore erotic game.</p><p class="standard">	"Just
shut up and drive," he said.</p><p class="standard">	The
car left the town and came onto dirt roads. Through the window, Ai
could see farms and orchards. Closer to town the lands were clear,
and ranchers ran cattle and sheep. The further they went from town,
the more forested it became. Out here fruit trees grew, not in
orderly rows like human orchards but all over and under each other.
It was too cold for citrus; most of the trees bore a pale pink fruit
like a long apple. 
</p><p class="standard">	Ai
asked what the fruit was. She was ignored.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	Before
too long, they left the countryside and came to thick forest. A dirt
road cut through the trees; the branches above were woven together so
tightly that Jinjo had to turn on the headlights. Soon the car
reached a hill so steep Jinjo had to creep along at twenty miles per
hour.</p><p class="standard">	When
they finally reached the top, the forest broke and offered Yuji and
Ai their first sight of the Irpazm Tree. Gnarled branches reached
outward towards the four corners of the earth, and upward towards the
heavens in defiance of God's will, like nature's Tower of Babel.
Neither leaf nor flower graced the treetop; instead its limbs were
alight with a thousand shining globes, like tiny fireflies. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Big
deal," said Yuji. "You live in a tree."</p><p class="standard">	"As
will you, very soon now," said Mirufa.</p><p class="standard">	"I've
heard it. Soon I'll be Princess Arishil's love slave. Just drive."</p><p class="standard">	The
dirt road twisted around the hill onto flat ground. They sighted the
first mile-high root of the Irpazm Tree sticking up from the ground
soon after hitting the flats. There were no trees or plants in this
area. The only sign of flora was a few shrubs, and fauna seemed
absent. The Sixteen didn't need to grow food; the elves of the town
gave them heaps of it every week. As a tribute. Ai had it from
Rebecca's own mind.</p><p class="standard">	Jinjo
drove to the foot of a towering staircase and parked. Ai gladly left
the car behind. She followed Yuji towards the entrance. Ai had seen
some long staircases in Europe, but this one trumped them all. She
tried to look towards the top and ended up facing the sun. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Well?"
Jinjo growled at Mirufa. "Let's get this over with."</p><p class="standard">	The
blonde elf straightened her cloak very deliberately.  <i>"Vàetaca!"
</i>she cried.</p><p class="standard">	Just
like that, the staircase was gone. Now in its place a tunnel
stretched into darkness ahead of them. "That's a neat trick,"
Yuji commented.</p><p class="standard">	"I'll
take the lead," said Mirufa. "Jinjo will take the back. The
Irlumarmitpa will follow me. You." She pointed at Ai. "You
will follow him."</p><p class="standard">	They
began in single file. When it became too dark to continue, Mirufa
spoke a low word and a sphere of light appeared in her hand. She
walked ahead, holding the globe high to light their path.</p><p class="standard">	As
impressive as the magic was, its actual result was mediocre. Ai
tripped and stumbled on every rock that came underfoot. A regular
battery-powered flashlight would've worked better. She became so
absorbed in avoiding the rocks that she didn't notice when Yuji
stopped walking, and she ran into him. 
</p><p class="standard">	He
glanced over his shoulder. She blushed and moved away. 
</p><p class="standard">	They
had come to a high gate of bronze, chained shut with a padlock. Ai
judged that a somewhat strong man could probably tear the gate off
its hinges with his bare hands. Mirufa ordered it to open in
Mestaera, just as she had the staircase. The padlock fell off and the
gate swung open.</p><p class="standard">	Mirufa
led them through a much shorter tunnel into a shallow pit. The floors
and walls were made of thick, tough tree roots woven together like
yarn in a sweater. The walls stretched high above their heads. It was
up a short staircase and out of the pit into the main hall. Globes of
light drifted around the roof like planets in a solar system, casting
a dim glow over the hall. Rebecca's information told Ai that the
walls were coated with bioluminescent moss. 
</p><p class="standard">	The
room stretched out in all directions as wide as the Central Station
back in Sakura Memorial. It reminded Ai at once of a Roman cathedral
and an aquarium. Despite the room's largeness, it had a
claustrophobic feeling. There were no windows and no apparent doors
anywhere.</p><p class="standard">	"Rebecca,"
said Mirufa. To Ai's left, the roots parted and allowed a small,
brown-haired girl to emerge. Clothed in flowing white robes like an
Egyptian princess, she approached them with confidence and grace.</p><p class="standard">	"Hello
again, Yuji. Ai," she said.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
found herself bowing. <i>Stop that! </i>she urged, but it was too
late. Yuji made no move.</p><p class="standard">	"As
we predicted, the Irlumarmitpa has arrived," said Mirufa. "Has
Lady Arishil made ready to receive him?"</p><p class="standard">	"She
awaits your report in her chamber," said Rebecca. "Then she
will receive our guests. I am to keep them until she is ready."</p><p class="standard">	Mirufa
nodded. "We shall make our report." She and Jinjo went
through the roots, leaving Yuji and Ai with Rebecca.</p><p class="standard">	"You
may wish to sit down," said Rebecca. She motioned towards two
wooden kitchen chairs that hadn't been there a moment ago. Ai's feet
were throbbing inside her shoes, so she took the offer. Yuji remained
standing.</p><p class="standard">	"You
don't look like Amniya anymore," he said.</p><p class="standard">	"No.
I could only maintain that illusion so long as you believed it,"
Rebecca answered. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
then how did you still do it after we figured out you weren't her?"
asked Ai.</p><p class="standard">	"You
still believed I <i>looked </i>like her," said Rebecca. "I
merely obliged. I am The Harmony."</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,"
Ai agreed. "You can mislead our minds. Whatever we want to
believe, you can make it seem true. But it won't actually be true
without my help."</p><p class="standard">	"I
can make alive your darkest fears or your greatest desires,"
said Rebecca.</p><p class="standard">	"No,
you can't," said Ai. "Sorry. I mean, no. Um. That is to
say, without my reality bubble it's all in the person's mind. If Yuji
had touched you after I closed the bubble, he would've felt you, not
Amniya."</p><p class="standard">	"You
are speculating based on incomplete evidence," said Rebecca. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
think she's right, though," said Yuji. "Without her powers,
you're nothing."</p><p class="standard">	Rebecca
shrugged and turned around. "Mother, these humans are fools.
Please hurry down."</p><p class="standard">	The
roots parted, and she entered. 
</p><p class="standard">	She
was tall, of noble visage, and her blonde hair fell to her waist. She
wore a pile of white robes like a Japanese kimono wrapped in a
European cloak. She was beautiful in a way Ai had never seen before:
dignified, gracious, delicate, gallant, demure, grand. There was age
in the way she carried herself, but her green eyes sparkled with
youth. A peculiar mix of tension, fear, affection, relief, and
excitement swept over Ai as she came in. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Greetings,
Yuji Watanabe," she said. <i>"Mapatihruurhaa vapawïkuutïh."</i></p><p class="standard">	"Hey
derry tum gardol," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
laughed nervously. The majestic blonde woman didn't seem amused. "You
must be Ai Maeda. Your presence here is not welcome. Leave us."</p><p class="standard">	"She
stays," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	The
woman gave a gesture of assent. She came to Rebecca's side. "I
am Arishil, Princess of Fung." Then she smiled. "You <i>are
</i>handsome, aren't you?"</p><p class="standard">	"Not
really," said Yuji. "No offense, but maybe you want to tell
me why your daughter decided to come screw with me on my day off.
Make it good."</p><p class="standard">	"Of
course," said Arishil. "Please sit down."</p><p class="standard">	"I'd
rather stand," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"As
you like." Ai noticed that two more chairs and a table had seen
fit to appear while her attention was focused on Arishil. The table
was laid out with a noon meal of tea and bread. "But please eat,
at the very least."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
was famished, so she took a piece of bread. Arishil glared at her. It
made her blush, but she wasn't about to put the bread back. Once Yuji
saw it wasn't poisoned, he sat down and had some.</p><p class="standard">	"My
home, Fung, lay far away," said Arishil. "Many of your
people's lifetimes have passed since it was destroyed by our enemies,
and I led what remained of us to this archipelago."</p><p class="standard">	"Bummer,"
said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"We
were greater then, and able to see into the past, present, and
future. I planted this Irpazm Tree, whose seed I carried with me from
the destruction of Fung, and regained dominion over the past and
present, but the future continues to elude me."</p><p class="standard">	"Bummer,"
said Yuji again.</p><p class="standard">	"Before
my people descended into pettiness and small evils, one of the elders
told me of a vision. He said I would meet a man whose blood would
rejuvenate our people. He called this man the Irlumarmitpa, which
means 'from whom they spring.' He told me that when I encountered
this Irlumarmitpa, I must mate with him to rebuild the people of
Fung."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
stared at her for a moment. Then he burst out laughing. "You're
kidding me, right? This is a dream. I've been waiting for years to
have the dream where a hot blonde queen asks me to mate with her to
save her race."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
blushed. She knew, fantastic as it seemed, this wasn't a dream. "Um,
you r-really think Y-Yuji is the…" She struggled over the
word again. "Irlumarmitpa?"</p><p class="standard">	"We
know that he is," said Rebecca. 
</p><p class="standard">	"You
think a mediocre, porn-drawing nyvamna and C-student is the savior of
your race?" said Yuji. "This tree must be full of
psychedelic moss."</p><p class="standard">	"The
prophecy states the Irlumarmitpa will be a man between his fifteenth
and twentieth years," said Arishil. "He will be nyvamna, of
course. He will be skilled in battle and wise in the ways of life."</p><p class="standard">	"You're
describing the hero of an RPG, not me," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"He
will be of two peoples, and by his father will come of elven blood.
He has known love and come from it wounded."</p><p class="standard">	"That
could be anyone."	</p><p class="standard">	"Also,"
Arishil added, "he will have the friendship of espers."</p><p class="standard">	"Now
you're just making things up."</p><p class="standard">	Arishil
smiled.</p><p class="standard">	"Anyway,"
Yuji continued, "I haven't got the friendship of espers. I've
got the friendship of esper, and not much of one. She doesn't even
rape, pillage, and rob. She is to espers what carob is to chocolate."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
didn't know whether to feel praised or insulted, so she didn't say
anything. She didn't need telepathy to see that Yuji was getting
agitated. His shoulders were tense and his movements were rapid. He
reached for the teapot and upset the breadbasket. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Dammit,
I've had enough!" he blurted out. "We're leaving. Come on."
He took Ai by the arm and guided her towards the door.</p><p class="standard">	"Wait!"
Arishil called. "Please, wait."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
didn't think waiting was a good idea at all, but Yuji did it. "What?
If I don't hear something I like in the first sentence, I'm leaving."</p><p class="standard">	"I
understand how shocking this must be. I also understand that The
Harmony, The Steel, and The Mindful attempted to bring you here by
trickery and force. I assure you I did not permit them such
liberties. These actions were taken against my explicit orders to
bring you to me peacefully."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
didn't go back to her, but he did turn around. Ai saw Rebecca staring
bashfully at the table. Perhaps Arishil wasn't lying, but Ai still
thought it was a bad idea to trust her too easily.</p><p class="standard">	"I
will not force you to do anything, Irlumarmitpa. Your role in the
minds of The Sixteen has been a strange one. You are thought of at
once with great respect and with great contempt."</p><p class="standard">	"Why?
How does one human kid you've never seen inspire those kinds of
emotions?" Yuji said.</p><p class="standard">	"It
is difficult to explain, Irlumarmitpa," said Arishil. She rose
from the table and approached. She was even taller than Ai had at
first thought. Her hands settled on Yuji's shoulders, and the ends of
her golden hair dangled in his face. It was only a friendly gesture,
but Ai saw Yuji tense. 
</p><p class="standard">	Arishil
ran her long graceful fingers from the nape of his neck up to his
hairline. It was a more sensual act. Ai blushed. She expected Yuji to
become tenser, but instead his shoulders loosened up and his
breathing slowed. "You would not be badly treated,
Irlumarmitpa." Her soft voice soothed Ai. "You would have
the best foods, fine wines, and any amusement you wish. You would be
served, pampered—"</p><p class="standard">	Perhaps
it was the last word that did it to him. Yuji shook his head. "Sorry.
Nice as that all sounds, I have to say no."</p><p class="standard">	"No?"
Arishil repeated as if she didn't quite believe it.</p><p class="standard">	"No.
Sorry. I'm sure you're real nice and all, but it sounds like you're
offering to make me into a baby again. I was a baby once, Princess
Arishil, back when I knew Amniya. I'm pretty glad not to be anymore."</p><p class="standard">	"Very
well," Arishil answered. "As I said, I will not force you.
However—would you be willing to speak with me again? On more
neutral ground?"</p><p class="standard">	"Okay,"
Yuji agreed. Ai noticed how easily he gave in. It was impossible to
miss: he wanted to see Arishil again.</p><p class="standard">	"Perhaps
you might attend a ball. It will be held in Nandul, Sakura Memorial
in three weeks, by Prince Vanadiel Thaddeus Egwimphron of Montagria.
It is for those wishing to enroll in his family's private school,
Gottslehrer Academy. You will soon receive a notice for this event.
Your friend Ai here may attend. Any other friends you wish to bring
may also attend."</p><p class="standard">	"Why?"
Yuji asked. Ai was puzzled as well.</p><p class="standard">	"I
and some of my people will also be in attendance. I simply wish to
become better acquainted with you."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
and Ai exchanged a glance. She figured he was thinking what she was:
what in hell was going on? Was it a trap? He seemed to be asking her
opinion. She shrugged apologetically.</p><p class="standard">	"All
right. We'll come," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	Arishil
nodded and curtsied with much grace. "Very good. It would be
very time-consuming to walk back. I will have Mirufa and Jinjo drive
you. Please wait outside."</p><p class="standard">	<i>"Qapla'!"
</i>said Yuji, by way of parting.</p><p class="standard">	When
Yuji and Ai had left, Arishil asked Rebecca to summon Mirufa and
Jinjo. The two elves came through the roots into the main hall.</p><p class="standard">	"Were
you able to observe the workings of the reality bubble?" she
asked of her subordinates.</p><p class="standard">	"I
was," answered Mirufa. "It can be broken, my lady. I do not
yet know how, but I believe a method can be devised.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	They
boarded another train with their second tickets. Ai had been so
exhausted she'd fallen asleep with her face resting on the cool
window. She woke up halfway through the trip to find Yuji had also
fallen asleep. He'd reclined his chair beforehand, so with the
bruises he looked like a dead tourist entombed in a train seat. Ai
felt sorry for him, but there wasn't anything she could do.</p><p class="standard">	<i>He
dragged you there! </i>she told herself. <i>He deserves what he's
got. He's just lucky he didn't get more.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>That
was true, but Ai couldn't help feeling sorry for him anyway.</p><p class="standard">	She
had woken him when they pulled into Central Station. He had mumbled,
"Huh? When did I fall asleep?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
woke up and you were asleep," said Ai.</p><p class="standard">	"Hmm.
I was watching you. It was like one of those calendars where they
show you all these pictures of kittens asleep in a pile, and it's so
cute you almost want to flush them down the toilet or hack them up
with a hatchet."</p><p class="standard">	The
young Japanese couple had accompanied them back. Ai and Yuji slipped
off the train while they were packing up luggage. They found an
escalator and descended the tower. 
</p><p class="standard">	"What're
you going to do?" Yuji asked once they were outside. 
</p><p class="standard">	Ai
checked her watch. It was nearly six, and she was famished. "I
guess I'll go home and make dinner and then take Akari to the
arcade."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
nodded as if he'd never seen life quite like that before. "I'm
goin' down Neon-way," he said. "Gonna drink meself fifteen
pints of beer."</p><p class="standard">	They
parted at the corner. Ai waited for a bus. She only had three dollars
in her purse now. Buses mainly went to the suburbs anyway.</p><p class="standard">	A
bus pulled up to the stop, but it was going the wrong direction. It
had just come from the suburbs. Only three people got off: two male
yuppies and Mariko, who was frantic.</p><p class="standard">	"Ren-chan!
My god, why don't either of you carry a cell phone?" she cried.</p><p class="standard">	"What's
wrong, Mariko?" Ai asked, keeping her voice as low as possible.
But she thought she already knew what had Mariko so spooked. <i>Why
would she—</i></p><p class="standard">	<i>Because
she's a crawling baby human.</i></p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard"><i>Roulette
wheels go round and round. The wheels on the bus go round and round.
The moon goes round and round the earth, which goes round and round
the sun, which goes round and round the galaxy, which goes round and
round the universe. We can't see it, but it does. Our lives go round
and round too, but sometimes we can't see that either.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>Next

      <h2 class="heading"><a id="Episode_8_-_So_You_Walked_Back_in_the_Revolving_Door_and_Did_It_All_Again"></a></h2>
      <div class="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard">	At
2:34 P.M. the police received a panicked 9-0-0 call from a man thirty
years younger than his current squeeze, Ms. Kazuko Kanzaki. He was at
Ms. Kanzaki's place of residence. The lady of the house was absent,
and there was a dead teenager in the bathtub.</p><p class="standard">	The
police, the fire department, and the paramedics made all speed. They
arrived at 2:40 P.M. to find a naked girl half-drowned in a mixture
of tepid water and her own blood. She was going but not yet gone. The
ambos tied off her wrists, which had been slashed open with a box
cutter, and raced off to the hospital to give her a transfusion.</p><p class="standard">	Given
the state they'd found her in and the used condom floating in the
bathtub, the police had not ruled out a rape-murder. They had grilled
Ms. Kanzaki's current boyfriend, who denied ever seeing the girl
before. He'd been placed under arrest pending further questioning.
The circumstantial evidence and his testimony that he'd been living
with Ms. Kanzaki for five weeks were both against him, and assertions
such as, "Yo man, if I was gonna rape a girl, why would I use a
condom, eh? I'd take that little nugget bare, know what I'm sayin'?"
probably didn't help either.</p><p class="standard">	The
police detective then made a mildly illegal search of the bathroom
and found a cell phone under a pile of clothes. He took a mildly
illegal look through the phone's contact list and made a few calls.
First he called Bistro La Pucelle and asked if they employed this
girl. The manager said yeah, she was one of his waitresses. The
detective wrote down her name and called it in to the hospital. Now
that they had a medical history, they could give her a transfusion.</p><p class="standard">	Next,
the detective called Akari Kanzaki. She was the only person on the
contact list with the same last name. He'd expected a mother, but
instead he got a kid sister. He told her the news and asked where he
could find their mother. Younger Kanzaki said she didn't know. The
detective asked where she was and she said she was at a friend's
house. The detective knew Younger Kanzaki was from Japan. Natives had
an American's confidence that the cops could sort out anything. A cop
couldn't get a straight answer from a Japan native about what five
movies she'd want if she were trapped on a desert island. He decided
to give it up and told Younger Kanzaki what hospital her sister was
in.</p><p class="standard">	As
soon as Younger Kanzaki got rid of the cop, she called Mariko. She
didn't know what else to do. Ren-chan and Mr. Watanabe didn't have
cell phones, and Marie-neechan was Oneechan's closest friend.</p><p class="standard">	Luckily,
Mariko was at home, five minutes up the street. She came down right
away and picked up Akari. At  3:15 P.M. they boarded a bus to the
train station. At 3:30 P.M. they boarded a train to Dubovy Drive
South, where Byouin General Hospital could be found. At 3:55, after a
short walk, they arrived.</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
was in Room 2-01. She was sleeping when they arrived. The paramedics
hadn't brought her glasses. When she woke up she wasn't happy to see
them. Not see them. Whatever.</p><p class="standard">	She
looked terrible. Her cheeks were ashen, her hair limp and greasy.
Bright red bloodlines ran through her eyeballs. Bandages sheathed
both wrists. She wouldn't talk to them at first. Then she told them
she'd tried to cut out her tongue, but the box cutter wasn't sharp
enough. She lisped through it.</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
asked her why. 
</p><p class="standard">	"La
Tirelire doesn't carry tiger-striped handbags," said Yumiko.
"They only carry leopard-print."</p><p class="standard">	Later
Yuji found out everything, and he laughed and laughed until he cried.
Then he said, "."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
didn't go to the Neon District. The Neon District was a place where
you got venereal diseases, not drinks. 
</p><p class="standard">	Instead
he stopped at the liquor store and bought a twelve-pack of dark beer.
It was foul stuff—Yuji preferred a good brandy—but he
didn't want to get drunk. He just wanted to relax.</p><p class="standard">	The
days events were too strange, too surreal, for him to think about. So
he certainly wasn't going to tell anyone. He came home and found his
mother and Shoko both gone. That was good. Then the phone rang.</p><p class="standard">	He
didn't usually answer the phone. He'd just let it ring and ring and
ring. If not for Allen answering the phone, he never would've gone to
meet Ai today. He was going to ignore this call.</p><p class="standard">	The
phone kept ringing. He was halfway down the stairs, his first bottle
of rubbery dark beer open, when he came down with the urge to talk to
someone. He turned around, pounded up the stairs, and grabbed the
phone off the hook just as it uttered its last ring.</p><p class="standard">	"Hello."
He tried to sound blasé, like he hadn't just hurtled up the
stairs to get this call, and mostly succeeded. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Mr.
Watanabe?"</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
hi Akari." He began to regret picking up.</p><p class="standard">	"Could
you…come to the hospital?"</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?"
He set down his beer.</p><p class="standard">	"Marie-neechan
and Ren-chan are here, but could you come too? Please?" He could
see her on the other end, putting on her best adorable nymphette
face. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
grabbed the beer and gulped down half the bottle. The bitter swill
singed his uvula on the way down. "What's going on?"</p><p class="standard">	"It's
Oneechan. Could you please come? Marie-neechan and Ren-chan want you
too. It's Byouin General Hospital, Room 2-01."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shrugged. "Sure, all right. Why shouldn't I run off to visit
someone who repulses me." He hung up, cutting off Akari's
response.</p><p class="standard">	He
wasn't a good guy. Maybe that was why he went. Maybe he wanted to
laugh at Yumiko. Maybe he wanted to stand by her bed and mock her.
That could be why he gulped down three beers in as many minutes and
went out the door. That could also be why he boarded the train to
Duso, Dubovy Drive South End, and got off at the station. And it was
entirely possible that was why he walked to Byouin General Hospital. 
</p><p class="standard">	Or
maybe he just had an urge to talk to someone.</p><p class="standard">	The
hospital stood like a tombstone in its own shadow. It was one of the
city's smaller hospitals, and it sat on a field of thistles and dead
grass that had been an empty lot twelve years ago. The sign stated
"Byouin General
Hospital", as dry as that.</p><p class="standard">	It
was the perfect place to laugh at someone.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
passed through the automatic doors. A sticker notified him the
plastic in them was bulletproof. The yuppies and yuppettes of the
South End were now safe from Neon District gangs. The pillars of
society would not be knocked away.</p><p class="standard">	The
waiting room was a world of grey carpet and bleary fluorescent light.
Three receptionists bustled behind the desk. One saw him and asked
what she could do for him.</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
here to visit the patient in Room 2-01," he said. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Are
you a friend of hers?" the receptionist asked.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
paused. "No," he said. "I'm a friend of a friend."</p><p class="standard">	"That
poor girl," the receptionist sighed. "It's always so sad
when someone so young goes that far. It's just good she was found
when she was."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
agreed, even though he still didn't know what had happened. Yes, it
was good. 
</p><p class="standard">	The
receptionist told him that visitors were limited to four at a time,
so he would be the last one admitted. If her parents arrived, he
would be asked to leave. Yuji nodded. He didn't think her parents
would arrive.</p><p class="standard">	The
elevator arrived and he boarded it. He rode to the second floor.
Unconsciously, he started humming a song. It was 'The Sickbed of
Cúchulaínn', the first song from the second album by
The Pogues. 
</p><p class="standard">	He
got off at the second floor. Room 2-01 was just across the hall. He
pushed open the door and entered.</p><p class="standard">	The
centerpiece of the room, propped up on pillows, leafed through a
fashion magazine while the others clustered around her. Her shoulders
dropped, her eyes were glassy, and the Gordian Knot had taken
residence on her head. Bandages encircled both wrists. 
</p><p class="standard">	Akari
came to him, beaming with delight. "Mr. Watanabe! I didn't think
you'd come!"</p><p class="standard">	"I
wasn't going to," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
stared at him. It wasn't her usual glare, full of contempt. She
looked like a tired old woman. Yuji noticed that despite the open
magazine, her glasses lay on the bedside table.</p><p class="standard">	When
their silent staring contest entered its third minute, Yuji broke it
off. "You look like the bitch."</p><p class="standard">	"You
look like the bastard," she replied. It came out <i>bathtard</i>.</p><p class="standard">	"Nice
lisp. Why'd you try to off yourself?"</p><p class="standard">	"Didn't."
She held up her wrists. "My mom's boyfriend did this to me."

</p><p class="standard">	The
looks on the others' faces told Yuji he'd guessed correct and Yumiko
was lying. He smiled and shook his head. "Okay. Then why is—"</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji,"
Mariko interrupted. 
</p><p class="standard">	Akari
offered her chair. Yuji sat down and resumed the staring contest. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Why
is—"</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji,"
Mariko interrupted. He looked at her for the first time since
entering and stopped. He hadn't imagined Mariko could look so
worried. Her usual wide smile had flipped into a short parabolic
frown. Her shoulders slumped and her dull eyes stared at nothing. 
</p><p class="standard">	He'd
been an idiot. He'd come to laugh at Yumiko the psychotic harpy while
Mariko suffered over her. He didn't give a damn what Yumiko did to
herself, or what happened to her, but he liked Mariko too much to put
more stress on her.</p><p class="standard">	He
stood up and offered the chair back to Akari. "Sorry. I
shouldn't've come. See you later."</p><p class="standard">	"Wait,"
Yumiko mumbled.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
stopped and glanced over his shoulder. Her bandaged hand reached out
to him like a revived mummy. "What?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
want to talk to you." She shooed Akari off the chair and shoved
it at him. "Everyone else, get out. Please."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
headed for the door right away. She seemed relieved to be going.
Akari came shortly after. Mariko stayed. "Don't. This isn't the
right time to be self-destructive."</p><p class="standard">	"It's
the perfect time," said Yumiko. She waved Mariko towards the
door. 
</p><p class="standard">	"So,
I have to ask again," said Yuji once Mariko was gone. "Why'd
you try to off yourself?"</p><p class="standard">	"Remember
how I used to date old guys?"</p><p class="standard">	"Sure.
Comedy gold."</p><p class="standard">	"I
thought it was disgusting, but I realized that's wrong thinking. I
mean, they want to be seen with a young girl, and I want the money.
Who's getting hurt?"</p><p class="standard">	"No
one," Yuji agreed. <i>Except the guy doing it with my sister. </i>
</p><p class="standard">	"So
I joined a teleclub and hooked up with a client. Know how that
works?" Yuji shook his head. "I give my cell number to the
company, and they email it to potential clients. The clients call me
and I decide if I'm interested."</p><p class="standard">	"I
found a nice old guy and started dating him. I was makin' ten-fifty
an hour, plus tips. Then I found out I'm pregnant, so he pays for
some shady back-alley abortion, and…"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
was about to interrupt when he realized he didn't know what to say.
His skin crawled with faint disgust, like he was watching a cockroach
crawl in and out of a corpse. 
</p><p class="standard">	"…anyway,
he promised to buy anything I wanted as a reward for saving his
marriage, so I asked for a tiger-striped handbag from La Tirelire.
But they don't have 'em. They only have leopard print. So here we
are." She held out her wrists. 
</p><p class="standard">	There
were only two ways to interpret her lack of emotional reaction during
this speech. Either she was so tired, so drained, that she had gone
numb, or</p><p class="standard">	"You're
lying," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
not lying," she replied. No pique. It was a good act, but Yuji
was sure he was right.</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't know why, though. We don't like each other. I can see why you'd
lie to Mariko, but why bother telling me anything?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't—"</p><p class="standard">	"Why,
I wonder, come up with this implausible lie? Maybe there's some
answer on your medical chart." Yuji plucked the clipboard from
its hook on the back of the door and looked down it. "Ooooh,
this is interesting—<i>Patient intoxicated at time of
admittance</i>. So you downed a few cool ones and made up some armere
story about an abortion. I bet the doctors wouldn't find any evidence
of that if I asked them, either."</p><p class="standard">	"You're
so smart."</p><p class="standard">	"Say
what?"</p><p class="standard">	"You're
too smart. I can't trick you," Yumiko sighed. "I was lying.
This was just a cry for attention."</p><p class="standard">	"What're
you talking about?"</p><p class="standard">	She
pushed off the blankets and rose from the bed. Her hospital gown hung
off one bare shoulder. Yuji noticed a plum-colored welt at the base
of her neck. Taking her glasses from the bedside table, she crossed
the room in three long, quick strides and came to within four inches
of him. He didn't like her that close; his throat felt exposed.</p><p class="standard">	"The
truth is, I wanted you to notice me," said Yumiko. She opened
the glasses, pushed them up her nose, and peered at him through the
lenses. "It's been like that ever since I saw you."</p><p class="standard">	"What
the <i>bualadh craicinn</i> are you talking about?"</p><p class="standard">	"I've
been attracted to you ever since you first came to the bistro. I
acted out because it seems like Mariko always gets the cute ones. And
I knew…" She pushed her gown off the other shoulder and
took Yuji by the neck. "I knew you felt the same."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
pushed her arms off his neck. "Time to say goodbye." 
</p><p class="standard">	He
felt Yumiko's hand probing his thigh and shoved her away. "It
was a nice visit." Yuji pulled the door open. "You'd better
leave soon, or the hospital will take your liver for the room fees."
 
</p><p class="standard">	"Playing
hard to get won't fool me," Yumiko said as he left. Yuji decided
to let her have the last word.</p><p class="standard">	The
others sat on a bench down the hall. When Mariko saw him, she jumped
up. "What'd she say?"</p><p class="standard">	"She's
crazy, Mariko. She probably thought she was Emily Dickinson and had
to commit suicide to preserve history." 
</p><p class="standard">	The
elevator opened. A nurse came into the hall, a plump older woman with
dark hair. "Excuse me, are you family of the girl in Room 2-01?"</p><p class="standard">	"She
is," said Mariko, pointing to Akari. "The rest of us are
just friends." She glared at Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
I just wanted to let you know the police want to hold her for
questioning," said the nurse. She spoke to Akari, who glanced at
Mariko so much that the nurse spoke to Mariko instead. "Her
clothes and other items have been confiscated for evidence, so you
may want to go home and get her something to wear."</p><p class="standard">	"We
will. Thank you," said Mariko. 
</p><p class="standard">	The
nurse nodded. "I'm so sorry for all of you. It must be
terrible."</p><p class="standard">	"We're
just glad she's okay," said Mariko. She glared at Yuji again and
didn't stop even after the nurse had gone.</p><p class="standard">	"Definitely
suicide, then?" he asked in a cheeky, cheery London accent. "I
couldn't get a straight answer from her," he added, dropping
back to his normal voice.</p><p class="standard">	"We
couldn't either," said Akari. "First she said Mom's
boyfriend attacked her, then that she tried to kill herself because
La Tirelire doesn't carry tiger-striped handbags."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
decided he would get nothing but glares from Mariko, and addressed
his questions to Akari. "Did you know anything about her doing
enjo kousai again?"</p><p class="standard">	Akari
shook her head. "But I've been at Ren-chan's."</p><p class="standard">	"She
would <i>never </i>do that crap again!" Mariko insisted.</p><p class="standard">	"She
told me she did," said Yuji. "Then she told me she was
lying because she wanted attention. From me."</p><p class="standard">	He
didn't enjoy her shocked look as much as he'd thought. Maybe because
it was Mariko. He noticed for the first time that her hair wasn't
bound up in its usual pigtails. It looked good.</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
maybe instead of speculating, we should look for evidence to back up
one of her stories," Ai suggested. Yuji had almost forgotten she
was here. He wondered if she'd spoken about their adventure in the
Outer Rim. Probably not. She'd save it for a less dire moment.</p><p class="standard">	"What
do you mean?" Mariko asked.</p><p class="standard">	"First
of all, what story did she tell you, Yuji?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
told them. For Mariko's sake, he tried not to laugh. Only Ai seemed
unaffected. The other two showed disgust and distress. 
</p><p class="standard">	"We
have three stories," said Ai. "Two of them involve the
handbag. We can admit the possibility that that part is true.
Otherwise, they don't add up."</p><p class="standard">	"What
makes you think she's lying?" Mariko demanded. Ai shrunk back.  
</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
bully the armadillo," said Yuji. "Let her finish before she
rolls over."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
tripped over her words for a while, and they waited for her to
finish. "Um, they don't add up," she repeated, "so
they can't all be true. The police will decide whether the boyfriend
was involved. If we could get hold of her cell phone, that would let
us decide if the story about going back to enjo kousai is true, but
the police have all her personal items."</p><p class="standard">	"Why
don't we just leave it to them?" said Yuji. "I know you're
all her friends, but we're not cops or psychiatrists. Nothing good
can come out of us pretending we are."</p><p class="standard">	"I
want to help my friend!" said Mariko. "I'm not playing at
being an unfeeling bastard like you are!"</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
not playing. I don't like her, I don't trust her, and I don't think
she deserves your friendship."</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
why don't we take this down to the cafeteria," Ai said quietly.
She motioned at Room 2-09. A man in a ten-gallon hat was giving them
the indignant look usually reserved for people who talked in movie
theaters.  
</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
fine," Mariko grumbled. 
</p><p class="standard">	The
four of them took the elevator to the first floor and followed the
signs to a Starbucks filled with washed-out fluorescent light. Aside
from the waiting room, it was the only carpeted room Yuji had seen.
Aside from the folding metal chairs, it was the same lousy coffee and
crappy easy listening music as any Starbucks. They even had a shelf
of wide hardcover coffee table books. Yuji drifted towards these,
with Mariko beside him, while Ai and Akari headed for the counter to
order.</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
sorry," said Yuji. He meant it.</p><p class="standard">	"You
don't have to apologize." Mariko grasped her forehead with
exasperation. "She doesn't make things easy." She took out
<i>1001 Wicker Chairs </i>and glanced at the blurb on the dust
jacket. "Maybe a nice wicker chair would make her feel better."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
didn't know if she was joking or serious, but Yumiko did not make
things easy. It was no wonder she couldn't take care of Akari; she
couldn't even take care of herself. He wondered if Shoko would become
like that after a few years. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Okay,
maybe Ai's right," Mariko said. "We have to be systematic
about this."</p><p class="standard">	"Right,"
said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't think Yumiko would go back to enjo kousai, but that doesn't
mean she wasn't with a man."</p><p class="standard">	"You
think she had a regular, age-appropriate fling and turned it into
enjo kousai?"</p><p class="standard">	"It's
possible. Look, Yuji, I've known Yumiko since I was little. What
she's most afraid of is turning into her mother. It's why she's
been—" Mariko glanced at the counter to make sure Akari
was still out of earshot. "It's why she's been so afraid of
screwing up with Akari. Because her mother used to go through a
cycle. Usually she'd be out drinking and partying, but then something
would happen and she'd start hating men and paying lots of attention
to Yumiko."</p><p class="standard">	"Then
after about a month of hugs, kisses, amusement parks, and new
clothes, Yumiko would ask for something. Didn't matter what. And her
mother would scream at her and call her a greedy monster, and it was
back to partying."</p><p class="standard">	"Pretty
much like Yumiko screaming and throwing things at Akari," said
Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"The
point," said Mariko, "is that if she did that to Akari and
then went and slept with some guy, she'd be the same as her mother."</p><p class="standard">	"You
really think that'd drive her over the edge?"</p><p class="standard">	"It
might. She's been afraid of it ever since Akari came to live with
her. That's why she's been so distant."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
picked up a book called <i>The 90's in Pictures. </i>He couldn't
think of anything that had happened in the nineties worth recording
in pictures. Maybe the theatrical release<i> </i>of <i>Austin Powers:
International Man of Mystery</i>. "If she's taking out her
phobias on Akari, I don't have any sympathy."</p><p class="standard">	
"Since when do you care about Akari?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
pretended to be interested in <i>Cloud Patterns Over Venice</i>. "I
like the little gocky. I tried not to, but I do. Ai called me to meet
this morning because having Akari stay over is too much for her. She
called <i>me</i>, because Yumiko is psychotic and you're her
facilitator."</p><p class="standard">	"I
am not her facilitator!" Mariko protested.</p><p class="standard">	"She
keeps acting psychotic because you let her."</p><p class="standard">	Any
argument Mariko might have had voided when Ai and Akari returned with
four coffees. "Um, I wasn't sure what you liked, Mariko,"
said Ai. "I got you a cappuccino. I know you like yours black,
Yuji." He took the coffee and reached for his wallet to pay her
back, but she waved him off. "Actually, Akari paid for these."</p><p class="standard">	"I
wanted to thank you guys for coming here," said Akari. "I
was really scared when the police called me."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
offered her the eight dollars. She shook her head. "It's okay.
I'm just really glad you came, Mr. Watanabe."</p><p class="standard">	"Just
take it," said Yuji. "I have plenty of money."</p><p class="standard">	He
saw her struggle, and finally she took it. 
</p><p class="standard">	She
took Mariko's money too. She didn't want to, but her wallet was empty
now and she didn't like having to ask Ai for things. It didn't feel
good to just take money from whoever gave it.</p><p class="standard">	They
didn't talk about Yumiko again. Akari knew Mr. Watanabe and
Marie-oneechan had been discussing her while she and Ai ordered, but
now they seemed determined not to bring it up. That was fine; Akari
didn't want to talk about her either. 
</p><p class="standard">	After
drinking her coffee, Akari said goodbye and left to get Yumiko some
clothes. She walked all the way to their mother's mansion apartment
in Dubovy Drive South, hoping the whole time that no one was there.</p><p class="standard">	The
car wasn't out front, so that made her tentatively hopeful. She went
up the stairs and opened the door with her key. She stared at the
Chiizu keychain on her ring for a minute and smiled. Akari was really
frightened. She hadn't wanted to come back here, and her heart
wouldn't slow down. But chibi Chiizu was just so damn cute she had to
smile.</p><p class="standard">	She
went into the apartment. The police had roped off the bathroom with
yellow police tape, but there wasn't an officer in sight. There were
no cars outside, either. Obviously they were handling this with as
much skill as the Miba incident.</p><p class="standard">	Akari
went downstairs to her and Yumiko's room. The apartment had three
bedrooms, but Haha had set up her boyfriend in the second-largest
bedroom. Yumiko had hung a cloth to separate the room in two. Akari's
side had a bed and boxes and suitcases with all of her things, while
Yumiko's side had a dresser and cabinets. 
</p><p class="standard">	She
looked through the closet for a suitcase, but Yumiko didn't seem to
have one, so she emptied one of her own suitcases and began to pick
out clothes. She took each article of clothing out, unfolded it,
looked it over, then searched for something that matched well. She
picked out three outfits and then remembered Yumiko probably wasn't
staying in the hospital past tonight. Oh, well.</p><p class="standard">	Akari
began to dig through the bedside table's drawer for Yumiko's spare
mobile phone. She overturned ribbons, thread, and jewelry and pricked
herself on a needle before finding it. She turned it on to make sure
the battery was charged. The clock read 5:40. It would be dark soon.
The sun was already sinking outside. 
</p><p class="standard">	Akari
put the phone in the suitcase and then noticed something else on the
beside table. It was a pin. Made of gold it looked like, or maybe
brass, it was a football pointed downwards as if falling to earth,
behind three red <i>r's</i>. Akari turned it over. A safety pin-style
clasp. 
</p><p class="standard">	Then
Akari noticed a sock sitting on the bed. A white athletic crew sock.
She'd seen it before and thought nothing of it, but now she realized
Yumiko didn't wear socks like that. It was a man's sock. 
</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	Ai
had said goodbye to everyone and left the hospital to get home in
time to make dinner. Yuji had offered to walk her home. It wasn't
that she needed protection from scary rapists. Not her, the Carob
Esper. But Yuji wanted to talk, and maybe he'd get some free dinner.
God knew he could use it.</p><p class="standard">	"So,
I noticed you double-timed it out of there when Yumiko cleared the
place," he said. It was a cool evening, perfect for cold beer
and stargazing on the terrace. They were walking to the train station
rather than taking a bus. 
</p><p class="standard">	"She
scared me," Ai mumbled.</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yumiko
scared me. I was afraid of her, afraid of Mariko, of everything. I
just couldn't handle it."</p><p class="standard">	"What
else is new?" Yuji deigned to glance at her. Unlike some people
who looked like gargoyles in bad lighting, the streetlamps gave Ai a
much needed air of mystery. She was like Artemis, Goddess of the
Moon. And she did look haunted. He decided she'd been through enough
today. Truth be told, so had he, and teasing her was an outlet, but
an unfair one.</p><p class="standard">	"I
wasn't even as scared of Arishil as I was of her. Because…I
can't just make a reality bubble and save Yumiko."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
that's where this is going."</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji,
please." She was really in distress. All right, he'd really stop
this time. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Gomen,
gomen. You've never been around deranged people, huh?"</p><p class="standard">	"My
cousin Yithion has learning disabilities, but no, I've never been
around someone who was suicidal." She brushed her hair from her
eyes. Somehow the dim light made the gesture sensual.</p><p class="standard">	"So,
speaking of Arishil, are you coming to this ball with me?" Yuji
asked.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
shook her head. "I don't know. I just don't know, Yuji. I'm not
made for this…" 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
wasn't actually asking. I was telling. You're coming to this ball, so
get your hair done, your nails manicured, and buy a new dress. I
wonder if Mariko would like to come?" Mariko had enough things
to worry about, but if Yuji could stop her from learning why he was
going, she might have a good time.</p><p class="standard">	He
looked at Ai and she subsided. "Clothes aren't a problem. I have
enough."</p><p class="standard">	"Good.
Now you can look hot for the prince." 
</p><p class="standard">	Ai
didn't speak the rest of the way to the train station. She seemed to
be thinking. Yuji just watched her. A hot blonde queen wanted to mate
with him, his mortal enemy was in the hospital, and it was a
beautiful evening. Everything was grand.</p><p class="standard">	The
next train to East Proastio Heights wasn't coming through for twenty
minutes. Ai sat down on a bench to wait. Yuji didn't feel like
sitting. He felt antsy. He stood and leaned on the vending machine.
<i>Give me a leather jacket and I'd be a rebel without a cause</i>,
he thought.</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji,"
said Ai.</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?"</p><p class="standard">	"Can
I ask you something?"</p><p class="standard">	He
shrugged. "Sure, I guess."</p><p class="standard">	"You
really don't mind?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
won't know until you ask, and then it'll be too late."</p><p class="standard">	She
waited and seemed to consider that. "All right. Are you going to
date Mariko?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shrugged. "You may be a few years ahead in school, but your
head's filled with dating just like all the other little girls."</p><p class="standard">	The
dim light threw the bright pink blush into relief. "It's not!
I'm not like Aka—I mean, all of them!"</p><p class="standard">	"You
just blush when anyone displays prurient interest in you, instead of
perking up."</p><p class="standard">	"H-how
do you know? How many little girls have you hit on?"</p><p class="standard">	"Hundreds.
Little girls are the best, 'cause they're dumb and easy to control."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
didn't respond, and she looked away. Yuji wondered if he'd aroused
some latent suspicions. Why else would he be around her? After Butch
Christensen, she was probably wary. Yuji decided to placate her with
the truth. Just once; he didn't intend to make a habit of it. 	</p><p class="standard">	"I
haven't thought about it much. Dating Mariko, I mean. You know I
don't date."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
nodded. "Yes…but maybe now is the time to try."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
rubbed the back of his head and sighed. "Hell, I don't think
it'd even work. Mariko is too bouncy. Her personality and her chest."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
not?" Ai asked innocently.</p><p class="standard">	That
was too unexpected: Yuji had to laugh. "You're petcha-pai."</p><p class="standard">	"Roller."</p><p class="standard">	"Nymphette."</p><p class="standard">	It
was so strange to be exchanging friendly jibes with Ai as if she
weren't the armadillo. Whether or not she was obsessed with dating,
he'd never met a younger girl so able with words.</p><p class="standard">	Ai's
train to the suburbs arrived and the dinner invitation came, but Yuji
realized he didn't want it. He promised another time. When Ai had
gone he sat down to wait for a train in his direction.</p><p class="standard">	He
didn't want to think anymore; he just wanted to get home and rest.
But he couldn't stop the thoughts from coming; his mind opened
Mariko's folder and began to inspect the contents of its own
volition. Knowing Mariko, she'd probably asked to date him for fun.
Yes, that fit her. She'd probably been sitting in her living room,
watching her family's antique TV set, when she realized that
boyfriends were the perfect way to fill up a boring Saturday.  She
was so predictable: fun, food, cover for psychopath friend. 
</p><p class="standard">	And
Arishil. She'd hovered in the back of his thoughts ever since
returning from the Outer Rim. He kept thinking about the way her
hands felt on his shoulders, and the strands of golden hair tickling
his cheeks. He remembered how he'd calmed when she stroked his neck,
how all his anger and sarcasm evaporated, and for a second, her deal
almost sounded good. He'd been stricken the moment he saw her; not
with love, but a powerful fascination. He wanted to see her again.</p><p class="standard">	This
was ridiculous. He could no more be the Irlumarmitpa than he was
Nelson Mandela. Whatever The Sixteen could do as nyvamna, it was
idiotic to put faith in their primitive sun-worshipping voodoo shaman
and his peyote-induced visions. He would go to the ball. Ai would
come, his Carob Esper to protect him, and he'd invite the others too.
They'd talk, and he'd convince Arishil he wasn't interested. That was
the end of it.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	"For
god's sake man, are you nuts?!" Allen screamed.</p><p class="standard">	"Mr.
Amadeus! Be quiet and do <i>not </i>use religious appellations which
might offend those of us with unique spiritual beliefs!" a
passing teacher hissed.</p><p class="standard">	"Yes
sir. Sorry sir," Allen apologized. Once the teacher was gone he
muttered, "I'm Jewish! If I'm not offended, no one else has the
right to be!"</p><p class="standard">	"They're
just looking out for Calamyna Johnson," said Yuji. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Who?"</p><p class="standard">	"The
Neo-Druid. That pasty girl with the freckles and glasses."</p><p class="standard">	"You
mean Bunker Hill."</p><p class="standard">	"If
you're referring to Yumiko Kanzaki, then no."</p><p class="standard">	"In
my defense, how many pasty girls with freckles and glasses are in
this school?"</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
I would expect the coarse brown robe to be a dead giveaway they're
not the same person. I would also expect the large wooden stick which
Calamyna Johnson has a permit to carry to be a clue. Finally, if all
else failed, you might have noticed that Calamyna has dark blonde
hair, while Yumiko's is dark brown."</p><p class="standard">	"Pish."
Allen turned back to his paper container of "rice pilaf"
which resembled a bowl of maggots in rigor mortis. He began to eat.
Yuji couldn't even try to choke down the "rice pilaf", so
he'd thrown his away already. "But man! How could you turn down
McKinley!"</p><p class="standard">	Allen
had called and asked where Yuji ran off to all Saturday. Not willing
to let the truth be known, he finally told Allen that Mariko had
asked him out. It was a crude bait-and-switch maneuver, and it worked
perfectly. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
thought we'd agreed we were switching to cars," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Ferrari,
then! How could you turn down Ferrari? She asked you to ride her like
a naughty mare!"</p><p class="standard">	"She
never said that! She said she wanted to be 'more than friends'. What
the hell does that even mean? Kissy-kissy lovey-dovey boyfriend and
girlfriend? Sex buddies? Platonic lovers? How am I supposed to know?"</p><p class="standard">	"You're
supposed to find out! And even if you get rejected horribly, even if
you get kicked in the jewels—"</p><p class="standard">	"Okay,
stop right there. I can't figure out why you're single, Allen."</p><p class="standard">	"Because
Ferrari and Rolls-Royce—"</p><p class="standard">	"Okay,
stop right there. I know exactly why."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	"Then
you decided what to do about your sister?" said Allen.</p><p class="standard">	They
were sitting under the hawthorn tree. Ai had called on Sunday to
apologize for calling him up to talk about her own problems. He'd
told her not to worry about it. When he'd gone home Saturday night,
Shoko was there, unhurt and fairly cheerful. She'd already ordered
dinner. They'd eaten a civil meal, although there had been an
undercurrent of hostility. Yuji was glad to see she had at least
decided to take his advice and be more careful about their mother.
She was putting in fifty- and sixty-hour work weeks and adding to her
stress was the last thing he wanted to do. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,"
said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"You
decided not to do anything, huh?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah."</p><p class="standard">	"But
if something really bad ever happened, you'd step in."</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah.
You know me."</p><p class="standard">	"Too
well."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
was prettier company than Allen, that was certain, but Yuji was
embarrassed that she now knew so many of his secrets. Of course, he'd
gotten one back in return. Telling him she was an esper was far more
dangerous than he and Mariko revealing their own nyvamna statuses. Of
the three types of nyvamna, chikara-types were regarded as mainly
harmless (except in bar fights and schoolyard scraps), and
magic-users as scary but about as likely to cross an average
civilian's path as a KGB assassin; of the three, espers were the most
highly feared. Their powers made them prone to schizophrenia and
psychosis, and the idea of someone able to read minds was terrifying,
far more than the ability to blow things up, which could be
accomplished with guns and missiles. 
</p><p class="standard">	But
Ai didn't have that ability. She could read emotions. What she
actually read was the chemical buildup in the brain, so she could
also tell when someone was intoxicated. She could transfer emotions
as well; she'd tried to transfer Yumiko's feelings about <i>enjo
kousai </i>into Shoko, but Shoko had broken the connection too soon.
But she couldn't actually read minds. 
</p><p class="standard">	Or
so she said. Personally, Yuji was going to be much more careful what
he thought and felt around her from now on. It wasn't as though he
had anything to hide, but the idea of her knowing everything he
thought was unsettling.</p><p class="standard">	"So,
did I tell you?" he said to Allen.</p><p class="standard">	"Tell
me what?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
got a job."</p><p class="standard">	"A
job? You? No offense man, but I can't imagine you bagging groceries."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
not. I'm working for a software company."</p><p class="standard">	"You?
You don't know anything about computers! How the hell would you—"</p><p class="standard">	"The
company is called Angel Strike."</p><p class="standard">	Allen
stopped. He looked puzzled. He stared at Yuji. Then a grin dawned.</p><p class="standard">	"Aw,
man! You work for an erotic game company!"</p><p class="standard">	"Yep.
I'm a pose illustrator. The writers will send me a picture of a
character and a description of what her expressions and poses should
look like, and I draw them. I work at home; I can either send the
pictures through the mail or ride the train down to Ode and drop them
off."</p><p class="standard">	"How'd
you get a primo job like that?!"</p><p class="standard">	"It's
called talent, Allen."</p><p class="standard">	Allen
laughed. "Yeah, I know you're good, but man, how'd you ever
convince them?"</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
they're a pretty lame company right now. All they do is release
erotic knockoffs of every <i>Crest of Mindalina </i>game that comes
out. But the president of the company is my dad's friend, and he says
they're ready to try something big. He wanted to recruit some new
talent."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
proud of you and everything, man, but you're being underutilized. I
know how good you are. You could be a head design artist!"</p><p class="standard">	"Actually,
the job they gave me is pretty high up for entry-level, but they're a
really small company, so they decided to give me a chance."</p><p class="standard">	"Any
chance I could get hired as Chief Executive of Hotness Control? You
know....I test out the material and make sure it's salty enough?"</p><p class="standard">	"Anytime
I get an order for an erotic scene, I'll let you check over the
concept art before I send it off."</p><p class="standard">	"All
right!"<br />	"Most of what I do is for regular scenes,
though. And I don't make up the ideas for the poses, I just
illustrate them. Still, I'll be making fifty dollars for each
illustration, plus a small royalty on everything they use in the
game, so the money's good and it beats bagging groceries."</p><p class="standard">	
"Listen man, you're gonna need someone to share all that wealth
with, and your good friend Allen will do his best...."</p><p class="standard">	"I
bet you will."</p><p class="standard">	"....but
I can only do so much. So why not date Ferrari? Spread it around."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shook his head. "No. I'm too—"</p><p class="standard">	"Too
Irish," Allen supplied.</p><p class="standard">	"What's
that got to do with it?"<br />	"You Irishmen are all like
that, moping in your grief with your sad songs about dying man-whores
and sinking ships. Ferrari's a good, solid Italian—good food,
good friends, good life."</p><p class="standard">	"Mariko's
Australian."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh.
Well, Ferrari's a good, solid Aussie—good food, good friends, 
</p><p class="standard">good—"</p><p class="standard">	"The
point is," said Yuji, "she wants to date me for fun. It's
likely to be anything but." <i>Plus there's Arishil.</i></p><p class="standard">	"And
my point is," said Allen, "that maybe Ferrari is exactly
what you need to help you—she's got that certain subtle air of
a thistle that could be a rose. More importantly: hot, great
knockers, nice backend, and probably a real acrobat in bed. She's low
maintenance too, the kind of girl you can take down to the pub for
beer and pizza—"</p><p class="standard">	"If
there's a point here, get to it," Yuji interrupted.</p><p class="standard">	"That
is my point! She's a freakin' Ferrari! Even if she is a bit flashy
for everyday use, you can't stop driving her 'cause it just makes you
feel so damn good. Maybe so damn good you can get past this stupid
mental block you have on girls and fun."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
was about to retort and realized he had nothing to say.
"I....actually never thought of it like that. Maybe that's not
such a stupid idea after all."</p><p class="standard">	"See?
See? This is why you need me around. We're like John Travolta and
Sammy L. J. in <i>Pulp Fiction</i>. You da badass, I bring the style
and the class. Yeah!"</p><p class="standard">	"You
say anything like that again, and I'm going to push you into the
river."</p><p class="standard">	The
bell rang. He and Allen separated and went to their classes. Yuji had
health education now; he got his books and entered in a reverie. He
was so wrapped up in his thoughts that he hardly even noticed what
the teacher was handing out until it was thrust in his face. It was a
manila envelope containing a list of colleges in the area, as well as
a bundle of advertising pamphlets.</p><p class="standard">	"While
I'm sure that many of you will chose to continue your public school
education," said the teacher, "you may want to direct your
attention to a few of the private schools in this area. Especially
pay attention to Shinisami Academy in Mizutama and Buona Nuova
Private School in Ode, and Gottslehrer Academy in Nandul."</p><p class="standard">	Nandul
was the Outer Rim grant across the river, and a whisper crossed the
room at its very mention. Only one bridge, in the Ferring Street
area—a tiny strip mall on the extreme northeast of town—crossed
over. Driving into Nandul was allowed, but driving inside it was
illegal. Aside from Central Station, you could only catch a train to
the Outer Rim from there. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Buona
Nuova is a famous business prep school, so if your goals lean towards
corporate work, technology, or finance, you may want to check it out.
Shinisami Academy is a school of the arts. Gottslehrer Academy
provides excellent general education programs, but also provides
programs for those who might wish to become Outer Rim liaisons. Be
advised that each of these three schools will be holding open houses:
1 May for Gottslehrer, 13 May for Buona Nuova, and 8 May for
Shinisami. Well, now that that's out of the way, please put away your
packets and get ready for Health."</p><p class="standard">	As
the teacher droned away about STDs, PCP, and TCB, Yuji found the
flier for Gottslehrer Academy and looked it over. He wasn't remotely
interested in attending, but he assumed this was the site of
Arishil's ball.</p><p class="standard">	Gottslehrer
Academy had programs in Mestaera language, a real elven cook, and
three swimming pools in different shapes. It was the only academy
where uniforms were required. The last page of the pamphlet informed
Yuji that the open house was actually Arishil's ball. It would be
held in the villa of Prince Vanadiel Thaddeus Egwimphron at 123 Pecan
Street off the main thoroughfare. Formal dress required. Celebrities
sure to be present. Yuji wondered if he owned any formal dress while
also puzzling over the cruelty of parents who would name their son
Prince Vanadiel Thaddeus Egwimphron. He was also curious whether the
prince's villa-neighbors at 122 and 124 Pecan Street were people or
brightly colored puppets.</p><p class="standard">	He
managed to make it through Health without absorbing a single scrap of
information on STDs, PCP, or DHD, and when the bell rang he tucked
away the Gottslehrer flier and left the classroom. Next he shared art
with Ai, Mariko, and Allen. Perfect chance to invite them.</p><p class="standard">	The
teacher let them split off and work on their imagined landscapes in
small groups. Every art assignment made Yuji glad he'd bugged his
parents until they paid for art classes. He'd seen self-taught doujin
artists look perfect fools when they slapped Neko-Kijou with her
sword in the center of a few scribbled tufts of grass with a tree
more like a piece of plywood with branches behind her. He'd learned
to draw in art school; he wasn't the most creative, but he could draw
with detail. And without Neko-Kijou.</p><p class="standard">	He,
Ai, Allen, and Mariko sat in a cluster under the window, catching the
light. He watched Mariko and Ai compare work. Mariko was an
indifferent artist. Allen was too obsessed with his lines being
perfectly straight. Ai was fair. She reminded him of William Blake,
with a tilt towards impressionism. She'd told him she drew a little
at home, but never why.</p><p class="standard">	"Man…"
Allen picked up his eraser and pounded it against the paper, stamping
out another line. His tree now covered with eraser dust, he shook off
the paper and tried again. "Yuji…"</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
not doing it for you," said Yuji. He glanced at Mariko's work
upside down. All trees and grass, with a flower or two. Mostly in
proportion, but boring. She'd lost interest; she was discussing Ai's
drawing now.</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji,
what do you think of this?" Ai asked, turning her pad towards
him. Ah, that was Ai. She'd drawn a gloomy forest, with stick-thin
trunks overwhelmed by vines and bramble. It put him in mind of the
forest around the Irpazm Tree. As usual it was skillful, but a bit
stark and two-dimensional. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Add
some shading around the top," he suggested. 
</p><p class="standard">	"That's
what I said, but Mariko…"</p><p class="standard">	"It
won't look storybook if you do that," said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"It
looks too storybook now. In a bad way. Add some shading; it won't
look so amateurish."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
nodded. "Okay."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
sighed. "You just listen to him without question, huh? Poor
girl, she's smitten."</p><p class="standard">	"I-I
am not." She swept her pencil across the page, adding the
shading.</p><p class="standard">	"You
mean older man, toying with an innocent girl's affections," said
Mariko, leaning towards Yuji. "Now you've got her pregnant, man
up! Turn yourself in for statutory rape."</p><p class="standard">	"Why
can't I toy with Rolls-Royce's affections?" Allen whined.</p><p class="standard">	"I
am not pregnant!" Ai declared a bit too loudly. Several eyes
turned on her. She blushed and looked down. "Really, I'm not…"</p><p class="standard">	"Poor
Ai," Yuji commented. He noticed her look up in the corner of his
vision. He focused on his drawing and ignored her. "All alone in
her senior year with an old roller, a gossip hen, and—well,
Allen."</p><p class="standard">	"Please,
Rolls-Royce, don't go to him," Allen pleaded. "He seduces
young girls and lures them to their death by boredom. Three glasses
of whiskey and he'll be neck-deep into his horrible childhood, when
his parents wouldn't let him watch ero-vi."</p><p class="standard">	"Um....why
are you calling me Rolls-Royce?" Ai asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Because
if you were a car, that's what you'd be. Just like if you were a
mountain, you'd be Kilimanjaro."</p><p class="standard">	"Um....why
would I be a Rolls-Royce?"</p><p class="standard">	"Because
you're a classical beauty with an old-world flair. That's right, in
this age of the 300-pound Explorer, bony Prius, and crater-faced
Scion, you are a Rolls-Royce—pretty, smart, charming, and able
to dress totally hot without looking like a kurva. They don't make
'em like you anymore, Rolls-Royce!"</p><p class="standard">	"Er...."</p><p class="standard">	"Mariko,"
said Yuji. He wouldn't let Allen ramble any longer. "Ai and
myself are planning to attend the Gottslehrer Academy ball on the
first of May. Formal dress required, celebrities sure to be present.
Would you be interested in coming as well?"</p><p class="standard">	"Sure."</p><p class="standard">	"Great."</p><p class="standard">	"Damn
line!" Allen swore. "Why won't it go straight?"</p><p class="standard">	"Allen,
look," said Yuji. "Straight lines are bad. No great work is
made of straight lines, just those modern art paintings that use
triangles to represent religious anxiety. Curved lines are natural."</p><p class="standard">	"Curved?
Is a tree curved? Is grass curved?" Allen retorted. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Yes."</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't know what planet you live on!"</p><p class="standard">	"All
right, look. Instead of a tree, we'll draw a snowy landscape."
Yuji turned the page in his sketchbook and began to draw the curves
of a snowy forest. "See?"</p><p class="standard">	Allen
stared at it a moment. "You know, the Eskimos have a hundred
words for snow."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
slapped himself on the forehead.</p><p class="standard">	"Actually,
that isn't true," said Ai. Everyone's gaze went to her, but she
didn't blush or falter. "It isn't as if Inuktitut has a hundred
words that just mean 'snow'. I mean, look at English. It has all
kinds of words that refer to snow—like 'blizzard', 'flurry',
'flake', 'drift'. Look at how many rain words it has—torrent,
downpour, drizzle, mist, shower, spray, sprinkle. If a language only
has one word for everything, the speakers can't express themselves!"</p><p class="standard">	Now
she blushed, faltered, and looked away: the triad. Allen and Mariko
didn't seem to know exactly what had just happened.</p><p class="standard">	"Now
it all makes sense," said Yuji. "You're one of those
Dungeons and Dragons nerds, aren't you?"</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	They
were supposed to meet under the hawthorn tree. Yuji was the first
there. Ai appeared just a minute later.</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji…Um,
I'm going to the arcade with Mariko and Akari…"</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
surprised you're not better at video games, being a Dungeons and
Dragons nerd."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
not really…I mean, I like fantasy a lot, and…making my
own languages…"</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
I thought that was it," said Yuji. "Your drawing style was
too much like Tolkien."</p><p class="standard">	"But
I really want to be a writer. I'm not just doing this to amuse myself
until I can become an accountant."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shrugged. "Makes no difference to me either way."</p><p class="standard">	She
smiled a little. "Well, I was envious. You have a job in art
now, and I was jealous, so I wanted to show off."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
thought a moment. "You know, if you're really any good, I might
be able to find a use for you."</p><p class="standard">	"Doing
what?"</p><p class="standard">	"Writing
erotic games."</p><p class="standard">	She
blushed. "I don't think I can do that…"</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
doujinshi then." He grinned. "I'm just screwing with you.
All ready for the ball?"</p><p class="standard">	She
nodded gravely. "But Yuji, I don't think Arishil will try to
capture you in such a place, so you haven't really got a use for me,
have you?"</p><p class="standard">	"Of
course I do. You're my insurance. Oh, here's Mariko."</p><p class="standard">	"Hey,
ya bastards. Just stopped off to let the office know Yumi's out a few
days."</p><p class="standard">	"How'd
they like that?" Yuji asked, knowing the answer.</p><p class="standard">	"Didn't
much."</p><p class="standard">	"They
get a thousand dollars for every student who shows up," said
Yuji. "If she doesn't show, no money. So, are you ready for the
ball?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
need a new dress, but it's for a college function, so I think I can
get my folks to swing it," Mariko answered. "They despaired
of me going for a while."</p><p class="standard">	"Your
grades go down the toilet?"</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
shook her head. "No."</p><p class="standard">	Enough
time passed that Yuji was about to change the subject, and then Akari
showed up.</p><p class="standard">	"Ren-chan!
Marie-neechan! Ready to go?" she cried. Her nymphettic manner
still annoyed Yuji, but he'd decided that it really wasn't an act;
that was just how she was. "Mr. Watanabe! Are you coming too?"</p><p class="standard">	"No."</p><p class="standard">	"Why
not? Please come! It'll be really fun!"</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
not coming."</p><p class="standard">	"Come,
why don't ya," said Mariko. "If not, you'll just spend the
afternoon brooding somewhere."</p><p class="standard">	"Why
aren't you two all worried about Yumiko? I thought you'd run off to
the hospital straight away."</p><p class="standard">	"Because
we know what happened," said Mariko. "And we made sure
it'll never happen again."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
sure I don't want to know, and I'm extra sure it'll make Ai unable to
ever be a bride, but let's hear it."</p><p class="standard">	"She
slept with a guy," Mariko announced. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
waited for her to elaborate. When she didn't, he laughed. "That's
it? Come on, at least say 'No soap radio!'"</p><p class="standard">	"That's
really what it is, Mr. Watanabe!" Akari protested.</p><p class="standard">	"Did
you have to give Akari the talk about the birds and the bees when you
found this out?"</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
the one who first suspected it!" 
</p><p class="standard">	"In
fact, we know who it was," Mariko added. "Akari, the
evidence."</p><p class="standard">	Akari
produced an RRR football team pin and laid it in Yuji's palm. He
turned it over carefully, perceiving it from every angle, trying to
understand it. The thing was ugly and cheap. That was all he
perceived.</p><p class="standard">	"Hey,
what're you all looking at?" Allen called as he approached. He
leaned over Akari to see what Yuji had. "Oh! Did I forget that
at your house? I knew I lost it somewhere." He swept the pin
from Yuji's hand and dumped it into his pocket. "So, what about
this ball? Am I invited, or is it ladies only?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji's
imagination thrust an unlikely scenario on him, and he looked to
Mariko to disprove it. "Mariko, who did you say it was Yumiko
slept with?"</p><p class="standard">	"Jaime
Vasquez!" Akari's voice joined Mariko's in declaring.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
looked from Allen to Mariko to Yumiko to poor Ai, who had nothing at
all to do with this depravity. <i>It can't be.</i> <i>There's no way
he could've kept it secret. </i>"Allen," he said, "tell
the truth. How did Akari end up with that pin?"</p><p class="standard">	Allen
seemed to notice Akari for the first time. "Oh. Hi. You're
Akari?"</p><p class="standard">	"That's
right. I'm Akari Kanzaki. Yumiko is my neechan."</p><p class="standard">	"Right.
I saw you one time, but never caught your name."</p><p class="standard">	"Allen,"
Mariko added.</p><p class="standard">	"Right,
right. Well, I am sorry to say that I'm bound by an oath of silence.
I can never speak, on pain of castration by nearest available
method."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
okay," said Yuji. "I think I can fill it in. Jolie dumped
you. You came out of it with a cheap football pin that belonged to
Jaime Vasquez. Then we take one psycho, throw in a moment of weakness
and some beer, and pretty soon you're throwing on your clothes and
jumping out the window at three in the morning. But you forgot that
stupid thing. How'd you two hit on Jaime Vasquez?"</p><p class="standard">	"We
asked the entire football team. He was the only one missing a pin,"
said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"He
forgets what he had for breakfast by lunchtime, so he probably forgot
he ever shagged Jolie and never thought to look there for his pin.
The final piece of the story is you two."</p><p class="standard">	"Us?
Where do we fit in, Mr. Watanabe?"</p><p class="standard">	"Allen
and Yumiko both underestimated you. If Allen was eaten by a tiger in
broad daylight walking down Dubovy Drive, I wouldn't give it a second
thought, and Yumiko's mother is probably the same way. Neither of
them thought of nosy, concerned people."</p><p class="standard">	"You
really think I wouldn't tell you if I finally hit it?" Allen
protested. "Come on man—don't you know me?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
do," Yuji replied. "You're much cleverer than most
think—but I'm even cleverer. Where is Yumiko now?"</p><p class="standard">	"At
home, probably," said Akari.</p><p class="standard">	"We're
going. Ai doesn't have to come, but you two are going."</p><p class="standard">	"We
really shouldn't—" Mariko began.</p><p class="standard">	"No,
I'm sick of this. You're the only one who doesn't see it, Mariko—how
she controls everything around her. What she can't manipulate by
sympathy, she wrenches by force. What she can't wrench, she tries to
eject. And when that doesn't work, she tries more extreme
manipulation—like seducing."</p><p class="standard">	"You've
driven me to the edge. Yumiko tried to eject me, but you didn't let
her, so she tried seducing me. Now I'm going to break her."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
seemed ready to argue further. Yuji was sure she would, sure he would
have to coerce her into coming. But she didn't. He could see the
despair in her wilted eyes. She knew everything, and had for a long
time, but she was Yumiko's codependent and powerless to do anything.
Akari's small, balloon-shaped mouth showed her worry, but she also
knew—she was one of those Yumiko ruled by force. And Yuji
himself could do nothing about Arishil, but he could rid himself of
all the strife Yumiko created among his friends: Mariko's concern,
Akari's worry, Ai's fear, could all be swept away.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
came along. Probably she didn't want to be thought of as someone who
runs from a fight. Yuji had seen an ever-so-slight wisp of pride in
her. Allen also came. This was rather shameless, but also rather
brave. Ten minutes' ride to Duso District and a short walk and the
entire troupe was at Yumiko's doorstep. No car meant no mother, Akari
notified them, and also no boyfriend, since he'd left after his
arrest. She let them in.</p><p class="standard">	The
moment the door opened the wracked and groaning wails of a woman in
great distress engulfed them. Yuji led the way towards the sounds,
into the kitchen, with the others following like prisoners to their
executions. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
knelt center-stage on the table, wrapped in the shredded rags of
clothing. Another moan escaped, full of deep passion and dark despair
unleashed. "Oh, Mr. Refrigerator!" she screamed. "How
could you use me and leave me like this? What about our baby? Our
baby, that I murdered!" 
</p><p class="standard">	"What
the hell is she talking about?" muttered Yuji. He realized Allen
had tensed behind him. 
</p><p class="standard">	When
he spoke, Yumiko noticed them. "God!" she screamed.
"They're here to take him! They're here!"</p><p class="standard">	"Who's
here?" Mariko asked. She came forward and tried to take Yumiko's
hand. Yumiko threw herself backward and the table went off balance,
toppling her to the floor. Mariko rushed around to her side. "Yumiko,
what's wrong?"</p><p class="standard">	"She
took something," said Ai.</p><p class="standard">	"What?"
Yuji asked. 
</p><p class="standard">	She
shook her head. "I don't know. Some kind of hallucinogen, I
imagine. And she's drunk rather a lot of alcohol as well."</p><p class="standard">	"Jesus
Christ," said Yuji. "Akari, your cell phone."</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?"
Akari was staring at Yumiko with fascination and fear. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Get
out your damn cell phone and call the hracking police. Hasha nuh!"</p><p class="standard">	Akari
quickly drew her phone from her pocket, fumbled, nearly dropped it,
and finally dialed the number with quivering fingers. "Hello?
Yes. Yes, I'm calling because—because—" She faltered
and looked to Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
seized the phone. "Hello? Yes. I'd like to report a crazed drug
user at the Kanzaki residence, 1948 Dubovy Drive South. Yes, bring
the net guns, tasers, and MP-5s. No, she's not armed. We think it was
hallucinogens. Possibly also some PCP or cocaine. Yes, I know those
are controlled substances, that's why I called you. All right, thank
you." 
</p><p class="standard">	He
hung up the phone and dropped it in his pocket. "If anyone
wondered why the cops couldn't do anything about Miba."</p><p class="standard">	"What's
gonna happen to Oneechan?" Akari asked as she watched Mariko
trying to corner and restrain Yumiko. It reminded Yuji of a video of
Steve Irwin wrestling a crocodile he'd seen a long time ago. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
she'll be—" The refrigerator crashed to the floor and
spilled bottles of beer coated in boxed wine across the linoleum.
Yuji knelt and picked one up, offered it to Ai, and opened it for
himself when she shook her head. "She'll be arrested. Put in
jail for now, without bail I expect. Put on trial. Sent to prison and
probably executed when all's said and done." He took a deep swig
of beer and offered the bottle around again, but both younger girls
refused. Allen took it gratefully, and Yuji opened another for
himself.</p><p class="standard">	"But
that's terrible!" Akari exclaimed. "We can't let that
happen, Mr. Watanabe!"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
I can," said Yuji, "and so can you." He smiled. He was
enjoying this day after all.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	When
the police finally arrived, they wrapped Yumiko in a towel, arrested
her, and took her out to the car. After she had been cuffed and
locked in the back of the car, all three officers present stood
around looking unsure of what to do next. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Anyone
hurt?" one of them finally asked.</p><p class="standard">	"No,
luckily we were able to protect the younger girls from her,"
Yuji replied. He glanced at Mariko, who was staring at Yumiko through
the glass like an orphan staring at a merry Christmas party in some
horrible Christmas special. "She wasn't able to do anything, but
I think she had rape on her mind," he confided in the officer.</p><p class="standard">	The
officer's eyebrows raised. "She say anything like that?"</p><p class="standard">	"Oh
yeah. Well, you saw how she was dressed, or rather not dressed."</p><p class="standard">	"Anything
to add?" the officer asked the others. Ai and Akari shook their
heads. Allen shrank to the back.  "Well, tell ya the truth,
ain't much we can do about this. All we have's your word. No evidence
of any drugs at all."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
decided it would be pushing it to mention the plethora of ways modern
science gave to detect whether someone had used drugs without finding
the drugs or an empty bag that said "DRUGS". "I
understand, Officer," he said. "It's only that she was
frightening the little'uns, you see. We only wanted her under
control. She's really a lovely person, but she's made a few mistakes
recently."</p><p class="standard">	"If
you say so." The cop looked skeptical. Yuji had to control
himself to keep from laughing. "We'll hold her 'til a parent or
guardian comes to get her. She's a minor, and didn't resist arrest,
so there isn't much more we can do."</p><p class="standard">	"Sure.
Thank you, Officer."</p><p class="standard">	The
police carted Yumiko off. Mariko stared after the car while the
others came together into a huddle.</p><p class="standard">	"So,
Allen, I think we'd all like to hear what really happened," said
Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"What
do you mean?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
mean, we've all figured out that you banged her and it somehow drove
her insane—well, more insane than before—leading to
this."</p><p class="standard">	Allen
shook his head. "Man. Okay. I though I could get away with it,
but I guess you guys are too good for me." He took a deep
breath. "This is what happened."</p><p class="standard">	"I
was minding my own business, surfing the net at home, when my cell
phone started ringing. So I looked at the number and it said 'Number
Unknown.' And you know, I don't answer unknown numbers, as it's
probably some guy trying to sell me a bridge, am I right? Sorry."
He'd slipped into his Yiddish accent and Yuji had glared at him.</p><p class="standard">	"Anyway,
it came up again, and again I didn't answer. On the third try I
answered and heard a girl say, 'You're Allen Sternheim, right?' And I
said I was. And she said she wanted hard—"</p><p class="standard">	"I
think it's time for us to go home," said Ai suddenly, putting
her arm around Akari's shoulders.</p><p class="standard">	
"Okay, I'll spare the details. Anyway, she gave me her address
and told me to come over right away, and y'know I wasn't gonna pass
up a chance like that, so I went."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
slapped himself in the forehead. Obviously Allen had never even
thought that sleeping with an anonymous woman who had called him and
told him to come to an unknown address was not the smartest idea in
the world. 
</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
had managed to come out of her orphan-like trance and catch the last
part of what Allen had said, and she evidently didn't like it at all.
"What the hell did you do?" she demanded, grabbing Allen by
the collar of his shirt. "Did you screw her? Deru in her? What
the hell did you—" She looked ready to punch him.</p><p class="standard">	"I
didn't do anything!" Allen yelled. Yuji took Mariko firmly by
the shoulders. He didn't drag her away, but he gave a small squeeze,
and she relented and released Allen.</p><p class="standard">	"Okay.
What happened?" Yuji asked.</p><p class="standard">	"I
went over, right? When she heard the door open she called out, and I
followed her voice downstairs to the room. And she was sitting on the
bed in her underwear, looking pretty damn fine, if I do say so."
Mariko glared at him but did nothing else. Allen swallowed. "We
talked a little bit. I said 'Hey, you're Mariko's friend, aren't
you?' And she said she was. I mentioned what a surprise this was. And
she said 'Well, I just really felt like humping someone 'til he
moaned, and you seemed like a good choice.'"</p><p class="standard">	"I
didn't bother asking why that was—pity sex is still sex,
right?—but I admitted I'd never noticed her much before and
asked if she'd done something new with her hair or makeup. She didn't
answer, just got up and started kissing me, and then she grabbed—"</p><p class="standard">	"Censored,"
said Ai, covering Akari's ears.</p><p class="standard">	"Right.
Anyway, we did it dry for a little bit, and then she said 'Let's do
it for real.' So I got up and took off my shoes, and I'd taken one
sock off when we both heard the door open and somebody come in."</p><p class="standard">	"Who
was it?" Ai asked. Then she blushed. Yuji thought he knew why:
she'd inadvertently revealed her interest in Allen's stupid story.</p><p class="standard">	"It
was her mother and her mother's boyfriend," Allen replied. "We
heard them upstairs, getting it on. Guess Mommy just got back from
bailing out her guy. So Yumiko grabbed me, and damn if she isn't
strong; opened the window; and threw me out into the planter box in
the front, and then she tossed my shoes out after me. But she forgot
that one sock. And then you found it and all this crap went down."</p><p class="standard">	"What
about the pin?" Akari asked.</p><p class="standard">	"It
must've fallen out of my pocket at some point," said Allen with
a shrug. "That can happen when you've got a hand rubbing your—"</p><p class="standard">	"Censored,"
Ai interrupted, covering Akari's ears.</p><p class="standard">	They
all stared at each other in silence for a moment, no one sure what to
do, before Ai spoke again. "Then, does that mean that when
Yumiko was hallucinating, and she talked about an abortion, she was
thinking of what could have happened if you and she had...um,
finished?" She blushed.</p><p class="standard">	"Not
necessarily," said Mariko. "Remember, she went through a
lot, and she might have had one and never told me about it. She
certainly wouldn't have told anyone else."</p><p class="standard">	"But
Akari, you said that your mother's boyfriend left the house after he
was arrested, correct?" Ai asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
he did," said Akari. "I heard them arguing about it once
when I came back. Then they...um...But I was sure he was gone."</p><p class="standard">	"Did
he have a car?" Ai asked.</p><p class="standard">	Akari
shook her head. "No, my mom always drove him everywhere."</p><p class="standard">	"I
think it was probably a different boyfriend," Ai stated. Yuji
didn't think he'd ever heard her state something so unequivocally.</p><p class="standard">	"What
makes you think so?" he asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Yumiko
and Akari's mother is a dedicated party-goer. Akari, didn't you tell
me she's hardly ever up before noon?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah."</p><p class="standard">	"Yumiko's
suicide attempt must have been just after the incident with Allen.
Right? It's the only time her emotions would be high enough to try
something of that sort. Allen, what time would you say you got the
call?"</p><p class="standard">	"What
time? Er...Around eleven, I guess," said Allen.</p><p class="standard">	"I
have a hard time believing that someone as party-hardy as Yumiko and
Akari's mother would be up and about at that time. Yet she was gone
when you came. The 9-0-0 call came in around two-thirty, so she left
again, leaving her boyfriend at the house."</p><p class="standard">	"But
the house was empty when I got there," said Allen. "And
since when are you Meitantei Rolls-Royce, anyway?"</p><p class="standard">	"No,
I want to hear the rest of this," said Yuji. "Go on."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
blushed and nodded. "I think she dropped her boyfriend off
somewhere, then went to pick up her other boyfriend. Since the one
living with her doesn't have a car, he won't suddenly reappear at the
house; she probably arranged to get him when he'd finished what he
needed to do. But until then, she had the house to herself."</p><p class="standard">	"And
what good is any of this?" Mariko demanded suddenly. "How
does it help Yumiko?" She glared at Allen as if it were all his
fault that Yumiko was a complete psychopath. 
</p><p class="standard">	Ai
shrank back and glanced at Yuji. Catching her meaning, Yuji came to
Mariko's side and touched her on the shoulder. "Mariko, it isn't
her fault that any of this happened. And it's not Allen's, either.
But they were both concerned enough to come. So don't be angry at
them. In fact, if there's anyone you should be angry at, it's me. I
just came here to gloat."</p><p class="standard">	"Fine.
Talk," Mariko answered, a bit snappish, and crossed her arms. 
</p><p class="standard">	Ai
continued. "I may be going out on a limb here, but I don't think
she broke down because of Allen. I think it was the other boyfriend,
the secret one. And I think maybe he was the cause of her
abortion...if she had one." She looked around at everyone,
gauging their reactions, and seemed to decide she hadn't concluded
clearly enough, because she added, "Um, that's it." 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
can't think of anyone like that," said Mariko. "And even if
there was, what are the chances he would just happen to be the guy
her mother drags back?"</p><p class="standard">	"How
many man-whores can there be in this city?" Yuji countered.
"It's not a very big city."</p><p class="standard">	"Or
maybe it was intentional," said Allen. "Maybe she knew
Yumiko would react that way to the guy she brought home."</p><p class="standard">	"My
thoughts exactly," said Ai grimly. It was funny to hear her
speak grimly; her voice was more suited to a dark declaration of
"Somebody ate my pudding" than anything with real gravity.</p><p class="standard">	"Okay,
I know we all agree that woman is a terrible mother, but why would
she do that?" Mariko asked. "Did your nice little theory
take that into account?"</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
think about it," said Yuji. "She almost killed herself. If
she'd succeeded, whatever residual parental responsibilities her
mother might have would be gone. And maybe she figured Akari had left
for good."</p><p class="standard">	He
took a look at Akari, who had stayed quiet most of the time. To his
surprise, she didn't look concerned or scared. In fact, her face
looked completely blank, as if she either had no idea what was going
on or had sprinkled barbiturates on her cereal that morning.</p><p class="standard">	"Okay,
you guys can go tear the house up looking for proof of that stupid
theory until the bitch comes back and kicks you out," said
Mariko. "Meanwhile, I'm going to call the bitch and beg her to
go get her daughter out of jail, since you so <i>kindly </i>called
the police on my best friend." She stomped off down the sidewalk
to use her cell phone. Yuji glanced around to see if anyone was
planning to go with her, but nobody seemed willing to brave her rage.

</p><p class="standard">	"Shall
we tear up the house, then?" he asked them all, again in a
cheeky, cheery London accent. They all stood there looking rather
stupid until Ai looked up at him and nodded. Yuji nodded back, and
they led the way back to the house, with Allen and Akari following. 
</p><p class="standard">	The
kitchen floor was still scattered with bottles of beer and sticky
with boxed wine. Ai instinctively took a towel from next to the sink
and began to mop up the mess, careful to keep the edge of her skirt
from trailing in it. Allen looked around vaguely, his gaze falling at
last on Yuji. "What are we looking for?"
he asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Anything
that proves Ai's theory of a different man-whore. Akari, do you think
you can tell the difference between clothes that belong to the guy
who was living here and ones that belong to someone else."</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
leave it to me!" said Akari. "I'll prove Ren-chan's theory
for sure!"</p><p class="standard">	"Also
any jewelry or trinkets. Remember, all this started with a football
pin. Does that sound about right, Armadillo Girl?"</p><p class="standard">	"Hmm?"
Ai looked up from her housework. "Oh, yes. Yes, go ahead and
start looking. I'll just finish up with this..."</p><p class="standard">	"All
right. Akari, you take Mom's bedroom, it's the most likely to have
something. Allen, you take the living room, and you join him when
you're ready, AG. I'll take Yumiko's bedroom."</p><p class="standard">	He
watched Akari and Allen follow his orders and then went himself down
to Yumiko's room. When he entered he saw that it was divided in half
with a curtain. One half was fully set up with a dresser and desk,
while the other half was filled with boxes and suitcases and had
manga lying on the bed. So Yumiko and Akari shared this room. It
didn't seem large enough for two people to share, and Yuji was sure
this place had more than two bedrooms, unless the walls were padded
with triple layers of Sheetrock. 
</p><p class="standard">	He
began to snoop around Yumiko's side, turning over the mass of junk
she'd apparently left scattered everywhere during her acid trip. He
was disappointed not to find blotter paper or any other evidence of
illegal drugs, and the rest was simply Yumiko's own pile of trash:
old clothes, dog-eared romance novels, empty lipsticks, used jars of
face cream and blush, tarnished silver jewelry, cell phones with no
service, MP3 players with dead
batteries, and broken
eyeliner pencils. 
</p><p class="standard">	That
heap sifted through, he moved to the closet, which was on Akari's
side. He didn't really expect to find anything in here; if Ai's
theory was correct, Yumiko had been in here with Allen when Bitch
Mommy and the other man came home. He'd given the others the rooms
where something might turn up, because Akari would recognize evidence
if she found it and he trusted the other two to know it better than
he would. But he went into the closet and turned over a pile of
jackets and a spilled tub of Lite-Brite pegs, and underneath it he
found a tiger-striped handbag.</p><p class="standard">	It
seemed to be leather, orange and bumpy like a basketball, but crossed
with black stripes. Yuji picked it up and found that it had tissue
paper inside, as if it had just been purchased, though it had lain
under a mountain of debris at least
a few months in the making. 
</p><p class="standard">	He
took the bag and went into the hallway, past the laundry room and
towards the living room, where Allen and Ai were searching. He found
them inside, puzzling over some artifact he couldn't see clearly from
the doorway. He moved closer and saw that it was a necklace, a gold
chain attached to a diamond pendant.</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
hey Yuji. We figure this was a gift from the other man," said
Allen. "It's real twenty-four carat gold and diamond. The
live-in boyfriend didn't have a car or a house, so he probably
couldn't afford something like this."</p><p class="standard">	"Or
she bought it for herself," said Ai. She held up a velvet-lined
box with a tag inside. "This tag says it's a birthstone
necklace. That means her birthday is in April. But I don't think this
man would know that sort of thing, do you?"</p><p class="standard">	"Maybe
he didn't read that and it was just a coincidence that he bought it,"
Allen countered.</p><p class="standard">	"I
found something," said Yuji, cutting Allen off. He handed Ai the
bag. 
</p><p class="standard">	"A
handbag?"</p><p class="standard">	"Tiger-striped."</p><p class="standard">	"What's
that mean?" Allen asked.</p><p class="standard">	"It
means Yumiko got her tiger-striped handbag, even if La Tirelire
doesn't carry them. Can either of you make out anything about it?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't know handbags," said Ai. Her ears turned red. "I...carry
one from K-Mart," she confessed.</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
no shame in a good synthetic leather K-Mart handbag," said
Allen, running his hands over the tiger stripes. "Looks like a
low-end one from Les Joujoux à la Femmes. Of course, 'low-end'
is relative—we're talking fifty or sixty bucks here." Yuji
and Ai both stared at him. "What? I learned so I could impress
girls with my fashion sense."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
not impressed," said Ai.</p><p class="standard">	"Keep
talking, Miss K-Mart bag." Allen took the bag from Ai, turned it
over, and looked inside. "Never been used."</p><p class="standard">	"I
found it in the closet under a year's worth of crap," said Yuji.
"She got this a while ago, I'd say. And for what it's worth, she
did tell me a story about an abortion when I was at the
hospital—though she made it sound like it happened recently."</p><p class="standard">	"So
it may be that something of the sort really did happen," Ai
mused. 
</p><p class="standard">	"But
we still don't have any evidence for the other man," said Allen.</p><p class="standard">	"It
looks like Akari and Yumiko were sharing a room, although this place
seems big enough for three
bedrooms. Ai, will you come with me to look for it?"
Yuji said.</p><p class="standard">	"Sure."</p><p class="standard">	"And
Allen, keep looking in here."</p><p class="standard">	"Righty-o,
Inspector!" Allen set the handbag on the sofa and began to
search again, looking under the armchair. Ai followed Yuji up the
stairs to the main corridor.</p><p class="standard">	"The
boyfriend was probably staying in the other bedroom," said Ai.</p><p class="standard">	"Why
would Mommy Dearest put her lover in a separate room?"</p><p class="standard">	"From
the look of this house, she likes to have nice things: the necklace,
the mantlepiece, the sofa. But the boyfriend is young, isn't he?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't know."</p><p class="standard">	"I
think Akari told me he's in his mid-twenties. He probably wanted to
have things that she didn't want in her room."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
nodded. "That makes sense. Like Playboy posters and marijuana
roaches and things."</p><p class="standard">	They
passed the master bedroom, where Akari had spread the dirty laundry
all over the bed, to the next door, which Yuji had taken for storage
the first time through. It seemed Ai had been right; the moment Yuji
opened the door he smelled the scent of burnt Colombian herbal
supplement administered by pipe, along with body odor and semen.
Sheets had been hung over the windows to filter out the light,
keeping the room at a permanent twilight. Over the elegant wallpaper
were posters of rappers and young ladies who were definitely not
employed by a major fast-food chain, even though they wore part of
its uniform. The bed at the right end of the room was a mess, with
blankets all over the floor; it faced a huge wall-mounted plasma TV,
which overlooked a tangle of cords that led to video game consoles
and a pile of what Yuji hoped were balloons that someone had tried to
fill with the crème at the center of Twinkies.</p><p class="standard">	He
noticed Ai wrinkle her nose as they entered, and he didn't blame her.
"If you want to go back to the living room, it's all right. I
can look this over myself."</p><p class="standard">	"No,
it's not a problem. I'll help you." Nevertheless, she kept
looking around with distaste.</p><p class="standard">	"Okay,
um, why don't you search the dresser, and I'll look under the bed?"
Yuji suggested, trying to give her the less disgusting job.</p><p class="standard">	She
nodded and went to work. Yuji knelt down to check under the bed,
which he noticed had an oak
frame that was much nicer than his bed's metal frame. He immediately
noticed several rubber objects that he didn't want Ai to see, since
they would frighten her enough even if she wasn't aware that one was
meant to shove them into a bodily orifice, as well as a box of videos
with titles like 'Whorrential Downpour Doxies 19' and 'Angels and
Dildos 42'. If only they had a DNA testing lab; they could use the
sperm light to see if any of those things had been used and find out
who had been using them. There was also a stack of paperwork from the
Welfare Office; Yuji pulled this out and saw the name 'Josh Braff'
next to the age '21' and the employment status 'Unemployed'. It
seemed the guy was a professional carioca, somebody who lived off the
charity of whatever women he could seduce with his looks and charm. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shoved it back in and sat back on his thighs and felt something press
against his leg. He reached into his pocket and found that he still
had Akari's cell phone. He'd dropped it into his pocket without
really thinking after making the police call. He noticed that the
'Missed Call' indicator was on. He went into the Missed Calls list
and saw that the most recent was from KAZUKO MATSUTAKI while the
second was from EUTSLER M. He had no idea who either of this people
were or why they would be trying to call Akari. He moved down the
list and saw no more from KAZUKO MATSUTAKI  but one other call from
EUTSLER M. from 3:02 on the day Yumiko had been taken to the
hospital. Just before it was a call from ONEECHAN at 2:50.</p><p class="standard">	"Look
at this," he said, showing the phone records to Ai. She stared
at them for a minute, confused. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Who
is Eutsler M.?" she asked. "I've never heard Akari talk
about anyone like that."</p><p class="standard">	"Me
neither," said Yuji. 
</p><p class="standard">	At
that moment the front door opened, and both of them tensed, thinking
it was Yumiko's mother, until Mariko's voice called out, "You
guys aren't really looking for clues in here, are you?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
led the way back into the kitchen, where Mariko was sitting at the
table looking a bit less irked. "Actually, we've found a
couple," he said. He told Mariko about the handbag.</p><p class="standard">	"All
that means is she didn't lie," said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"No,
it means she <i>did </i>lie,"
Yuji corrected. "She got her handbag, just not from La
Tirelire."</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
so what? A bag from Les Joujoux isn't on the same level as one from
La Tirelire no matter how you slice it," said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
at the hospital, she told me an old guy had gotten her pregnant and
promised to buy her the bag
because she had an abortion to save his marriage. Can you think of
anyone like that?" Yuji persisted.</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
sighed. "I think something like that did happen, but I never
heard anything about an abortion," she said. 
</p><p class="standard">	"How
long ago was that?"</p><p class="standard">	"About
a year ago, I guess."</p><p class="standard">	"Does
this phone record mean anything to you?" Ai asked, handing
Akari's phone to Mariko. Mariko scanned the list and shook her head.</p><p class="standard">	"Kazuko
Matsutaki is their mother. She goes by Kanzaki now because the money
is legally tied to that name: she has access to it as long as she's
taking care of the children of the Kanzaki family. Eutsler M. means
nothing to me. Where did this come from? Is this one of Yumiko's old
phones?"</p><p class="standard">	"It's
Akari's," said Ai.</p><p class="standard">	"Akari?
That's strange, I didn't think she knew anything about their mother
going by her maiden name. Maybe Yumiko entered it for her..."
Mariko drifted off. "Anyway, it doesn't matter. I persuaded the
bitch to get Yumiko out by reminding her of a few things...like if
Yumiko and Akari get taken by the puppers<a href="#sdendnote1sym" name="sdendnote1anc" class="sdendnoteanc"><sup>i</sup></a>,
her money is cut off. You can all stop this stupid search and go
home."</p><p class="standard">	"What
if only Yumiko were gone, but Akari were still here?" Ai asked.
"Would she still be getting the money?"</p><p class="standard">	"Guess
so," Mariko answered wearily. "Look, give it up, would you?
As long as Yumiko's safe, I don't care what exactly drove her to
almost sleep with Allen."</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
I do," said Yuji. 
</p><p class="standard">	"You
can just go home and get drunk, because you're not going to laugh at
us anymore. I like you, but Yumiko's my old friend, and if one of you
has to go, it's not much of a choice for me."</p><p class="standard">	"Let
us search a few minutes more, please," said Ai. "Please?
We'll leave in a moment."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
sighed. "You're not gonna find anything. But since you asked so
nicely, go ahead."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
took Yuji by the arm and gently led him back to the boyfriend's room.
She had to reach up a bit to get his arm, but Yuji still had to admit
he liked the feel of her skin on his. He also liked the side of her
he'd seen during this incident: watching her deduct things was like
reading a Sherlock Holmes book, if Sherlock Holmes were a
five-foot-tall powder puff. At this moment, he felt much
closer to her than to Mariko, who had shown just how bad she could be
about defending her psychotic
friend.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
closed the door after them, but this proved to be a mistake; without
the airflow, the stench of the room was stifling. She tried to take
the sheet off the window, but couldn't quite reach the tacks holding
it in; Yuji took them out for her and pulled open the recalcitrant
window, releasing a cloud of dust along with it.</p><p class="standard">	
"Yuji, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
think so, Brain, but if yogurt came in gallon jugs, would we get milk
out of a pump station like gasoline, or out of a hydrant?"</p><p class="standard">	"Please
be serious."</p><p class="standard">	"Okay.
I seriously think that Mommy somehow found out about the whole
incident and then tracked down the guy and brought him over just to
screw with her psycho daughter."</p><p class="standard">	"Really?
I guess you weren't thinking what I was."</p><p class="standard">	"No,"
Yuji agreed, "I wasn't pondering what you were pondering."</p><p class="standard">	"Let's
go find Akari."</p><p class="standard">	Akari
was still in the next room, sifting through the laundry from her
mother's hamper. Allen had joined her; he seemed to be relishing that
most of it was silk bras and panties and shear negligées. When
they came in, he looked up. "Hey, Yuji, K-Mart Handbag. Find
anything in the other room?"</p><p class="standard">	Ai
was blushing as usual. "Um, no, it looked a lot like your room
probably does, Allen."</p><p class="standard">	"What's
that supposed to mean?"</p><p class="standard">	"AG
thinks she knows who's under the rubber mask," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"You
do? Let's hear it," said Allen. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Tell
it in order and give us all the details," said Yuji, "because
if you figured something out that I didn't, I must've missed
something." 
</p><p class="standard">	"All
right. Yuji, Akari, you remember that at the hospital I gave my
theory that the tiger-striped handbag was real. It appeared in all
the stories Yumiko gave us for why she had tried to end her life. I
said then that if we could get her cell phone, we could find out
whether she'd started doing enjou kousai again, but the fact that she
called Allen makes me think she hadn't."</p><p class="standard">	"Sleeping
with him wouldn't be different from sleeping with some old guy,"
Yuji supplied. Allen looked hurt, but said nothing.</p><p class="standard">	"Right.
But if you recall, one of her stories was also that her mother's
boyfriend had attacked her. At the time it seemed like an obvious
claim, since he was already
being investigated by the police. But from what we've seen here, it
doesn't seem that he was the
type to do anything to her. He only wanted to live off her mother as
long as he could. And he only appeared in one story, while the
handbag appeared in two."</p><p class="standard">	"Mariko
says that about a year ago, Yumiko may have gotten a tiger-striped
handbag that wasn't to her liking from a man as a gift for covering
up for him and saving his marriage. Yumiko herself claimed that she
recently had an abortion, but the doctors didn't find any evidence of
that, did they?"</p><p class="standard">	"No,
nothing on the chart, anyway," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"But
it could have happened a year ago. And if, all of a sudden, the man
who was involved in such an event reappeared as her mother's lover,
it might have a bad effect on her mind."</p><p class="standard">	"That
just brings us back to the beginning, though," said Allen. "Was
it a coincidence, or did she do it intentionally? And if it was
intentional, why?"</p><p class="standard">	"Someone
did it intentionally," Ai replied. "And before we started
searching, I would have assumed it was Yumiko's mother. After all, it
isn't implausible that neglect could turn into outright abuse. Maybe
her mother wasn't satisfied with something and needed an outlet. But
now I think someone else was responsible."</p><p class="standard">	"Who?"
Akari asked.</p><p class="standard">	"You,"
said Ai.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
and Allen both shifted their gazes from Ai to Akari, who was staring
blankly at Ai's face, a small grin around her mouth. "Her?"
said Allen. "How? Why?"</p><p class="standard">	"Where?
What? Who?" Yuji completed for him.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
looked away from Akari's blank stare at the collection of silk and
rayon nightwear on the bed. "Revenge. Yumiko yelled at you and
threw money at you. It was the same treatment she endured as a child.
But you weren't used to it, and you didn't like it at all."</p><p class="standard">	"How
did she know about any of this?" Yuji asked, now not so sure of
Ai's deductive abilities. "How did she know about this man?"</p><p class="standard">	"As
to how she first found out, I can't say. Maybe Yumiko told her. Maybe
 she contacted the teleclub for a list of men who had received
Yumiko's phone number. But once she did know, it was easy for her to
find the number. You told me that Yumiko keeps all of her old cell
phones, Akari. That she had at least five or six of them."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
right," said Yuji. "They were all over the floor when I
looked in there."</p><p class="standard">	"All
she had to do was start one of them and look at the call history,"
Ai continued. "She could find out who had been calling a lot
around that time and get the rest of his information from the
contacts list. Then she could call him and have him meet her mother
someplace where her mother goes a lot. Once he'd seduced Ms. Kanzaki,
she probably couldn't wait to get him into the house. She waited for
a time when she could get her live-in boyfriend out and brought him
by so they could enjoy some time together."</p><p class="standard">	"But
all the teleclub guys are old men," said Yuji. "Captain
Marvelous in the next room is only twenty-one. Why would she trade
him for some old guy?"</p><p class="standard">	"He
probably said 'Why, hello there, young lady. Shouldn't you be in
school?' or something stupid like that," said Allen. "Old
women eat that up." When he saw everyone staring at him, he
shrugged. "What? I flatter an older lady every once in a while.
I'm not ageist or anything, you know."</p><p class="standard">	"Okay,
Allen's love life aside, how could Akari know what kind of effect
that would have on Yumiko?" asked Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"She
probably didn't know for sure. But I bet she knew it would hurt
Yumiko. She must have known how much Yumiko despised her old life and
how glad she was to have left it behind," said Ai. 
</p><p class="standard">	Akari
continued to stare blankly, mostly at Ai, but also giving looks to
Yuji and Allen. "I didn't do it," she said at last. "I'm
not capable of something like that, Mr. Watanabe. For one thing, if I
called him, how would he know what Mom looked like?"</p><p class="standard">	"You
could've sent him this," said Ai, holding up Akari's cell phone.
There was a picture of an attractive woman in a white blazer and
skirt on the screen. She was much older and curvier than either
Yumiko or Akari, but her hair was the same rich chestnut brown as
Akari's, fell in the same graceful ripples, and her eyes had the same
steely look in them that Yumiko's did when she was sniping at Yuji.
She was sitting at the kitchen table with a glass of wine, facing
away from the camera, as if the picture had been taken by someone
leaning around the corner. "There's no copy of the actual email
on this phone, but this picture of a mother you hate is rather nice
proof, I think."</p><p class="standard">	"I-I
don't hate her," Akari insisted. "She scares me, but—"</p><p class="standard">	"You
haven't felt anything for anyone one way or another this entire
time," said Ai. "Your face has been completely flat."
Yuji knew that this declaration rested on something a little more
solid than faces: esper powers. "And I'm sure if we look through
Yumiko's old phones, we'll find that about a year ago she started
having a lot of contact with Eutsler M.," Ai went on. "As
to what actually happened
back then, I can't say. Perhaps she told the truth. Perhaps not. But
I would guess that whatever she was feeling was amplified by the drug
she took. A hallucinogen's effect depends on the setting in which
it's taken. If the person taking it feels depressed and afraid, the
drug will mirror that. It may even make the person depressed enough
to attempt suicide."</p><p class="standard">	Ai,
Yuji, and Allen all watched Akari, waiting for her to answer the
charges somehow. As farfetched as Yuji thought Ai's theory was, it
did make sense. He could certainly understand why Akari would want to
hurt Yumiko.</p><p class="standard">	Akari's
face remained vacuous for a moment, then she began to smile. It was a
rigid smile, more like she was just pulling her mouth up at both ends
and showing her teeth, that left her eyes touched only by the same
steely look they'd seen in her mother's picture a moment ago. "You're
good, Ren-chan. Maybe I did do it. Maybe I pretended to be pregnant
and sweet-talked all the abortion doctors into telling me if Yumiko
Kanzaki had ever been through, until I found out where she'd gone.
Maybe I even made the LSD for her. But even if I did, what are you
going to do about it? I didn't do anything illegal."</p><p class="standard">	"No,"
said Ai, "you didn't. Unless you really did make the LSD, and I
don't believe that. But I believe with all my heart that you did it,
Akari. And I'm going to leave it up to Yuji to decide what to do
about it."</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?"
Three noises of shock—from Akari, Allen, and Yuji
himself—filled the room at the same time. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
think what you did was wrong, Akari. But I want to believe that you
didn't know what would happen. There are so many different issues to
consider and so many different possible decisions. And I trust Yuji
to choose the right one."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
nice job, pushing this all on me," said Yuji with a sigh.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
blushed. "I'm sorry. I thought you would make a good decision."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
sighed again and shook his head. "Okay. This is my decision, and
I don't know if it's good or not, but I want all of you to swear to
abide by it. Allen, Akari, Ai—all of you swear. And the penalty
for breaking this oath is a three-day marathon of every Angel Strike
game ever released, including the one with the dragon scene."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
looked horrified at that penalty, while Allen seemed to be pondering
whether he should break the oath just to get his hands on every Angel
Strike game ever released, especially the one with the dragon scene.
Akari just stared at him, that fixed grin daring him to turn her in. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
think we should leave it all alone."</p><p class="standard">	He'd
expected Ai to be dissatisfied, but to his surprise, that didn't seem
to be the case. It was more like this was the answer she'd been
looking for all along, but she couldn't betray her own instincts by
proposing it, so she'd left it to him to do it. And, also to his
surprise, he didn't have a problem with that. He preferred to do it
rather than let Ai compromise herself.</p><p class="standard">	Akari's
face suddenly became adorably puzzled: her eyes got wide, her mouth
got small, and her head tilted. "Why? If you really think I did
something wrong, why wouldn't you tell someone?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
think Yumiko did it all to herself. And I think it doesn't matter to
me. I just want everything to be how it was. I want to forget that
this happened. Can you do that?"</p><p class="standard">	He
saw Akari's eyes moistening just before she pulled out the ultimate
trick in her bag of nymphettic whiles, and sprang at him, grabbing
him around the middle. "Mr. Watanabe!"</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
praise my moral bankruptcy," said Yuji. "No one hears about
this, not even Mariko. Can you guys do that?"</p><p class="standard">	Allen
nodded. Ai hesitated before also nodding. Yuji nodded back, and the
four of them returned to the kitchen, where Mariko was sitting with a
can of beer from the refrigerator. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
now that you guys are done with your pointless search, can we please
get out of here?" she said.</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah.
This was a waste of time, like you told us," said Yuji. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Glad
you agree."</p><p class="standard">	They
stepped outside and had gone downstairs to the sidewalk when a white
two-door hybrid-electric Toyota Priapus came speeding up the road and
screeched to a sudden halt next to the curb. The door opened, and out
stepped the woman from the photo on Akari's cell phone. Today she was
wearing a scarlet blouse and black skirt, but otherwise she looked
identical to the photo. Her lip was curled in chagrin as she stared
at the five of them.</p><p class="standard">	"Akari!"
she called. "My little girl! Thank god you weren't hurt!"</p><p class="standard">	"Mom!
Mom, I was scared!" Then Akari ran to her and the woman snapped
the girl up in her arms, embracing her as Yuji never would've
imagined she could from all he'd heard about her. "I was scared
of Oneechan, I thought she'd hurt me—"</p><p class="standard">	"No,
no, I wouldn't let her do that!" Akari's mother insisted,
stroking her daughter's hair.</p><p class="standard">	"Mommy!"</p><p class="standard">	"My
daughter, my little girl!"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji,
Ai, and Allen were all staring at this spectacle, but Mariko, looking
miffed, had already stomped off to find her way home. Allen shook his
head and left as well, leaving Yuji and Ai together.</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
then I guess you won't be needing to stay with me tonight..." Ai
mumbled. Given their distance and the amount of squealing they were
doing, Yuji doubted Akari could hear her. He set off in the direction
Mariko had gone, and Ai followed him.</p><p class="standard">	"Do
you suppose Akari knew this would happen too?" Ai asked when
they were a few blocks away.</p><p class="standard">	"Maybe.
But I meant what I said: I don't care, and I'm not going to waste
time thinking about it. I suggest you do the same."</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
you're right. It really is a waste of time for me to worry about
this," Ai agreed. "I sensed something strange about Akari."</p><p class="standard">	"That
she's more devious than we gave her credit for? Yeah, I got that
too," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
shook her head, her strawberry-blonde hair whirling about her face.
"No, not that. Until now, the emotions she feels have always
matched very closely the emotions she displays. But today it almost
seemed as if she were feeling two separate emotions at once, and not
in logical combinations. It felt as if I were reading two separate
people."</p><p class="standard">	"Maybe
Allen or I was interfering," Yuji suggested.</p><p class="standard">	"No,
I thought so at first too, so I tried to find your emotions so that I
could compare them. All four signals were distinct."</p><p class="standard">	"Weird
as that may be, I think you shouldn't concern yourself too much with
it," said Yuji. "After all, we've got a ball to go to, so
you'd better decide whether you want to take me, Allen, or Mariko, or
go single."</p><p class="standard">	Her
entire face turned red and she looked away from him, her hands folded
in front of her. Yuji enjoyed getting this reaction out of her.
"Go...well, I had thought a little...I don't want to go alone,
but I don't want Allen to take me, and...and I wasn't sure you were
willing to do something like this for me...or whether you were going
with Mariko..."</p><p class="standard">	"I
have no reason to go except to get Arishil off my back," said
Yuji. "As for Mariko, I don't think she's very happy with me
right now. If you want to come with me, you're welcome. We don't have
to dance or anything."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh...good...I've
never actually been to a dance..."</p><p class="standard">	"Me
neither. Never cared."</p><p class="standard">	They
walked in silence for a moment, eventually coming up to the bus stop
where Mariko was waiting.

      <div class="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard">	A
hand opened the embroidered silk curtain and its mate motioned for
someone else to precede the pair's owner onto the balcony. The
perfect white beech terrace overlooked a beautiful garden, planted
with hydrangea and roses, on its right. On its left it overlooked a
dark alley where the servants hid the trashcans around the corner in
order to keep them out of sight. Yuji was currently huddled up
against one of these trashcans, hoping he'd managed to lose whoever
was following him by pretending to visit the restroom, then doubling
back to the sitting room, winding his way through the garden, and
jumping the fence into the alley. He looked himself over and saw that
his tuxedo seemed to have borne all this without taking any damage,
which was good, because he didn't want to have Arishil's accountant
sending him bills for the rental saying he'd gone beyond the bounds
of reasonable wear and tear.</p><p class="standard">	From
his vantage point among the trashcans, Yuji could see the balcony
perfectly, but since this side of the garden wasn't lit, he figured
he was probably invisible to whoever was up there. If he was lucky,
whoever had been tailing him  had given up and gone to load up on
canapés at the prince's catered dance in the hall. If he were
slightly less lucky, the person would follow him into the alley,
where he'd have the chance to ask some emphatic questions. With his
fist.</p><p class="standard">	However,
these two people on the balcony could prove troublesome for that end.
One of them, judging by the hem of a gown that flapped past the
curtain, was a woman. She seemed reluctant to go out on the balcony,
which led Yuji to think the one inviting her was a man with something
specific in mind. He decided as long as there was no sign of his
pursuer, he'd eavesdrop on them. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Please,
I beg you. I pray thee accompany me to the balcony, and there let us
speak of many things," said the pretentious voice of the prince.
<i>Of shoes, and ships, and sailing wax, and cabbages, and kings,
</i>Yuji added for him. He hoped the
girl would resist this entreaty; if the prince got her onto that
balcony, he would probably gobble her just as surely as the Walrus
and Carpenter had gobbled those oysters. In her oyster. He would have
sex with her.</p><p class="standard">	The
door from the kitchen opened, and from the corner of his eye Yuji saw
someone dressed like a server. He was just wondering if this was the
person following him and whether he should start running when he felt
a hand on his left shoulder and jumped up, knocking over the cans and
twisting out of the grasp of the person who'd flanked him. 
</p><p class="standard">	"You're
trapped," the man in the server's uniform told him. Yuji glanced
at the server, and then at the one who'd flanked him. The latter
seemed considerably more menacing; even though he was dressed like a
high school student trying to attend a high-class party on a very
small budget, and had a mess of curls puffing up from his head like a
male Shirley Temple, he was also carrying a switchblade, which he
pointed at Yuji, the blade gleaming in the light from the garden.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
took a moment to look at the one in the server's uniform and realized
he'd been wrong: this one really was scarier. Because he recognized
that bulky frame, balding head, and scraggly beard. They belonged to
someone the Sakura police had obviously not had the competence to
keep locked up.</p><p class="standard">	"Trapped
like Tupac, eh Watanabe?" the one who'd flanked him said,
stroking the switchblade with his index finger.</p><p class="standard">	Then
movement on the balcony caught Yuji's eye. It seemed the prince had
finally convinced his oyster to take a walk with him. And even from
here, there was no mistaking that strawberry-blonde hair, or the
conservative cut of the evening gown the oyster had been wrapped in
for shipping. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Thug
life," Yuji remarked, without really knowing why.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	"So,
the nymphette's not staying with Rolls-Royce anymore?" Allen
asked.</p><p class="standard">	"For
now, she's back at her mother's, but I got the impression that won't
last for long," Yuji replied. They were sitting in the rest area
of the arcade, school over, drinking canned coffee and watching
people waste their lives playing video games in between wasting their
own. "It'll probably take one of those cycles Mariko was talking
about before she's back at Ai's whining about how mean her mother
is."</p><p class="standard">	"By
the way, what you said about every Angel Strike game...including the
one with the dragon scene..."</p><p class="standard">	"I
was bluffing. I can't get them for you."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh."</p><p class="standard">	Allen
stopped to finish his coffee before he spoke again. "So, is
there some reason you're going to this Gottslehrer Academy ball? It
doesn't seem like your thing at all."</p><p class="standard">	"There's
a very, very good reason for it," said Yuji. "But you're
not going to know what it is until after the ball."</p><p class="standard">	"What?
Oh man, tell me!"</p><p class="standard">	"I
can't. Trust me, it's very delicate information."</p><p class="standard">	"Better
be more delicate than a virgin's nipple for me to be going through
this with you without even knowing why."</p><p class="standard">	"Trust
me." Yuji tossed the empty can at the recycling bin and missed.
He got up and threw it away by hand. "And besides, the upshot
is, you're getting a ride to a ball filled with college girls out of
this, so don't worry too much about my reasons for doing it."</p><p class="standard">	"It's
just all so weird," said Allen. "You're doing this for a
teacher, man! The enemy!"</p><p class="standard">	"I
thought girls were the enemy."</p><p class="standard">	"Girls
are just the guardians of the greatest treasure on the earth. They've
got to make sure only the worthy make it through their golden gates.
Teachers, on the other hand, have no excuse for being such bastards."</p><p class="standard">	"I
can't say I'm happy about this either, but he said there was no other
way to do it."</p><p class="standard">	Allen
tossed his empty can of coffee at the recycling bin and also missed.
He got up and threw it in. "So there's no way at all he can get
another one of this stupid card? Can't just buy another one
somewhere?"</p><p class="standard">	"Apparently
his son won the card at a tournament and only three were given out,
so no, unless he can convince one of the other two to sell, which
would probably cost his son's college fund and his own retirement
fund, there's no way to get another one," Yuji replied. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Okay,
but if these guys stole the card, no way they'll just give it to us.
What've we got in case things get ugly?"</p><p class="standard">	"Fists
and sharp wit," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Man!
We need at least a couple of baseball bats or something. I mean,
maybe you're fine, but I'm just a mere mortal. If these guys are big
enough, I'm gonna get creamed."</p><p class="standard">	"You
get yourself creamed every time you watch <i>Cleopatra </i>on
TV, so you should be used to it by now."</p><p class="standard">	"You're
not gonna tell me you don't find Elizabeth Taylor hot in that movie!
Don't even try!"</p><p class="standard">	"I
really don't."</p><p class="standard">	"Then
how did you draw such a good doujin about her?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
can draw doujin without caring at all about the subject matter. I
could probably draw a doujin of Phyllis Diller if some ass paid me
to."</p><p class="standard">	Allen
didn't speak for a second, letting that sink in. He had apparently
decided to drop the subject, since his next words were, "Know
what they call manga in France?"</p><p class="standard">	"They
don't call them manga, like in America?"</p><p class="standard">	"Nah,
man, they've got froggy throats, they can't say something like
'manga'. They call them
<i>bandes-desinées</i>."</p><p class="standard">	"How
do you know that?"</p><p class="standard">	"My
dad studied in France for a year when he was in college. They had all
the old manga when he was there, same as we did: Sinful City, Buruma
Seed, BioGems, Tokyo Ziggurat."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh
yeah. All those old series with the demon rape."</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
yeah. Only they have French names for all of them. Tokyo Ziggurat was
<i>La Torre à Tokyo</i>.
Pretty much describes anything ever written by MASH. Sinful City was
called <i>La Ville en Inferne</i>."</p><p class="standard">	"What
about Neo Qabbalistic Logos?"</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
it's still Neo Qabbalistic Logos, but they call it le Neo Qabbalistic
Logos."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
nodded, watching Allen's blue eyes. "That was all a lie, wasn't
it."</p><p class="standard">	"Yes.
I forgot you'd seen that movie."</p><p class="standard">	"I
told you never to refer to that again, didn't I?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
you did. I couldn't resist."</p><p class="standard">	"You're
actually happy I asked you to help me and not Mariko or Ai, aren't
you?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes
I am. Truth is, the only thing better than playing <i>Pulp
Fiction </i>with you would be if I
could also get a copy of every game Angel Strike ever released.
Especially the one with the dragon scene."</p><p class="standard">	"The
dragon scene is actually yaoi."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh.
Well, thank god I didn't tell anybody about the nymphette, then."</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
thank your god. I asked myself where mine was when they made me play
that game."</p><p class="standard">	Allen
went over to the machine and got another canned coffee. Given what
they were doing, Yuji didn't find it a particularly good idea to get
twitchy and nervous on caffeine, and said so.</p><p class="standard">	"I
need something to do with my hands," said Allen. "So, I
heard Jaime Vasquez is really into Jolie."</p><p class="standard">	"Really?
He didn't just bang and run, like you were planning to?" Yuji
asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Ha
ha. No, from the sound of it, he actually threw a guy out the window
just for giving her a foot massage."</p><p class="standard">	"Allen,
enough with the movie!"</p><p class="standard">	"Okay,
okay. Actually, I heard she gave him head in the locker room. I heard
it firsthand when I was in the locker room and I heard someone
getting head. I peeked around
the corner and there they were!"</p><p class="standard">	"What
were you doing in there while this was supposedly happening?"
said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"You
doubt me? Okay, I totally screwed up in PE. We were playing
basketball, I was staring at a girl's...you know when the girls are
sitting on the sidelines waiting for their turn to play, and some of
them sit cross-legged, and sometimes you can see the edge of
someone's panties?"</p><p class="standard">	"No,"
said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Man,
you are frigid. Anyway, I had a lead on some pink frills from
Jacqueline von Rickenbacker, but unfortunately I was also playing
basketball. The ball suddenly flew at me and almost hit me in the
head. I managed to get out of the way, but it flew into the audience
and hit Jacqueline. I was standing pretty close to her, and the thing
had just missed me, so I figured no one could see whether it had
actually got me or not. So I sort of made myself fall...right on top
of Jacqueline...and my hand landed in her lap."</p><p class="standard">	"Dumb,
but not worthy of making you clean the locker room after school,"
said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
but when I squeezed her thigh, for some reason she got mad and
screamed," said Allen. "I denied it, but PE teachers,
they'll always believe a girl. Plus there were like eight witnesses
who saw the ball miss me and then saw me throw my arm wildly out
above my head so that it would fall in Jacqueline's lap when it
otherwise wouldn't have."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
held his forehead, needing not to look at Allen for a second. "You
are..."</p><p class="standard">	"I
know, I know! But unlike you, some of us have needs, you know! Not
everyone can just sit around with a bunch of totally hot babes and
feel nothing at all!"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
had stopped listening; he'd just seen someone fitting the description
of their target enter. It was a fat guy, somewhere between sixteen
and twenty, with ridiculous spiked hair on top of a round pinhead
like a cueball. He wore a bright red shirt the color of traffic
light, which, given his girth, just created the impression of a vast
red expanse around his body. He was flanked by two cronies, one
skinny and ratlike, the other huge and bald and wearing a bright
yellow shirt, the same shade of yellow as a school bus.</p><p class="standard">	"Is
that the guy?" Allen asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Looks
like it."</p><p class="standard">	"Pretty
big, huh?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah.
Guess we should've at least brought some baseball bats or something."</p><p class="standard">	They
watched their mark and his two henchmen go to a change machine to get
change for the games, then go to three cabinets side-by-side and
start playing History's Incredible Warriors: HIW. 
</p><p class="standard">	"How
do you want to play this?" Allen asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Let's
just watch him for now. I don't want to confront him in here."</p><p class="standard">	"Right.
Don't want to cause a scene. I gotcha."</p><p class="standard">	So
for a while, they just sat and watched the three scumbags play the
game. They didn't seem to be very good at it, and finally the one in
the red shirt stomped away from his machine and bellowed in a deep
voice that reminded Yuji of the Abominable Snowman from that cartoon
that was supposed to be like Lenny from <i>Of Mice and Men</i>,
"Who's cheating?!"</p><p class="standard">	"Eh,
maybe no one's cheating, Hans," said the one in the yellow
shirt.</p><p class="standard">	"Uroo-say,
Big Yellow, I did your sister."</p><p class="standard">	Big
Yellow, apparently finding this a good enough reason to obey Hans's
order, shut up. The ratlike one piped up and asked, "Eh, but
Hans, ain't you kyoudai?"</p><p class="standard">	"Uroo-say,
Adam. We're half-brothers, and I totally did his mai-mai on the side
that's not related to me," said Hans. "And when I find out
who's cheating here, I'm gonna do that eddiot's sister too."</p><p class="standard">	"But
Hans, what if he ain't got no sister?" asked Adam.</p><p class="standard">	"Uroo-say!
Now, who's cheating?"</p><p class="standard">	No
one came forward to admit they were cheating, so Hans pointed at a
random kid, probably about ten, and yelled, "You! You cheated."</p><p class="standard">	"I
didn't do anything," said the kid.</p><p class="standard">	"If
Hans says ya cheated, ya cheated," said Big Yellow. "So you
better keep your mouth shut."</p><p class="standard">	"Whatever.
I'm outta here," said the kid. He turned to leave, but with
surprising speed, Adam got between him and the door, his ratlike
teeth clicking.</p><p class="standard">	"You
don't say 'whatever' to me," said Hans. "I'll do your
sister!"</p><p class="standard">	"Listen,
I don't—"</p><p class="standard">	"Listen?
You don't tell Hans to listen!" said Big Yellow. He came forward
and pushed the kid's shoulders.</p><p class="standard">	"You
going to do anything?" Allen asked Yuji. Yuji shook his head.
Allen sighed. "Figures. All right, guess it's up to me to
prevent a slaughter." He left the rest area, circled around the
dais, and approached the bank of games where Hans and his gang had
the younger boy cornered. "Hey! Fellas!"</p><p class="standard">	Hans,
his two cronies, and the kid all looked at Allen, who Yuji thought
did well by holding his ground. To Yuji, Hans and his two friends
weren't very imposing, but Yuji knew that was because he always had
recourse to force. Allen would have to talk his way out of this.</p><p class="standard">	"What
do you want?" Hans asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Just
noticed you seemed to be having some trouble, and thinking all this
could be solved without anyone getting hurt."</p><p class="standard">	"Get
outta here, you—" Big Yellow began, but Hans stopped him.</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah.
There <i>is </i>a way to solve this without hurting this kid. Kid, do
you play Rex Iocundi?"</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?"
The kid seemed knocked off balance. Yuji narrowed his eyes, sure now
that this was the scumbag he and Allen were looking for. Allen seemed
to know it too; he didn't look surprised at all.</p><p class="standard">	"Hans
asked if you play Rex Iocundi: King of Gaming," said Big Yellow.
"Because if you hand over the best card in your deck, and if
it's good enough, maybe we won't plaster ya all over the sidewalk."</p><p class="standard">	"Tch."
The kid reached into his pocket and took out a plastic container that
looked like a cigarette container, though it had the logo for Rex
Iocundi: King of Gaming, with the fake Ancient Roman type overlaid on
a golden Doric column. He took out a deck of cards, flipped through,
and produced one for Hans. Big Yellow took the card, stared at it,
and passed it to Adam, who also stared for a second before Hans
snatched it away.</p><p class="standard">	"Onyx-Eyes
Ochre Dragon?" he scoffed. "That's your best?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,"
said the kid.</p><p class="standard">	"You're
a lying eddiot. Big Yellow, look at his deck."</p><p class="standard">	Big
Yellow snatched the container and riffled through the deck. He passed
the deck to Hans, who also looked through every card. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Guess
he wasn't lying. Still a eddiot, though. Look at all this eddiot
crap." Hans tipped the entire pile off his hand, sending cards
flying to the ground in all directions. The Onyx-Eyes Ochre Dragon,
however, went straight into his pocket. "C'mon, guys, let's get
out of here. We'll see what we can get off the eddiots in Club
Shuffle."</p><p class="standard">	The
kid knelt down to pick up his cards. Allen went to help him, but the
kid saw and yelled, "Just go away! You've done enough damage!"</p><p class="standard">	"Hey,
I stopped them from beating the crap outta you!" said Allen.</p><p class="standard">	"They
weren't gonna do anything; they woulda just pushed me around a little
and then left. Now thanks to you, I've lost my Onyx-Eyes Ochre
Dragon!"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
left the rest area and came down to Allen's side. "You're wrong.
They didn't care about the game at all. Their target was your cards
from the beginning." The kid glared at Yuji, and Yuji glared
back, and the kid ignored both of them, picked up the rest of his
cards, and left. "They said something about Club Shuffle. That's
where Mr. Tanaka said his son lost the card."</p><p class="standard">	"Think
we should follow them, then?" Allen asked.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
nodded. "Use your cell phone to look up where it is. We'll
follow at a distance."</p><p class="standard">	They
left the game center. Yuji saw Hans's and Big Yellow's bright shirts
in the middle of a crowd heading towards the train station. He stayed
back, not wanting them to see Allen.</p><p class="standard">	Allen
had out his cell phone and was navigating the Internet, using the
on-screen keyboard with facility. Yuji could never use one of those
things; his fingers were too big and always hit the button he wanted
as well as its two immediate neighbors. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Looks
like Club Shuffle is on the edge of the Neon District, near Koume
Center," said Allen.</p><p class="standard">	"Okay.
We'll wait a minute and head over there on the next train," said
Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	They
slowly made their way to the train station. Hans and his gang had
been lost in the crowd, but Yuji knew they would find the three at
Club Shuffle. He hoped there was some way they could follow the trio
out when they left, and then attack in an area where there were no
police around.</p><p class="standard">	</p><p class="standard">	The
train pulled into the station at the edge of the Neon District and
Allen and Yuji disembarked.</p><p class="standard">	The
area between the Neon District and Dubovy Drive South was mostly
empty lots and strip malls. During the day it was perfectly safe, if
dusty, and families came to shop at all the huge department stores.
At night, it was still mostly safe, if still dusty, but con artists
and bums came in to rip off the unsuspecting. In the evening, when
the transition was taking place, it was entirely possible that two
rich-looking boys like Yuji and Allen would be waylaid by someone.
Yuji hadn't thought he'd have to come here, otherwise he would have
brought a weapon of some sort, but if anyone tried to bother them, he
wasn't going to screw around; it would be force from the get-go.</p><p class="standard">	They
walked past a strip mall towards Koume Center, a convention hall
where doujinshi events were held every so often. Not SaComi, but some
of the smaller events. The area between the strip mall and Koume
Center was a long stretch of empty lots and buildings for rent. Allen
pointed them across the parking lot of a clothing store that had gone
out of business years ago, the building now a shell. They crossed to
the other side, and Yuji saw a small cluster of buildings that looked
inhabited a few blocks up on the other side of the street, the Koume
Center looming in the background.</p><p class="standard">	"That
should be the place," Allen said.</p><p class="standard">	"Great."</p><p class="standard">	The
streetlights came on as they were crossing, and Yuji caught sight of
hobos scuffling around in the alleys. He kept his eye on them as he
and Allen approached the building, covered in peeling white paint. A
small wooden sign had been posted next to the glass door; it read
<i>Club Shuffle: Drinks, Cards, Girls!</i></p><p class="standard">	Yuji
pushed the door open. A bundle of bells hung at the top of the door
frame chimed. Allen put away the cell phone and followed him into the
entrance hall, a small room with red carpet and lanterns that looked
as if they were stolen from a Chinese restaurant. Another sign next
to the door at the end of the hall reiterated the promise of <i>Drinks,
Cards, Girls!</i> and emphasized it with an SD drawing of Gnostic
Magus Girl from the Rex Iocundi anime flipping up her skirt to show
them her purple lace panties. Yuji looked over the walls and noticed
that they were hung with Rex Iocundi cards in frames, but not the
rare cards; these were the ones that all the booster packs were
stuffed with.</p><p class="standard">	Allen
was appreciating the drawing of Gnostic Magus Girl when the door
opened and a tall, greasy man in a Rex Iocundi T-shirt that looked
several sizes too small came in from the main room. "Heya. You
here to play some cards?"</p><p class="standard">	"Nope.
We're here for drinks and girls," said Yuji. "Maybe toss a
few cards around."</p><p class="standard">	"Have
your own decks?" the greaseball asked. He had a strange way of
rotating his head every time he spoke, as if he were trying to
readjust his neck. 
</p><p class="standard">	"No.
We'll have to borrow some."</p><p class="standard">	The
greaseball craned his head to look at Allen, who was still admiring
the sign. "Hey, uh, we've got real ones inside, ya know. They'll
even play cards with ya if you want. Dressed like her."</p><p class="standard">	"Send
her over!" said Allen.</p><p class="standard">	"Glad
to. Youse, ah, want anything special?" Yuji shook his head. "So
da cover charge is twenty bucks a head, plus fifty bucks for a
half-hour wi' a girl. Dat's, eh..." He appeared to think it
over. "Dat's a hundred and fifty bucks. No checks."</p><p class="standard">	"Whaddya
mean, a hundred and fifty—?" Allen began, but Yuji raised
a hand to stop him.</p><p class="standard">	"Math
was never my forte either," he said. "Allen, pay the man."</p><p class="standard">	Grumbling,
Allen took out his credit card and handed it over. When the
greaseball had left, Yuji said, "We have to get inside and make
sure Hans is in here, and we can't afford to make a scene."</p><p class="standard">	"Right,
right. But man! You're paying me back after this."</p><p class="standard">	"I'll
pay you half and call the other half your girl-money."</p><p class="standard">	Allen
was still cursing under his breath when the greaseball returned.
"Here ya go. Enjoy yourself."</p><p class="standard">	"We
will," said Yuji. 
</p><p class="standard">	They
followed the greaseball into the main room, which had also been lit
and carpeted like a Chinese restaurant. On their right, against the
wall, was the bar; on the left was a staircase that led down into a
pit where people played cards at  poker tables with green felt tops.
Directly in front was a raised dais with an empty seat like a throne.

</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
let me know if you find them," said Allen, heading off for the
bar.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
watched him go, then started scanning the card tables for signs of
Hans and his two goons. He walked back and forth three times, looking
across the card tables for their shirts, which should have been
visible from this distance.</p><p class="standard">	Then
he heard noise from the bar behind him, and he turned around and saw
there was some sort of disturbance. He approached, hoping Allen
wasn't involved but knowing he was. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Hey,
Hans, this is the same idiot who was in the arcade earlier,"
Yuji heard Adam saying as he came up. The crowd around them was
clearing, and he could see Allen and the three facing each other from
opposite ends of the bar. Allen's girl, wearing the Gnostic Magus
Girl costume, hung near Allen's side, seeming to wonder if she should
run away or stick around for the tip. 
</p><p class="standard">	Hans
puffed up his chest and said, "What's the matter, eddiot? Didn't
get enough earlier? Want me to do your sister now?"</p><p class="standard">	"I'd
like to see you try," Allen said. "You'd crush her before
you could get it in!"</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?
Don't talk to me like that! I did half the girls in the graduating
class of NHS!" Hans bellowed, shaking his belly and looking like
the Kool-Aid man in his red shirt.</p><p class="standard">	"Nanisgod
High School? God, how many STDs did you get doing that?" Allen
shot back. "I bet you've got the creams from each of them lined
up in your medicine cabinet, with the name of the girl you got it
from written on the label!"</p><p class="standard">	Hans
looked ready to fight, and Yuji saw Allen glance at him. He knew
Allen would never have pushed his luck this far if he didn't expect
Yuji to come in on his side in a fight. Yuji had wanted to avoid
that, but if he had to fight, he would fight, and take the card back
by force.</p><p class="standard">	Suddenly,
the lights in the club darkened and were replaced by red spotlights
pointing up at the dais. Steam began to pour from the roof—Yuji
suspected it was smoke from dry ice—and a drum roll sounded.</p><p class="standard">	"Who
enters my realm bringing violence!" boomed a voice over a
loudspeaker system. A very greasy man, not the greaseball who'd
greeted them but another one, entered from the next room and ascended
the dais. He wore red silk robes embroidered with golden dragons and
pearl buttons, as if he were a Chinese mob boss, though he wasn't
Chinese: he was white, and not even Japanese or Korean. The size of
his nose meant he was definitely European, probably an Italian or a
Frenchman by descent. He was rather tall, and carried himself with
the imperiousness of any adult whose job includes controlling
children, with his arms tightly at his sides, his walking strides
very long, and his gaze unwavering.</p><p class="standard">	"Leader!
I—I didn't mean nothing..." Hans began.</p><p class="standard">	"Silence!
You know better, Hans. You know that all disagreements are to be
judged by me, and if necessary solved by a duel!"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
sir..."</p><p class="standard">	"Now
why are you fighting? Are there not cards, drinks, and girls enough
for all? Rather than quarrel like monkeys, might we not all just get
along?"</p><p class="standard">	"He
has a card we need," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"What?
Repeat yourself, please. I'm rather far away and can't hear you well
if you mumble."</p><p class="standard">	"I
said, he has a card we need!" Yuji repeated. "We're not
leaving without it."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh
ho! A card! And have you your decks?" asked the would-be Chinese
mob boss.</p><p class="standard">	"No,
we came unprepared for such a need," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"What?
I said don't mumble!"</p><p class="standard">	"We
don't have them!"</p><p class="standard">	"Hmm..."
The would-be Chinese mob boss scratched his chin. "Then someone
give them loan of a deck so that they might compete with Hans for
this card they say is so important! And then we shall partake of the
duel!"</p><p class="standard">	The
crowd flooded back in and caught up Yuji, Allen, Hans, and Hans's
goons and conducted them toward the dueling tables. Someone pressed a
deck into Yuji's hand as they were going; he didn't see who. He
couldn't hear anything either; everyone had started chanting "Duel,
duel, duel, duel!" and pumping their fists in the air. He
glanced around and saw that most of the people in here were teenage
boys, but some were older and some were much older, grown men in
their forties and fifties. There were also a few women, most of them
dressed up like characters from the show.</p><p class="standard">	The
crowd came to a stop with Yuji and Allen facing Hans and his goons
from across a table. Hans sat down and laid his deck in one of the
white squares on the table, leering at them with a cackle forming on
his lips.</p><p class="standard">	"Just
so you know," Yuji muttered to Allen, "I can't play this
game at all. I don't even know the rules, except what I've seen when
I was forced to watch the show."</p><p class="standard">	"When
were you forced to watch the show?"</p><p class="standard">	"There's
nothing else on at four-thirty on Thursdays."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
that's when I go to the doujin shop."</p><p class="standard">	"Please
tell me you know the rules."</p><p class="standard">	Allen
scratched the back of his head and looked away.</p><p class="standard">	"Please
tell me..."</p><p class="standard">	"Ah
ha...Yeah, I know them. I've played this game a few times. And I'll
tell you, it's not a game of skill. This game takes more money and
blind luck to be good at it than Texas hold-me."</p><p class="standard">	"You
mean 'hold-em'."</p><p class="standard">	"Whatever.
What I'm trying to say is, with someone's deck that's probably filled
with whatever garbage came in the booster pack, there's no way we'll
be able to win."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
took a glance at the crowd surrounding them. He didn't want to have
to fight his way through all of them, but he supposed he could if he
had to. "Try anyway."</p><p class="standard">	Allen
nodded and set their borrowed deck in the deck square on the card
table. "All right. Let's duel!"</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	"My
god, your driving!" Mariko breathed, stepping out of the minivan
and hitting the pavement so hard she had to check and make sure the
heel of her shoe hadn't broken off. It was still in place, and after
the most terrifying experience of her life, even a broken heel would
have been a small price to exit the car even an instant sooner. "How
did you ever get licensed?"<br />	"He ran over some orange
cones and they handed him a card with his picture on it," said
Yuji. Mariko glanced at him—he acted cool, but she could see he
was terrified as well. She watched him step out of the car and
noticed that he walked away without helping Ai down. It wasn't as
though the drop was beyond Ai, even at her height, but it would have
been a courtesy to show her some regard. She hoped Yuji would at
least stay with Ai during the ball—if he didn't, she would.
Letting a younger girl run around a room full of randy, liquored-up
soon-to-be college students without any supervision would be just
irresponsible.</p><p class="standard">	She
watched Allen get out of the driver's seat. Both of them had rented
tuxedos. Allen's didn't look good on him; his blonde hair and blue
eyes contrasted too much with the stark black and white of the
tuxedo. On the other hand, Yuji wore his well: it emphasized his
leanness and height, and the shades  complemented his skin tone and
hair color. <strike>He almost looked like Pierce Brosnan as James
Bond, although the style of the tuxedo was closer to the one Daniel
Craig had worn. </strike>
</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
took a look around the parking lot. Rather than asphalt, it was done
over with paving stones like the piazza in an Italian village, and
instead of the usual islands planted with bare trees that one usually
saw in Sakura Memorial parking lots, this one had planter boxes with
flowers. Each box was split into fourths: one fourth was devoted to
white flowers, one to yellow, one to pink, and one to purple. Her
mother gardened obsessively, but Mariko had never taken an interest
in it, so she didn't recognize any species, except that she thought
the purple flowers might be hydrangeas, since the petal shape was
different from the other flowers.</p><p class="standard">	She
looked away from the flowers towards the building itself. It was a
magnificent structure, made from white oak and perched on the
mountainside. They had slid backwards several feet at least three
times on the way up, even though the van had an automatic
transmission, but Mariko was starting to feel the drive had been
worth it to come up here. She made for the edge of the parking lot to
look over the side and see the town spread out below them, but
noticed a man in a white suit coming towards them.</p><p class="standard">	"Good
evening. I'm sorry, there must have been some mistake," he said.
"I'm to be Mr. Watanabe's personal servant for the evening. I
tried to catch your attention..."</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
sorry. This is only the sixth time I've driven, and I've never driven
up a mountain," said Allen. "I was a little distracted."</p><p class="standard">	"Of
course. Had you requested, Princess Arishil could have had a car
sent, but..." He glanced at the minivan. "I trust you had
no trouble finding the villa?"</p><p class="standard">	"No,
it was visible from halfway down the mountain," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"If
you don't mind, I shall park the car in the space reserved for
Princess Arishil's honored guests and then return and conduct you to
her. Is this satisfactory?"</p><p class="standard">	"Go
ahead," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Then,
by your leave." He took the keys from Allen and drove the car to
a space twenty feet from the front door that none of them would have
dreamed of pointing out to Allen, since all of them had wanted to get
out of the car as quickly as possible.</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji,
you're the guest of some princess? You never told me," Mariko
said.</p><p class="standard">	He
grimaced. "You didn't ask."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
wondered if he was grimacing because he'd had to do something
unpleasant to be the princess's special guest, or if it was just his
normal propensity to be a sourpuss. Either way, only Yuji could be
annoyed that he got to have his own footman, a special parking space,
and immediate conduction to the princess. 
</p><p class="standard">	<i>He'd
better not be making moves on her, </i>Mariko thought. <i>Not when he
still hasn't answered me... </i>She knew the chances of Yuji hitting
on the princess (or any other girl) were about as good as Allen's
chances of ever losing his virginity, but somehow, she couldn't stop
herself from thinking that any favor to royalty that would get this
sort of special treatment must have involved something naughty.</p><p class="standard">	"Hey,
Ai?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
Mariko?" 
</p><p class="standard">	"Where'd
you get that dress? It looks great on you!"</p><p class="standard">	Ai
blushed on hearing that. She was wearing a modestly cut aquamarine
dress that complemented her eyes very well, and had put her hair in a
cute braid with a ribbon at the end and a silver butterfly above her
ear. She was also actually wearing makeup. Mariko had helped her with
the makeup, but she hadn't been able to borrow a dress from her
mother or Mariko: both of them were too tall and busty. So Mariko was
curious where she had ended up getting one.</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
well, I got it from..."</p><p class="standard">	"My
mother," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Your
mother?" Mariko repeated. "No way!"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes."</p><p class="standard">	"Then
your mother is..."</p><p class="standard">	"Funnily
enough, my mother is about the size of a fourteen-year-old girl, yes.
Probably why my dad married her, come to think of it."</p><p class="standard">	"Then
you must take after your dad," said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"Now
that you mention it, I'd never noticed it before, but yes, I do look
rather larger than a fourteen-year-old girl, don't I? And here I am,
with someone who's about the size of fourteen-year-old girl."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
don't be an ass. I was just making conversation." Mariko doubted
the dress had actually been borrowed from Yuji's mother. If she could
separate them, she might be able to get the truth out of Ai, but with
Yuji around the cover story would stay in place. Yuji wasn't a good
liar—his delivery was always too sarcastic—but he was
tenacious in holding to a cover story.</p><p class="standard">	"You
know, I can't believe I was too busy to notice how hot you both
look!" Allen said.</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
we?" Mariko agreed, giving a twirl. She felt she did this
gracefully despite her height. Her dress was a present from her
father for doing well enough in high school to even consider college;
he'd promised a computer as a graduation gift, but she wouldn't hold
him to it if he told her there wasn't money. The dress was black and
shin-length, like Ai's, though for a different reason: Mariko knew
her legs were more muscular than they should be, and was a bit
embarrassed at the idea of showing them off. She had put her hair up,
and her mother had even let her borrow a set of pearl earrings.</p><p class="standard">	She
saw Ai was blushing even more deeply at Allen's compliment, and when
Ai reached up to nervously adjust the butterfly in her hair, Mariko
noticed another accessory: a plain golden band on Ai's left ring
finger, like a wedding ring.</p><p class="standard">	"Hey,
nice ring. Where'd you get it? Yuji's mother?" Mariko asked.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
shook her head. "No. This was a gift from my brother."</p><p class="standard">	"Your
brother? I didn't know you had a brother. Where is he?"</p><p class="standard">	"He
doesn't live with us...He's with my father, overseas."</p><p class="standard">	"Are
you two close?"</p><p class="standard">	She
blushed again, but she also smiled, a more genuine smile than Mariko
had seen yet. "Yes, we were very close. We had similar
interests." She seemed to want to say more, but the smile told
Mariko more than any omitted words. 
</p><p class="standard">	The
footman returned and bowed to them all. "I apologize for the
delay. Shall we go in?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
nodded, and the four of them followed him towards the building. As
they went, Mariko noticed that many of the cars in the lot were
minivans, Toyotas, and old Hyundais, and remembered that this ball
was open to anyone from the high school. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Is
this ball open to students from Nanisgod High School as well?"
she asked the footman.</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
although we expect fewer attendees from Nanisgod than from Robert
Read."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
an odd question," Yuji commented.</p><p class="standard">	"I
used to go there and made some enemies," said Mariko. "Just
hope I don't see any of them here."</p><p class="standard">	"I
warn you that no unpleasantness will be tolerated," said the
footman. "Prince Vanadiel's guards shall eject anyone causing
trouble."</p><p class="standard">	"Thanks
for the warning. I'll try to avoid that," said Mariko. <i>Stuck-up
bastard.</i></p><p class="standard">	The
staircase spread down toward them like clam shells. As they climbed
up, Mariko noticed a wall of trellises overgrown with climbing vines
to her right.  <i>Must be a garden</i>, she thought. That garden
probably had an amazing view of the city below; she would have to try
and get in later.</p><p class="standard">	The
solid mahogany doors had been thrown open to admit the flow of people
that would have been going in a half hour ago; because of Allen's
driving, they had arrived a little late, so hardly anyone was going
in anymore. It wasn't until Mariko saw the sign, also carved from
mahogany and standing out against the white stone of the doorway,
reading 123
Pecan Street—Royal Family of Montagria,
that
she stopped to wonder where 122 and 124 Pecan Street were on the side
of this mountain. 
</p><p class="standard">	They
passed into the main hall. The
roof was a good three hundred feet above their heads, much higher
than it had looked from the outside. The hall was bright, with white
oak walls and staircases and beige rugs on the marble floor. In the
center of the room the floor changed to hardwood, but the dance
hadn't begun yet, so everybody just milled around in the center of
the room. There were more people than Mariko had ever seen. There
were so many she couldn't even pick out individuals; they seemed to
be just one big mass of tuxedos and dresses. The only ones who stood
out were the waiters and waitresses,
who circulated around the room holding silver platters loaded with
drinks and canapés
above their heads. Surrounded by the seething mass and jostled
on all sides by elbows and knees, it was amazing that they kept the
trays balanced.</p><p class="standard">	"Shall
all four of you be meeting with Princess Arishil, or only yourself,
Mr. Watanabe?" the footman asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Myself
and her," said Yuji, touching Ai on the shoulder. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Princess?"
Allen asked, immediately perking up.</p><p class="standard">	"Very
good. Then I bid you good evening, and hope that you enjoy the party.
If you wish, several of our guests are instructors at the academy,
and—ah, here are some of them now! Professor Lumbil, Professor
Rojinjo!"</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
saw that he was trying to catch the attention of two women with
pointed ears, like Vulcans. One was frighteningly tall. She wore a
tuxedo, although other than her height she looked feminine enough.
Her purple
hair was pulled back
in a braid, similar to Ai's. The other woman was blonde and much more
slight, and wore a midnight blue gown. Both saw the footman and came
over, the blonde woman for some reason looking smug, and the
freakishly tall one looking angry.</p><p class="standard">	"Mr.
Watanabe, let me introduce Miss Mirufa Lumbil and Miss Jinjo
Rojinjo," said the footman, motioning first to the blonde one
and then to the tall one.</p><p class="standard">	"We've
met," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Miss
Lumbil, may I impose upon you to take Mr. Watanabe and his escort to
Princess Arishil? I'm afraid I have other duties to which I must
attend."</p><p class="standard">	"Of
course," said the blonde woman. "Come with me." She
led Yuji and Ai away, towards the staircase on their left, leaving
Mariko with Allen and the grouchy-looking Vulcan.</p><p class="standard">	"What
d'you reckon? Split up, or stay together?" Allen asked. 
</p><p class="standard">	"If
we stay together, people might think we're...you know...together,"
said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
okay with that!"</p><p class="standard">	"You
were saying in the car you wanted to meet a rich girl. Don't you
still want to find some dumb girl who's the heir to a kingdom and
seduce her, living in the lap of luxury for the rest of your life?"</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
when you put it that way—See you later!" He disappeared
into the crowd.</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
was about to do the same, but the tall woman stepped up to her and
stared at her. Mariko expected her to talk, but she just kept staring
until Mariko asked, "Can
I help you?"</p><p class="standard">	The
tall Vulcan grunted. "You actually want to go to this school, or
are you just here for the food?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't know yet. That's why I'm here. You teach at the school, right?
What can you tell me?"</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
the 'Professor' thing is more of an honorary title. Stupid really,
but we're supposed to be allies with the Montagrians, so we've got to
keep pretending like we care what they want. But I can tell you one
thing: this is the only school that'll teach you to use your 'special
talents'."</p><p class="standard">	"What
does that mean? It's actually a brothel?"</p><p class="standard">	"No,
you cheeky brat. I mean you're a nyvamna."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko's
heart skipped a beat. "How did you—?"</p><p class="standard">	"You
see these ears, right? They aren't made of rubber, you know. I ain't
human. And that means I can take readings on nyvamna. I knew before I
even saw you there was one in the room I'd never read before."</p><p class="standard">	"What
was your name again?" Mariko asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Jinjo
Rojinjo. Call me Jinjo. I'm an elf."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
Mariko Takahashi. Call me Mariko."</p><p class="standard">	The
tall Vulcan smiled for the first time. Her teeth were so exposed it
was more of a snarl, but it was the closest she'd come to a friendly
gesture. "Okay. Good to meet you."</p><p class="standard">	"Can
you read what abilities I've got?" Mariko asked.</p><p class="standard">	"No.
But I can tell how well you'd use them in a fight—how much
they'd hurt if you hit me with everything you've got."</p><p class="standard">	"How
do I measure up?"</p><p class="standard">	Jinjo
shook her head. "Right now, not too well. But you're lucky:
you're a chikara-type. Some training, and you'd be up there. Not like
some of the other types, who can't get any better, and got to take up
other things to get ahead. That's where the school comes in.
Gottslehrer is the biggest nyvamna training facility this side of the
American government."</p><p class="standard">	"Why?
What do people who've trained at Gottslehrer do after graduation?"</p><p class="standard">	"Most
of 'em just become pencil-pushers like a graduate from any other
school. But some of 'em are recruited by the Americans. Some go into
the service of the Montagrians. And a few, we get."</p><p class="standard">	"Who's
'we'?"</p><p class="standard">	"The
Sixteen, the last survivors of Fung. Princess Arishil is our leader."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
considered for a moment whether she should ask the next question.
"Why...why does she want to see Yuji?"</p><p class="standard">	"None
'a your business," Jinjo growled. "If he tells you, not
much we can do about it. But I'm not gonna tell you." Then she
seemed to reconsider. "I'll tell you this much: he's going to be
one of the ones we get. If you want to keep seein' him, you'll go to
Gottslehrer and train your nyvamna abilities."</p><p class="standard">	"And
Ai?"</p><p class="standard">	"Just
a nuisance to Princess Arishil. But not for long." Jinjo turned
to leave.</p><p class="standard">	"What
do you mean by that?" Mariko asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Nothing.
Don't worry about it and enjoy the party." Jinjo waved over her
shoulder as she disappeared into the crowd.</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
was about to do just that when she was approached by a younger girl,
probably about fifteen, with hair dyed black, black eye shadow, black
lipstick, and a lip ring. Her dress looked like it had been made from
a cut-up leather jacket, and was covered with superfluous straps and
buckles; a slit in the skirt just showed the edge of a pair of black
panties with black frills. All in all, she looked like the sort of
girl who cut herself in the dark while weeping to Green Day's 'Time
of Your Life', though her arms lacked any obvious wounds.</p><p class="standard">	"Were
you just talking to Miss Rojinjo?" she asked Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah...What
about it?" Mariko looked at the girl's face, trying to recall if
she'd had any enemies who looked like this at Nanisgod High School.
It was hard to remember; there'd been so many of them back in those
stupid days of middle school and her freshman year in high school.</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
like, what did she say?" the girl asked.</p><p class="standard">	"She
was telling me about Gottslehrer Academy," said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"Like,
what did she tell you?"</p><p class="standard">	"Um..."</p><p class="standard">	"Ayame!"
Another girl approached, this one wearing a white gown. Her
white-blonde hair had been braided like Ai's, and reached all the way
to her thighs. She'd worn a yellow headband to keep her bangs out of
her face, but still had to keep pushing them out of her eyes as she
came over, walking purposefully.</p><p class="standard">	"Like,
hi, Ayane. Like, this girl was talking to Miss Rojinjo, so like, I
thought I'd ask her some questions."</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
don't bother her. I'm sure she has other things to do," said the
second girl, Ayane. "I apologize if she was bothering you."</p><p class="standard">	"Uh,
no. Not really. Listen, have we met before? Do you go to NHS?"</p><p class="standard">	Ayame
and Ayane both nodded. "Yes, we do," said Ayane. "As
does our sister, Ayumi. But I don't recall meeting you..."</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
I used to go there," said Mariko. "But I switched to Robert
Read. I just wondered if I'd seen you there. But I guess you're too
young."</p><p class="standard">	"I
was on TV a while ago," said Ayame, the girl who was fixated on
black leather. "You might've seen me there."</p><p class="standard">	"What
show?" Mariko asked.</p><p class="standard">	"It
was called 'Undyingness of Love', on MTV. Me and these other twelve
girls tried to win a date with Raven Sundark. I almost won, but they
found out I lied about my age and kicked me off. It was whack."</p><p class="standard">	"Okay..."</p><p class="standard">	"I
apologize again," said the clean girl, Ayane. "She's
developed something of a fixation on Professor Rojinjo, and that's
why we're here tonight."</p><p class="standard">	"Are
you gonna go to Gottslehrer?" Ayame asked, giving Mariko a dazed
look that suggested she'd been hitting the champagne that was
circulating the room pretty hard.</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
thinking about it," Mariko admitted. She was intrigued by the
thought of a school that would teach her how to use her nyvamna
abilities, which had been under wraps for a while.</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
thank you for humoring my sister," said Ayane. "Come on,
Ayame, we should go meet with the prince..."</p><p class="standard">	"No
need to seek for me. I stand before you."</p><p class="standard">	The
person who had spoken last was a very slim man with black hair and
blue eyes. He was dressed like Elvis, in a white cape, a white
double-breasted jacket, white pants with flared legs, and white
leather boots. As he came toward them he swept the cape out
gracefully behind him, and Mariko could've sworn he gave a covert hip
gyration.</p><p class="standard">	"I
am Prince Vanadiel Thaddeus Ergastulum Honorius Bagonel Lester
Wangchuck Bonorum Nonbat Egwimphron the Third, of Montagria," he
said, giving a swish of his cape. "I greet you, Sovereigns of
Hendenburke."</p><p class="standard">	"We
are honored to be in your presence," said Ayane. "I am
Ayane Koroleva Khendenburka. This is my sister, Ayame Koroleva
Khendenburka."</p><p class="standard">	"It
was said that you numbered three. Is this your third?" the
prince asked, looking at Mariko. 
</p><p class="standard">	"No,
I'm not," said Mariko. "I'm a student from Robert Read
Remembrance High School."</p><p class="standard">	"Our
sister is in the crowd," said Ayane. "We shall find her
before the night is out."</p><p class="standard">	"No
need to hurry," said the prince, shaking his head like a
whinnying horse and flashing his bright white teeth. "For this
year is not the year in which you come to my family's school."</p><p class="standard">	"No,
we have two years still before that day arrives," said Ayane.</p><p class="standard">	"But
you," said the prince, turning to Mariko and flashing his teeth
again. He was handsome, despite his fashion sense, and his movements
were very supple and graceful. "You shall attend my school
soon."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
thinking about it," said Mariko. "So, the school offers
classes in Outer Rim politics?"</p><p class="standard">	"Not
politics only, but history, language, literature, all things 'twixt
which sit our fair lands," said the prince.</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
wanted to ask how much literature it was possible to write when most
of the last few hundred years or so had been spent killing as many of
your own people as possible, but she had enough sense not to. She
nodded and waited for the prince to leave, but he just stared at her
while the two weirdos from NHS watched the two of them intently.
Mariko was about to ask why he was still staring at her when the
entire room was filled with people he could be greeting, but she was
saved by the entrance of Ai and Yuji, brought down the staircase by
the blonde Vulcan.</p><p class="standard">	"...enjoy
the rest of the night without worrying over whatever the princess may
have told you," the blonde Vulcan was saying. "There are
many here you may like to meet—ah, here's one now! Prince
Vanadiel!"</p><p class="standard">	"Good
even, Lady Mirufa. I trust I find you well in body and spirit?"
the prince inquired. He smiled again, keeping his teeth exposed this
time—for some reason he was really turning on the charm.</p><p class="standard">	"Very
well, good sir. These two have business to discuss with my mistress,
but it has finished and they are now available to join your
delightful gathering. This is Yuji Watanabe, and this is Ai Maeda,
both of Sakura Memorial."</p><p class="standard">	The
prince nodded briefly at Yuji, his face for a moment blank, then
dialed up the charm again as he turned to Ai. "Greetings, Lady
Nembris. It is good to at last lay eyes upon you once again."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
glanced at Yuji, who looked irked, then at Ai, who seemed lost. "I'm
sorry," she said, shaking her head. "You must have the
wrong person. My name is Ai Maeda."</p><p class="standard">	"Of
course. I apologize, I must have been mistaken," said the
prince. He took her hand and led her away from Yuji and the blonde
elf. "Feelest thou the pangs of hunger, or the grinding of
thirst?"</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
no, I'm fine," Ai answered, gently taking her hand away from
his. Mariko saw the prince almost imperceptibly grind his teeth when
this happened.</p><p class="standard">	"Then
perhaps we might converse, simply that I might for one more moment
occupy your presence," said the prince.</p><p class="standard">	"Okay...um,
well, I wanted to ask about the language programs at your school..."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
saw the blonde Vulcan leave, so she stepped around Ai and the prince
to get to Yuji. "How's it going?"</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
just swell," Yuji answered.</p><p class="standard">	"What
did you talk to the princess about?"</p><p class="standard">	"'Eat
Your Carrots Meow'. She loves the girl with the hair decorations that
look like computer mice. Also she loves how every episode teaches you
a fun new way to enjoy your vegetables."</p><p class="standard">	"Seems
you feel ignored by our dashing prince."</p><p class="standard">	"He
does seem to have a preference for jailbait, doesn't he?" Yuji
said. 
</p><p class="standard">	"He's
a prince," said Mariko. "He doesn't go to jail for
anything."</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
worry, though, I know my prince is still out there, and someday he'll
come to sweep me off my feet."</p><p class="standard">	"Are
you trying to tell me something?" Mariko asked. "Like that
you can't date me, because you only like men?"</p><p class="standard">	She
regretted saying it immediately. She wanted three things from Yuji:
for him to tell her what he spoke with the princess about, for him to
make peace with Yumiko, and for him to date her. But it was fun to
trade jibes as they'd been doing, and she was willing to settle for
that while she waited for the other three. She didn't want to ruin
that by needling him too much, but she'd ended up doing it anyway.</p><p class="standard">	She
decided to try and repair things before he ran off. "Sorry. I
didn't mean to do that. Just forget I said anything."</p><p class="standard">	"Forgotten,"
said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Good.
Then maybe you'd be willing to dance with me so I don't have to feel
like a loser when the music starts."</p><p class="standard">	She
watched him, the pause seeming years long. At last he nodded. "All
right. But I've got to go."</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?"</p><p class="standard">	"You
know, private stuff. In the private room."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
of course."</p><p class="standard">	"Back
in a minute." He fought through the crowd of teenagers,
tweenagers, and adults to the staircase.</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
noticed that the prince had managed to get rid of the two girls from
NHS; it was just him and Ai, slowly drifting away. Mariko saw the
prince put his hand on her arm; Ai waited a moment, then reached up
to push her bangs off her forehead, shrugging off his hand as she
did. Mariko could no longer hear what they were saying over the noise
of the party, but when she saw  them start to walk towards one of the
doors that led out of the hall, she followed, avoiding being seen as
well as she could. It was obvious what the prince had on his mind,
and Mariko wanted to be nearby in case Ai needed rescuing, even if it
meant missing her dance with Yuji, who was too caught up in himself
to bother looking after the younger girl.</p><p class="standard">	The
door stood open to let the servers in and out. Mariko saw the prince
and Ai slip inside. She waited a second. Another group of waiters,
wielding a new array of hors d'oeuvres, surged out. She waited until
they stopped coming and then slipped inside.</p><p class="standard">	The
passage she found herself in was carpeted in beige. Mariko passed two
doors carved from mahogany and came to the corner of this passage and
the next, passing an end table with a vase of flowers on it. On her
right was a staircase coming toward the corner, its foot at the end
of the hall before a door: on the left, a bank of doors ending in one
that seemed to lead to the kitchen.</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
was trying to figure out which of these the prince and Ai would have
taken when she heard someone coming and opened the nearest door on
her left. She stepped over a jumble of vacuum cleaner hoses, rags,
and cans of Pledge to get inside, and closed the door all but a
crack. A second later someone came around the corner, walking
quickly. She heard another door open and then close. She was about to
leave the closet when she saw someone else come around the corner and
stop just in front of the crack. She tensed, wondering if she'd been
discovered, but then she heard static, as if from a radio or
walkie-talkie, and then the man standing outside started talking.</p><p class="standard">	"He's
in the garden, probably heading towards you."</p><p class="standard">	The
voice seemed familiar, but Mariko couldn't place it. It was a high,
whining voice, like the annoying comedian Louie Anderson, whose
crappy cartoon had been on when Mariko was a kid. For some reason it
made Mariko think of punching someone. Perhaps she'd punched someone
with a similar voice, or maybe it just made her feel like wanting to
punch him.</p><p class="standard">	More
static, and then a voice from the walkie-talkie replied. "Good.
We'll surround him. Take the back door from the kitchen, but don't
let anyone see you. Pretend you're taking out the garbage if you have
to."</p><p class="standard">	"Affirmative.
Miba out."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
felt her heart sink. <i>Miba</i>. She'd heard his annoying voice when
he'd been haranguing the students about how smart and great he was.
The Sakura police were supposed to have transferred him to the
custody of the US government, but obviously hadn't. He'd probably
seen her and Yuji during the fight, so maybe he'd figured out who
they were and come to take revenge. That meant the one he was chasing
was probably Yuji. And he had an accomplice.</p><p class="standard">	Well,
Yuji had an accomplice too. Mariko waited for Miba to leave, then
tumbled out of the closet. It would be tricky, trying to follow him
through the kitchen without being seen. She wondered if she should
pull the movie trick and steal a server's uniform to blend in. No,
not enough time. She would just have to stay out of his sight.</p><p class="standard">	She
went to the kitchen door and blundered in, immediately assaulted by
noise and heat. Everything in the kitchen seemed to be made of steel,
and the harsh light of the bank of fluorescents above jumped from
surface to surface. It took Mariko a second to orient herself, just
in time to get away from the doors and avoid being run over by a
convoy of waiters and waitresses. An island split two rows of cooks,
all of whom seemed to be yelling, swearing, sweating, sauteing, and
dishing up. 
</p><p class="standard">	Her
shoes slipped on the tile floor, and Mariko took them off and carried
them under her arm. The dress was no good for fighting in, but it
would be better without the high heels. A cook ran at her wielding a
five-gallon pot of boiling stock. Mariko flattened herself against
the wall and avoided being burned alive. She slipped between the
cooks, trying to find the door to the back.</p><p class="standard">	She
found it, a heavy metal door on a pneumatic arm with some text
printed on it in a language she didn't recognize. She pushed the door
open, feeling cool mountain air blow across her face, and stumbled
into the darkness.</p><p class="standard">	After
being flooded with light, it took Mariko's eyes another second to
adjust to the darkness. She heard Miba saying, "You're trapped"
an instant before his shape faded into focus. He was about ten feet
in front of her, facing away. Yuji was a further ten feet or so away,
huddled against a bank of trashcans, and behind him was a
curly-headed teenager who Mariko assumed was Miba's accomplice. If
so, Miba couldn't have chosen a less imposing one. He was short,
seemed jittery, as if he'd drunk eight cups of coffee at the party,
and his shaggy hair made him look like a poodle or an alpaca. Yuji
was getting the easy part.</p><p class="standard">	"Trapped
like Tupac, eh Watanabe?" the alpaca-boy said. <i>An
appreciation for classical music doesn't make you any scarier, </i>Mariko
thought<i>.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>She
was about to spring on Miba and take him out with a fist to the
spine, her arm tingling as if it had fallen asleep with all the power
she had mustered, but then saw that Yuji wasn't even looking at Miba.
He was staring off to his side, into the garden.</p><p class="standard">	"Thug
life," he remarked.</p><p class="standard">	<i>Dammit,
Yuji! This isn't the time for jokes!</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>Then
his gaze drifted back, almost lazily, and met Mariko's, and she knew
it was time. Throwing her shoes aside, she sprang forward, and with a
huge yell, sank her fist into the small of Miba's back, discharging
all the energy she could. There was a noise like a thunderclap, and
Mariko felt a wave of heat cross her arm and a coldness within her
chest, that familiar feeling from the days of middle school when
she'd used her nyvamna powers almost every day. Miba was knocked flat
on his face.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
had reacted at the same time; now he had a switchblade knife in his
hand and the alpaca-boy on the ground in an armlock, awaiting only a
little pressure to snap his elbow out of its socket. Mariko came up
alongside Miba and kicked him in the ribs, feeling a surge of
adrenaline. She almost kicked him in the face, but held herself back.</p><p class="standard">	"See,
Mariko. This is more fun than a dance, isn't it?" said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	</p><p class="standard">	Ai
pushed open the door of Club Shuffle, feeling relieved to be off the
street. She'd done her best to dress in a way that wouldn't attract
attention, even wearing her only pair of jeans instead of a skirt,
and come when it was still partially light outside, but a lone
fifteen-year-old girl walking in this part of town at dusk attracted
the wrong sort of attention no matter how she was dressed. 
</p><p class="standard">	She
waited for the doorman, glancing at the sandwich board with the
picture of the anime character showing off her panties and wondering
if it was really any safer in here than out there. She hated the
entire situation: having to come here, having to worry about her
safety, having to wonder what she would have to do to convince Woraco
that she was sincere. Ever since she'd come to this island, she'd
been trapped between worries and embarrassments; she'd had her finger
broken, and—for the most part—been happier than she had
been in years.</p><p class="standard">	The
doorman came in. "Welcome to—whoa, a girl. Whatsa matter,
sweets, you need'a use the phone or something?"</p><p class="standard">	"No...I
need to see Woraco," said Ai. "Please bring me to him."</p><p class="standard">	"Eh,
whaddya need to see that old goat for? Why not come in and play some
cards, have a few drinks?"</p><p class="standard">	"No,
I really just need to see Woraco," Ai insisted. "Please..."</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
I guess. Follow me."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
followed him into the main room. They had just started to set up for
the evening, but the place was already nearly full. There was a crowd
around the bar and at least half of the card tables were occupied.
Girls, dressed in bikinis, facepaint, and plastic ears, were moving
around like mad, filling orders for drinks and company.</p><p class="standard">	The
doorman led Ai past the bar towards a small door on the far wall. The
door led into a narrow passageway with a wooden staircase that led
up. "Up the stairs, first door on your left," said the
doorman.</p><p class="standard">	"Thank
you," said Ai, bowing to him. She started up the stairway,
noticing that the doorman lingered around the foot of the stairs
until she had nearly reached the top.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
took the door the greasy footman had told her and found herself in a
small, cluttered, but mostly clean room with carpet. In the middle of
the room, sitting at a desk surrounded by several bookshelves, was an
old man. He was hunched over some document, staring at it through his
glasses with such intent that at first he didn't notice Ai. She
waited for him to look up, standing quietly near the door, but he
showed no sign of noticing her, so at last she spoke to get his
attention. "Woraco...?"</p><p class="standard">	"Eh?
Yes, yes. Who are you, then?" he asked.</p><p class="standard">	"My
name is Ai Maeda. You've heard it before, though you probably don't
remember that I belong to it. I was quite a bit younger. Also I may
have been going by the name of Aya Alexandros, or possibly—"</p><p class="standard">	"Nembris
Linturi," the old man interrupted. "Yes, yes. So, Nembris,
daughter of Litziprosh, have you come to kill me at last?"</p><p class="standard">	"Please,
my name is Ai Maeda. That's my human name, and it's how I've always
thought of myself," said Ai. "Even my brother never called
me Nembris."</p><p class="standard">	"Now
it comes back to me. The last time we met, I had killed rats larger
than you, though your mother insisted you were eight years old. You
were going by Aya Alexandros. Belfast, wasn't it?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes.
My father sent us to get intelligence from you."</p><p class="standard">	"I
had nearly killed that, what's that cousin of yours, impertinent
bastard with the knife fetish—"</p><p class="standard">	"Zakinthos."</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
yes. Well, I must admit you've grown a bit. I've still seen larger
rats, but you outstrip the majority of them. Well,
Ai-Maeda-is-my-human-name-and-how-I've-always-thought-of-myself, you
may think killing me will get you and your family somewhere, but I
assure you I have no vital role in this project. I am a pawn, like
yourself. A pawn whose tricks have become so well-known that even a
girl whose three sizes until four years ago were closer to 15-12-15
than 36-28-36 can track him down with a few web queries...I assume
that is how you found me?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,"
said Ai. "I knew it would be some kind of gaming house. You told
me how much you loved games when we first met. You even showed me a
card trick."</p><p class="standard">	"You
would not have confronted me openly unless you wished to prolong the
battle. I doubt that I can win, but perhaps I can at least leave a
scar on that pretty face that you won't soon forget." He rose
from his chair, unfurling his wizened limbs, and Ai saw that he
wasn't someone she'd like to fight, even inside a reality bubble: his
limbs, wrinkled as they were, were still wrapped in muscle, and she
could feel waves of intensity rising from him.</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
not here to fight," she said quickly.</p><p class="standard">	The
intensity was gone, and in an instant, the old man was back in his
chair. "Then why are you here?" he asked.</p><p class="standard">	"I
want to defect," said Ai.</p><p class="standard">	Woraco
surveyed her through the lenses of his small glasses. He didn't
speak. Ai stared back, feeling herself start to blink too much, and
finally turned red and glanced away, catching sight of a picture on
the wall. It lay half hidden in the shadows, but she saw the shapes
of four men, one of them Woraco, standing against a plain background.</p><p class="standard">	"What
are you talking about? Why should you defect? Are <i>you</i>
defective?" Woraco snapped. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Please,
just hear me out," said Ai. "I can't give exact details,
not yet, but my father sent me here with a mission. But—I don't
think I can do it. It feels like the wrong thing to do. I can't
explain it very well, since I don't really understand it myself, but
I feel as if completing this mission will take away the things that
make me happy."</p><p class="standard">	"You?
Ridiculous!" Woraco scoffed. "Why send you? Why not your
brother?"</p><p class="standard">	"He
wasn't sure Xenophon would be strong enough," said Ai.
"And...also, he thought it might be easier for me...as a girl, I
mean."</p><p class="standard">	"I
see exactly what you mean," said Woraco. "Now come, there's
been some disturbance in the main hall, and I think you may want to
see it."</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?"</p><p class="standard">	"Follow
me, please."</p><p class="standard">	Woraco
led the way out of the room. Ai followed him, confused, to another
door across the landing. They came out on a balcony above the bar,
overlooking the card tables. A crowd had gathered around one of the
tables.</p><p class="standard">	"Looks
as though this took very little time," said Woraco. He motioned
at the giant digital scoreboard across the room. A game was in
progress; one player had all of his life points, while the other was
down to his last hundred. One more hit from almost anything would
finish him.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
looked down to try and see who was playing and realized with a shock
that she recognized both players. One was the idiot in the red shirt,
dimly recalled from her drunken state, who had tried to accost her in
the arcade. The one who had known the names of all the parts of
Manreeki the Unforgiving One. The other was Allen, and Yuji was
standing at his side.</p><p class="standard">	"When
did they—We must have missed each other by minutes!"</p><p class="standard">
	Allen's
life point counter dialed down to zero.</p><p class="standard">
	"Duel
over!" announced the referee, who was dressed up as the
turquoise elf woman from the Ax of Destiny, Death, Dream,
Destruction, Desire, Despair, and Delirium, and Delight card. The
costume worked for him.</p><p class="standard">
	"Ha!
Booya! It's my birthday, nuh uh!" Hans cried, standing up and
gyrating his hips. Ai cringed at the sight. 
</p><p class="standard">
	"Why
are they here?" she asked Woraco. "Did you plan this? You
can't reveal me—Yuji already knows what I am."</p><p class="standard">
	"I
did not," said Woraco. "This is the work of the Montagrians
acting alone. It is a coincidence that they ended up in my
establishment."</p><p class="standard">
	"Who
is he?" Ai asked, pointing to the French-Chinese not mob boss.</p><p class="standard">
	"Oh,
Richard? He's rather overzealous at times, but his expertise is
useful when it comes to selling the cards we win here."</p><p class="standard">
	"So...this
club takes cards from teenagers and sells them?"</p><p class="standard">
	"Yes.
Not moral, but an effective way to establish capital."</p><p class="standard">
	Ai
looked away and saw that Allen and Yuji were standing now. She heard
Yuji speak, with more determination than she thought she'd ever heard
from him.</p><p class="standard">
	"We
need that card," he said.</p><p class="standard">
	"The
results of the match are binding!" declared Richard, the
Chinese-French not mob boss.</p><p class="standard">
	"Nevertheless,
we need that card," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">
	"Shut
up, you eddiot!" said Hans. "I'll do your sister!"</p><p class="standard">
	<i>That
wasn't very smart </i>Ai thought. 
</p><p class="standard">
	It
took longer than she'd thought it would, but after a short pause,
Yuji calmly grabbed the card table by the edge and flung it at Hans
amidst a hail of cards. Hans raised his arm and stepped back
reflexively; the table hit him in the wrist, knocking his pudgy hand
into his nose and sending him to fall on his rear end. 
</p><p class="standard">
	The
crowd immediately backed off a few feet. "Stop this!"
screamed Richard; the doorman who had brought Ai to Woraco came
trotting out. Yuji seized a folded chair and hurled it at him like a
discus; it caught him in the stomach and sent him down for the count.

</p><p class="standard">
	"Give
me the card," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">
	Adam
swung a folding chair at Yuji; Yuji sidestepped and deliver a low
side kick to his shin and a backhand to his nose almost
simultaneously. Big Yellow seized Yuji by the shirt; Yuji's fist
thrust into his solar plexus. Adam came in for another attack, and
Yuji sidestepped, putting Big Yellow in the blow's path; the folding
chair slammed into the back of Big Yellow's skull. Yuji pushed Big
Yellow out of the way and made a move toward Adam, who dropped the
chair and ran to the other side of the room.</p><p class="standard">
	Hans
came barreling in, trying to catch Yuji by surprise, but Yuji punched
him on the nose and then swept his legs from under him, knocking him
on his rear end again.</p><p class="standard">
	"Y-you
can't hurt me! See, I have the Dark Mystical Sacred Dark God of
Melkyuli The Winged Messenjall!" cried Hans, waving the card at
Yuji as he advanced. "Nothing beats a God Card!"</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji
took the Dark Mystical Sacred Dark God of Melkyuli The Winged
Messenjall, tore it into fourths, and scattered them. "Give me
the card."</p><p class="standard">
	Hans
took out his card case and drew a card. "Here! Just take the
damn thing!" He wiped the trail of blood running down his nose
and extended the card to Yuji.</p><p class="standard">
	"Ee.
One Mystical Sacred Dark God of Dark Hoddace Ruler of the Moger. All
right, Allen, let's get out of here!"</p><p class="standard">
	Allen,
who had been chatting up the girl dressed as Gnostic Magus Girl,
broke away from her side. "Right! Let's blow this joint!"</p><p class="standard">
	"Stop
them! Stop them!" Richard was screaming, but no one tried to
stop them as they walked up the stairs and out the door. 
</p><p class="standard">
	Woraco
chuckled. "That boy certainly has guts. I see now why you love
him."</p><p class="standard">
	Ai
blushed. "I-I never said that!"</p><p class="standard">
	"Perhaps
the fifteen-year-old girl within you truly is stronger than the
monster. Perhaps you do deserve the human name of Ai Maeda, instead
of the murderer's name Nembris Linturi."</p><p class="standard">
	"I,
I do like him, as a friend, and I..." Ai trailed off, beginning
to wonder why she was discussing her relationship with Yuji with this
old man.</p><p class="standard">
	Woraco
chuckled again, and then his face became serious. "I believe we
can make a deal regarding your defection, but it won't be easy. My
superiors will have their own ideas on what to do with you, and they
won't take your will into account. You may end up losing what you
sought to save."</p><p class="standard">
	Ai
nodded slowly. "It may be lost to me...but maybe it can be saved
for them."</p><p class="standard">
	</p><p class="standard">
	Mr.
Tanaka lived in Dubovy Drive South, near where Yumiko did. After the
excitement last night, Allen was still lying in bed with a case of
soda, a bag of chips, and stack of porn magazines, but Yuji had
gotten up early to go over and deliver the card before school. 
</p><p class="standard">
	Unlike
Yumiko, Tanaka lived in a house with its own garage and lawn. Parked
in the driveway was a Nissan minivan that Yuji assumed was the car he
was planning to let Allen ruin; Tanaka probably had a sports car
hidden in the garage, but no teenager would ever touch the thing.</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji
climbed the stairs onto the white porch and rang the doorbell. The
door opened, and his Japanese teacher nodded at him. "Mr.
Watanabe. Do you have the card?"</p><p class="standard">
	"Yes,"
said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">
	"Then
please come in. I was just about to have tea. Would you like some?"</p><p class="standard">
	"Thank
you."</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji
came in, removed his shoes, and passed into the living room. The
house was very open inside, with only the change from hardwood floors
to carpet marking the division between the entrance hall and the
living room. It was impeccably clean, unlike a house with young
children. Yuji sat down on the sofa and looked over the pictures and
knickknacks that lined the living room's two walls. He caught sight
of a photograph of a handsome man, a bit older than him, with black
hair and blue eyes. 
</p><p class="standard">
	Mr.
Tanaka returned with tea. "I apologize. My wife has already left
for work, and the tea isn't up to her standard, but I hope it will
suffice."</p><p class="standard">
	"Thank
you," said Yuji. He took a cup and sipped it, savoring the
flavor. As expected from a real Japanese, the tea had been brewed
from leaves and let steep for the perfect amount of time. "Is
that your son?" he asked, indicating the photograph of the
handsome man.</p><p class="standard">
	"Oh,
yes."</p><p class="standard">
	"He's
older than I thought."</p><p class="standard">
	"Yes,
he is too old for this absurd card game, but it means so much to him.
He'll be so happy that you've brought his card back for him."</p><p class="standard">
	"Is
he in college?" Yuji asked.</p><p class="standard">
	"Yes.
Just finished, actually. He's due to marry soon."</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji
nodded. He finished his tea, took the card out of his pocket, and
gave it to Mr. Tanaka. "Well, here you go. Thank you very much
for the tea, and for letting us borrow your car."</p><p class="standard">
	"I'll
bring it to school the day of the ball and let you and Mr. Sternheim
take it from there. It's not a very fashionable car, but it runs
well."</p><p class="standard">
	"Actually,
the extra space will be good; Mariko Takahashi and Ai Maeda are
planning to ride with us."</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji
couldn't tell if the teacher's eyes lit up when he heard Mariko's and
Ai's names or if he was seeing things.</p><p class="standard">
<br />
</p><p class="standard">
	"Thug
life," Yuji remarked, without really knowing why. He let his
gaze drift back to Miba and then, for the first time, he focused on
Mariko, willing her to get the message and spring her ambush.</p><p class="standard">
	She
did, lunging forward and knocking Miba flat on his face. At the same
moment, Yuji swatted away the arm holding the switchblade and thrust
his fingers into Shirley Temple's throat. Shirley Temple staggered,
and Yuji took hold of his arm and threw him down into an armlock,
twisting the knife out of his grasp as he did it.</p><p class="standard">
	He
saw Mariko come up alongside Miba and kick him in the ribs, and
feeling suddenly giddy, called, "See, Mariko? This is more fun
than a dance, isn't it?"</p><p class="standard">
	Mariko
shook her head. "I wanted my dance."</p><p class="standard">
	"You
can still get it. Just help me with this guy."</p><p class="standard">
	Mariko
came over, and he handed her the knife. "Keep away. If he
overpowers me, stick this in him."</p><p class="standard">
	"You
bastard, you human bastard!" Shirley Temple screamed.</p><p class="standard">
	The
noise wasn't going unnoticed; the prince and his mark had heard
something, but Yuji and Shirley Temple were still behind the
trashcans in the alley, so they couldn't see anything. Mariko
helpfully retrieved one of her high heels and shoved the toe as far
into Shirley Temple's mouth as it would go. Now they had to listen to
his gagging, but he couldn't scream anymore.</p><p class="standard">
	"I
want you to answer my questions with a nod for yes and a shake for
no," said Yuji. "If you do that, I won't break your arm.
Nod if you like that deal. Shake if you'd rather I break it."</p><p class="standard">
	Shirley
Temple chomped down on the shoe and thrashed, trying to escape, but
Yuji held on tight. He applied some pressure to show the curly-headed
boy how close his limb was to snapping, but Poodle-Head didn't get
the message and kept trying to wriggle free.</p><p class="standard">
	"Mariko,
give him a kick in the stomach," Yuji said.</p><p class="standard">
	Mariko
walked around his body and gave him a swift, but light kick in the
ribs. Yuji applied just a bit more pressure, but Shirley Temple
refused to see things his way.</p><p class="standard">
	"Listen,
you tamie," Mariko growled, "I didn't come to this dance to
yaru with some bollocks-biting kinky-headed alley rat. So you'd
better answer his <i>hracking</i> questions—" She gargled
the first letter of <i>hracking </i>in the back of her throat like a
German, "—and remember who's got the <i>hracking </i>knife
here."</p><p class="standard">
	"Did
Arishil send you?" Yuji demanded.</p><p class="standard">
	"The
princess? Why would she—?"</p><p class="standard">
	"Never
mind, Mariko, just keep the knife on him! Now nod or shake!"</p><p class="standard">
	Shirley
Temple, apparently realizing at last the position he was in, shook
his head.</p><p class="standard">
	"That's
a no," Mariko reported.</p><p class="standard">
	"Did
Miba attack the school on your orders?"</p><p class="standard">
	"That's
a no," said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">
	"Did
you attack me tonight because I knocked out Miba?"</p><p class="standard">
	"Another
no."</p><p class="standard">
	"Can
you speak if we take the shoe out of your mouth?"</p><p class="standard">
	"Another
no."</p><p class="standard">
	"Little
bastard. I'm tempted to break his arm just to put him out of our
misery," said Yuji. "I—"</p><p class="standard">
	He
stopped. He could hear the prince speaking to his mark on the
balcony.</p><p class="standard">
	"...splendor,
like nothing thou hast seen—palaces, balls, clothes and
jewelry, servants to wait upon thee...And for all this, I ask but one
honor: that thou consent to come my betrothed."</p><p class="standard">
	Mariko
had been listening as well, and Yuji saw that she too knew who the
prince was speaking with. "Did he just ask Ai to...Look out!"
Mariko suddenly leaped over Yuji and Shirley Temple, running at Miba.
Miba thrust his hands at her and seized her. She stood in place,
restrained by a blur in the air. At the same moment Shirley Temple
began thrashing again; Yuji struggled to hold him down, but he
finally managed to slip out of Yuji's grasp. Yuji tried to break his
limb, but he had already gotten too far out.</p><p class="standard">
	"Filthy
sheery taberu chinpo shaberu no!" spat the curly-headed boy.
"I'll keer your haha's oh-pai zay, I'll—"</p><p class="standard">
	"No,
Zakinthos!" said Miba. "This changes everything. I had no
idea she was with them!"</p><p class="standard">
	"I
don't care, Miba! I'll—"</p><p class="standard">
	"If
you do, and you screw up your uncle's plans, he won't be very happy
with you," said Miba.</p><p class="standard">
	Shirley
Temple growled at Yuji, then turned and left the alley. Miba released
Mariko and followed him.</p><p class="standard">
	Mariko's
eyes met Yuji's. They stared at each other for at least thirty
seconds, willing the other to have the answer to the question they
were both asking: <i>What the hell is going on?</i></p><p class="standard">
<i>	</i>Then
Mariko retrieved her shoes and strapped them back on. "You're
not going back on your promise, are you?"</p><p class="standard">
	"Huh?"
Yuji glanced up and noticed that the prince was now alone on the
balcony. Shirley Temple's screaming had drowned out Ai's reply, but
she'd managed to escape somehow.</p><p class="standard">
	"You're
still going to dance with me. At least once."</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji
shrugged, drained of all emotion. "Sure. But I can't dance, so
if we look like idiots or I step on your foot, know that you were
warned."</p><p class="standard">
<br />

        <p class="standard">	Lake
Hybrea was beautiful at dusk, as the orange rays of the dying sun
danced across its surface. The cherry trees had nearly finished
dropping their blooms onto the water, showing that spring was giving
way to summer.</p><p class="standard">	Usually,
he only noticed things like that when he was sitting and staring at
the lake in a depression, but now Yuji saw them for the opposite
reason: he was happy. Walking beside the lake with Mariko made him
feel that everything was all right, even though his life for the past
few months had been a series of disasters.</p><p class="standard">	"Okay,
so let me ask you this," Mariko was saying. "You're working
as an undercover cop. You do a heist with these guys, but since you
infiltrated their group, the heist goes to hell. You escape with them
afterward, but get shot in the stomach―"</p><p class="standard">	"Wait,
stop right there. So basically, I'm Mr. Orange," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Right.
So, you see Mr. Blonde pouring gas all over the cop he took hostage.
You have a choice: you can shoot Mr. Blonde, save the cop, and make
everybody suspicious. Or you can let Mr. Blonde kill the cop and keep
your cover. What do you do?"</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
get into that situation," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
come on! Just pretend."</p><p class="standard">	"What
is it with you and Allen and Tarantino?"</p><p class="standard">	"Tarantino?
I can't stand him!" said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?
Who do you think made <i>Reservoir
Dogs</i>?"
Yuji asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Martin
Scorsese."</p><p class="standard">	"No,
you're thinking of <i>Goodfellas</i>."</p><p class="standard">	"Guy
Ritchie."</p><p class="standard">	"Who?"

</p><p class="standard">	"Never
mind. Francis Ford Coppola."</p><p class="standard">	"<i>The

else did Tarantino make?" Mariko asked.</p><p class="standard">	"<i>Pulp

telling me the same man is responsible for those movies and <i>Reservoir

Ha ha, you almost had me!"</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
serious," said Yuji. 
</p><p class="standard">	"But
surely he didn't write it―"</p><p class="standard">	"Wrote,
directed, produced, and starred in," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
stopped walking to stare at him. "He starred in it?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
nodded. "He was Mr. Brown."</p><p class="standard">	"So
you're telling me that the man who made all those stupid movies with
no plot is also responsible for one of my favorite movies of all
time, and even appeared onscreen in this film, all without me ever
knowing it."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
laughed. "I don't know how it ever got past you."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
started walking again, her hand on her forehead. "Jeez. There
are so many frightening things to learn in this world."</p><p class="standard">	"When
I took Allen with me to get the card, he was all stuck on <i>Pulp
Fiction </i>and
how much we're like Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta. He kept
trying to recreate the conversations."</p><p class="standard">	"Who
was who?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
was Samuel L. Jackson and he was John Travolta."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
laughed. "Yeah, I can kind of see that. So, lemme tell you what
'Like a Virgin' is about."</p><p class="standard">	"Except
unlike Samuel L. Jackson, I never stop killing."</p><p class="standard">	"I
can't believe Mr. Tanaka made you guys do that," said Mariko.
"It was stupidly dangerous, and he could've lost his job."</p><p class="standard">	"He
was desperate. The card was worth hundreds of dollars, but the police
wouldn't do anything for him."</p><p class="standard">	"They
never do. They couldn't even keep Miba locked up."</p><p class="standard">	They
walked on in silence for a moment, then Mariko asked, "What's
Allen been up to, anyway? He's always racing off after school."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
he's volunteering at the youth center."</p><p class="standard">	There
was a moment of silence. "The youth center?" Mariko asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah."</p><p class="standard">	There
was another moment of silence. "Why is he volunteering at the
youth center?"</p><p class="standard">	"He
met someone at the ball. An older woman. Apparently she's―and
I'm paraphrasing―one hotsa hotsa humina humina bodaciously
brackish babe." 
</p><p class="standard">	"'Brackish'?
Does Allen even bother to look these words up before he uses them as
babe descriptors?"</p><p class="standard">	"She's
an older woman, so I guess if she's working at the youth center and
dating Allen, she must like babysitting."</p><p class="standard">	"So
does Allen have a shot? I mean, can he get there with her, in your
professional opinion as an expert on Allen," said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
he's got the right angle of entry, helping her out with her volunteer
work," said Yuji. "Now everything just depends on how easy
she is and how that coincides with Allen's tolerance for dealing with
kids. But after what he went through with Jolie, I'd say his
tolerance is high enough that any woman that'll sleep with a guy
after a month of normal dating is his. He doesn't want to wait,
though. He already pitched a plan to speed things up."</p><p class="standard">	"Some
sort of dumb scheme involving kidnapping her dog, like in that
terrible David Spade movie?"</p><p class="standard">	"Which
one? They were all terrible. So I guess she's planning to go to the
Outer Rim and put on a play for underprivileged children, and she
needs volunteers to star in it. Allen's planning to volunteer."</p><p class="standard">	"He
told you about this because he was asking you to volunteer too,
right?" said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"Uh
huh. I turned him down. The school is willing to give anyone who
volunteers a vacation week, but I shouldn't really be away from home
for that long."</p><p class="standard">	"The
volunteers have to sleep away from home?" Mariko asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
I guess some charity is paying for all the volunteers to stay in a
hotel in the Outer Rim and use the hotel's convention hall to put on
the show."</p><p class="standard">	"What
kind of hotel is this?"</p><p class="standard">	"A
damn good one, apparently. Four stars."</p><p class="standard">	"Let's
do it."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
stopped. "What?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
said, let's do it. Let's volunteer."</p><p class="standard">	"Why?"<br />	"Why
not? We get to stay in a four-star hotel for free, we can put it on
our college applications as community service, I can get away from my
mom and Manfred for a week, and we get to help Allen realize all his
hopes and dreams. Where's the bad?"</p><p class="standard">	"It's
amazing how you can see the good in anything."</p><p class="standard">	"It's
not hard, in this case."</p><p class="standard">	They
passed on in silence for a time, watching the blossoms drift across
the lake and the lights of the mall across the water. Yuji wondered
if Yumiko was working tonight, and if she and Akari had ever made up,
and if Akari really had engineered the entire scheme to drive Yumiko
to suicide, as Ai believed.</p><p class="standard">	As
if she'd had the same thought, Mariko said, "Akari is living
with Ai again. Guess the bitch ran out of patience."</p><p class="standard">	"She
can't just keep yo-yo-ing between her mother's and Ai's. She's going
to have to go home for good at some point."</p><p class="standard">	"Especially
if Ai gets married," said Mariko. "I mean, the guy meets
her, and twenty minutes later he proposes marriage! It's like Romeo
and Juliet or some cac."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
how they do it over there. If the prince sees a girl he wants, he has
to marry her. He has to be married to get a mistress, which he'll do
as soon as he gets tired of her."</p><p class="standard">	"D'you
suppose she'll say yes?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't know."</p><p class="standard">	"Maybe
we should talk to her. Give her the benefit of our experience."</p><p class="standard">	"What
experience?" asked Yuji. "We've both had sex one time.
You've had three boyfriends, so maybe you've got something, but I've
never had a girlfriend in my life. I don't have any experience."</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
maybe just the benefit of an outside view. I mean, she's young. She's
never had a boyfriend, never worked a job. I just don't want her to
get caught up in the idea of being a princess and being rich and
never having to work and then get herself stuck in some quicksand
marriage."</p><p class="standard">	"She
can do whatever she wants this time," said Yuji. "I helped
her when she got stuck with Butch. If you want to talk to her, go
ahead, but I'm not going to do anything. It's up to her."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
so typical of you," Mariko laughed. "Well, do what you
like. Doesn't the water look really nice?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,"
Yuji agreed.</p><p class="standard">	"Come
on, let's go for a swim."</p><p class="standard">	"Right
now? We don't have bathing suits...and doesn't the mall charge people
to swim?"</p><p class="standard">	"It's
getting dark. No one will see us."</p><p class="standard">	"No,
I don't really feel like it."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
sighed. "Well, all right."</p><p class="standard">	"It
still puzzles me," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"What?"</p><p class="standard">	"Why
are you going out with me? I'm not exactly the life of the party.
You'd have more fun with someone else."</p><p class="standard">	"Why
is Allen going out with an older woman? Why is Akari always babbling
about her pure yuri love for Ai?" Mariko smiled. "<i>Le
cœur a raison que la raison ne connaît point.</i>"</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	She
had worn the same black dress as the night of the ball, but Yuji
didn't mind; he had barely noticed her that night, with everything
that had been going on, but now he had a chance to admire how it
followed every curve, how it accented her figure. He took a glance
around the restaurant, softly lit with candlelight and filled with
well-dressed people, so different from any restaurant he'd ever been
inside. The low buzz of quiet conversation and the scents of
hundred-thousand dollar perfume, the lemon slices in the glasses of
water, and the basket of gardenias on each table filled the room.
Waiters and waitresses shuffled across the maroon carpet, pouring out
wine that cost more than Yuji's house for diners who glittered with
diamonds and gold. Then he returned his gaze to Mariko, and even she
looked like something otherworldly, something beyond his reach.</p><p class="standard">	"That
was insane!" she said, reaching for the glass of water the
waiter had brought. "I was so embarrassed, I thought I'd just
shake myself apart."</p><p class="standard">	It
took Yuji a moment to realize that she was talking about the play.
"Oh, yeah. You came out looking pretty good. The rest of us were
terrible."</p><p class="standard">	"Are
you kidding? I had a wardrobe malfunction!"</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
but most of the audience were kids."</p><p class="standard">	"They
were laughing at me!"</p><p class="standard">	"You
were wearing shorts, and anyway, that was the only positive reaction
that terrible play got. You're the only one they applauded without
being ordered to when we all took a bow."</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
you'd think a bunch of poor kids would be a little more grateful.
Especially since there's no TV out here," said Mariko. Even the
hotel didn't have TV, though it was one of the few buildings on the
island that had electricity. The palace of Van's cousin, Princess
Terra Wahaca Manoa Nunavut Theonia Oakenbrand, ruler of the
Principality of Clarissia, was another one. "You're right,
though, it could've been worse for me. Poor Ai."</p><p class="standard">	"She
did a good job ad-libbing, other than the delivery," said Yuji.
"During the whole 'meaning of life' conversation we had in that
one scene, I couldn't stop laughing. I had to bite my tongue."</p><p class="standard">	"I
know! It was so meaningless that changing it to a conversation about
hot dogs hardly affected anything. Akari didn't get it. She kept
asking me why I was laughing so hard. She forgot most of her lines
too."</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't think she reads English very well, so she probably didn't look
at the script very much," said Yuji. 
</p><p class="standard">	"That's
strange, she speaks it fine."</p><p class="standard">	"She
kept on asking me to read words for her. I must've read 'straight'
for her twelve times. She couldn't grasp that it wasn't 'straig-hot'.
She told me her grandfather spoke English at home, but all her
reading was in Japanese," said Yuji. 
</p><p class="standard">	"We
could get her some manga in English. Maybe she'd actually read them,"
said Mariko. "By the way, Princess Arishil's kids were pretty
good."</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
they were."</p><p class="standard">	"Why
did she send them, do you think?"</p><p class="standard">	"Dunno.
I guess to get close to me," said Yuji. "It didn't work,
though; the boy starts acting like Ai every time I look at him, and
the girl hisses at me like a wounded cat whenever she sees me." 
</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
still confused about all this: Princess Arishil is the ruler of this
group of superpowered beings, basically like Professor Xavier in
X-Men, and she thinks that if she has your babies, they'll be
mega-powerful?"</p><p class="standard">	"Pretty
much," said Yuji. "By the way, you just imagined me
sleeping with Patrick Stewart, didn't you?"</p><p class="standard">	"No!
I'm not Akari. I won't say the thought never crossed my mind...but I
didn't imagine it. But if a doujinshi with that theme happens to
appear at the next SaComi, I had nothing to do with it. I didn't even
offhandedly mention the idea to Akari."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
sighed. He was rescued from having to make a reply by the waiter, who
arrived with a bottle of the restaurant's cheapest wine, which was
still cost more than the yearly salary of preschool teacher, and two
plates of appetizers. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Here-a
you go, sir-a, madam-a," said the waiter, setting out two
glasses and pouring for them. He spoke with the accent of the local
language, rolling both his <i>r's
</i>and
his cadence. In the whole week, Yuji had been unable to get anyone to
tell him anything about the language other than that it was hideous,
barbaric, and only spoken by criminals and filthy peasants; everyone
in the hotel and in town spoke English, most of them with a perfect
British or American accent. He didn't even know what the native
language was called, other than 'gibberish' or 'crunch'. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Is
everything-a satisfactory?" the waiter asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
perfectly," said Mariko. "Thank you."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
nodded his thanks and took his glass, as well as the menu the waiter
handed him. The waiter left, and Yuji tasted the wine. He didn't know
much about wine, but it seemed far too good to be the cheap stuff; it
had a light, floral taste that made him think of the lakeside a week
ago, when Mariko had talked him into coming here, and watching the
pink blossoms float across the orange-hued water. "Why are you
going out with me?" he asked again.</p><p class="standard">	"Like
I said before: <i>le
cœur a raison que la raison ne connaît point</i>.
But if you're going to keep asking me that, I have to ask you: why
are you going out with me? You were so resistant to it before."</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
it just seemed like the thing to do. We get along well. Allen thought
maybe I'd have fun with you."</p><p class="standard">	"You
discussed this with Allen?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
took another sip of wine. He was already starting to feel it, a
little. "Are you mad?" he asked.</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
not mad, just startled. With Allen's track record, I can't believe
you'd trust his advice."</p><p class="standard">	"Fair
point," said Yuji. "Maybe he just gave me a reason to do
something I wanted to do anyway. Don't think about it too much; if I
didn't want to date you, I wouldn't be."</p><p class="standard">	They
both took a moment to look at the menu and eat a few appetizers. Yuji
tried a slice of grilled fruit with a shrimp on top and found it very
good; the fruit had been grilled just enough to give it some smoky
depth, and the shrimp was very tender. He checked the menu, which had
been printed in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and
Latin. The font used for the names of the dishes was so curly and
stylized that Yuji had trouble figuring it out. 
</p><p class="standard">	"What
are you getting?" he asked Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't know, I can't read anything," she replied. "This
sounds good, this tilapia dish...what does that say?"</p><p class="standard">	"It
looks like 'Miapya ao vhilwen'," said Yuji. 
</p><p class="standard">	"You
think so? I can't even tell what language that is."</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
just point to it, he'll figure it out."</p><p class="standard">	They
managed, through pointing at the menu, to order the tilapia for
Mariko and the calamari for Yuji. The wait was quite short, and when
he returned, the waiter poured each of them another glass of wine and
instructed them to call if there was anything missing.</p><p class="standard">	For
a while, they didn't speak, enjoying the most expensive meal they
were likely to ever have. If not for Ishinobu letting them use her
expense account with the charity, they would've had to take out a
mortgage to eat in this restaurant. She had also paid to rent Yuji's
tuxedo. 
</p><p class="standard">	Finally
the meal had finished; the first bottle of wine was gone and they
were into a bottle of dessert wine, waiting for a slice of cheesecake
and a lemon-mint sorbet. Yuji was definitely feeling the wine now,
and he could tell Mariko was too; she had become a bit red in the
face, and was sitting lower in her chair than when she had started
the evening. 
</p><p class="standard">	"This
is what I want to know," said Mariko suddenly. "Actually,
two things." Her speech was quicker and more blurred than usual,
but Yuji could still make out what she was saying. "First of
all, why did you pass up the chance to go live in a tree and sleep
with a princess forever? Was she ugly or something?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
smiled and shook his head. "No, she was beautiful. To tell you
the truth, I was overawed by her from the second I saw her. But she
seemed kind as well...and sad."</p><p class="standard">	"Then
why?"</p><p class="standard">	"Because
she wanted me to be a baby again. She wanted me to live in her tree
and be waited on hand and foot, with nothing to do but please her.
That might be nice for a little while, but before long I'd get bored.
I'd have no one to talk to, no one to give doujinshi or go to the
arcade with or anything like that."</p><p class="standard">	"Then
it wasn't because you love me, or Ai; it was because you love Allen?"
Mariko asked.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
laughed. "I guess you could say that. Plus, her henchmen rubbed
me the wrong way. First they tried to trick me into coming, then they
tried to take me by force. I wasn't happy about that."</p><p class="standard">	"Okay,
but she accepted your decision and let you go, right? So why did you
go meet her at the ball?"</p><p class="standard">	"She
didn't accept it," said Yuji. "She only let me go as long
as I agreed to meet her again. I think she just decided to change her
approach. You catch more flies with honey than vinegar, that sort of
thing."</p><p class="standard">	"And
what did she say to you when you met her? And why did Ai go with
you?"</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
uh..." Yuji wondered briefly if Mariko was pretending to be
drunk to get this information out of him, but she was definitely
affected; he'd sat right here and watched her drink three glasses of
wine. "Ai came because she was with me the first time and
Arishil kind of took a liking to her. I told her to go home, but she
insisted." Not wanting to parade that Ai was an esper, he'd made
it sound as though he'd broken through Rebecca's enchantment and
defeated Jinjo and Mirufa on his own. 
</p><p class="standard">	"And
what did Arishil tell you?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
was about to speak, though he had no idea what he was going to say,
when they were interrupted by Ishinobu, the director of the play and
Allen's current girlfriend, with a teenage girl Yuji didn't
recognize.</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji!
Mariko! So glad you enjoy are date!" she exclaimed, entering
with her usual flurry of arm-waving and bad English. It was easy to
see why Allen was going out with her: she was beautiful, with
light-brown eyes and silky purple hair that reached her waist, and
she had a very buxom figure that tended to move around a lot inside
her clothes when she got into a flurry of enthusiasm, which was
often. She was also an elf, which explained why most of the children
who had attended the play had also been elves. "For all week, I
have not idea that you are dating! I think is nice if let youse enjoy
hotel restaurant for last weekend of play!"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
thank you," said Yuji, bowing his head. "We really
appreciate it."</p><p class="standard">	"Sure
do," said Mariko. 
</p><p class="standard">	"This
is the Kanako Ichihara, who writes play we perform," said
Ishinobu, indicating her companion. "She is of Sakura Memorial
like youse, and volunteers for write play." Kanako was taller
than Yuji, though she was probably only fifteen years old, and very
thin. Her nose was very high and long, as if she had a habit of
turning it up that had resulted in a permanently turned-up state. She
wore a gray hooded pullover and tight jeans, and her gait was
slightly pigeon-toed. 
</p><p class="standard">	"So,
you're responsible for that mess," said Mariko. Yuji slapped
himself in the forehead. He wondered if it was because she was drunk
or just because she was Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"What's
that supposed to mean?" said Kanako.</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
mind her, she's had a few too many glasses of wine," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"It
means your play was terrible. It was <i>execrable</i>."</p><p class="standard">	"What
was wrong with it?" Kanako demanded, a note of panic in her
voice.</p><p class="standard">	"Everything!
The setting didn't make any sense, the dialogue was godawful, the
characters were all bastards, and every other word had to be
translated out of French so the interpreter could put it into Elvish
for the audience of elvish children we were playing for. A few words
like 'chateau' and 'menage à trois' are fine, but I almost
killed myself when I found out I'd have to say 'Oh <i>mon
cher! </i>Please
put your <i>cuiller
en </i>my
<i>café!
</i>Oh!
I feel that <i>vient-il
le petit mors</i>!'
We had to cut that, by the way, since we were playing to an audience
of children. We replaced it with a scene where Monsieur Zonard and
Mesdames Damriche and Nonvierge play a heated game of Monopoly."</p><p class="standard">	"M-my
friends all said it was really good, and...and you just don't
understand French literature!" Kanako screamed. Some of the
other diners looked up, and the waiter was already gliding over. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Madame,
I must ask-a you to leave if-a you cannot avoid-a disturbing the
other-a diners," he said.</p><p class="standard">	"Fine,
I'll leave...I'll leave this earth..." Kanako whimpered,
cradling her face in her hands. Yuji couldn't tell if she was
actually crying or faking it, but she did leave the restaurant, her
face in her hands the whole way out.</p><p class="standard">	"I
apologize," said the waiter. "Is everything-a
satisfactory?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
perfectly," said Mariko, beaming at him.</p><p class="standard">	"Very
good. Let-a me go check on-a your-a desserts."</p><p class="standard">	With
Kanako gone, Ishinobu took a chair from another table and sat down.
"I may have glass of wine?" she asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Go
ahead; Mariko's had more than enough," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Had
to do it," said Mariko. "Would've regretted it forever if I
hadn't."</p><p class="standard">	Ishinobu
didn't seem at all bothered by Mariko's behavior, but Yuji didn't
think this was because she agreed with Mariko; he chalked it up more
to general obliviousness. She drained Mariko's glass and poured
herself another. "I bring Kanako here for tomorrow. Like say at
weekstart, now play is over we visit village from where children
come. Want everyone come. Village is very dirty and has no money, we
help them very much by give child play, give child food and clothes."
She smiled at Yuji. "You very good give children shirt."</p><p class="standard">	"It
was nothing," said Yuji; the entire cast of the play had spent
three hours after the performance in the hotel's convention hall
handing out sacks of rice and flour and T-shirts, underwear, and
tracksuits with the logo of The Melissa da Medinero Foundation, one
of the foremost charities in America, on them.</p><p class="standard">	"We
have other guest for tomorrow, prince on Montagria is coming! He
brings reporter who tells everyone that inside elf village is bad. I
hope others give help after see it."</p><p class="standard">	"I
hope it isn't rude to ask this," said Yuji, "but aren't
there companies run by elves out here in the Outer Rim that do pretty
good business? Why don't they help?"</p><p class="standard">	"Other
elf runs them. Two kind of elf. One kind is Snow Elf. I'm Snow Elf.
Snow Elf speaks one language, looks little bit different. Has dark
hair, not so tall. Other elf is Valley Elf. Calls itself High Elf,
speaks different language, looks little bit different. Has yellow
hair, more tall. Valley Elf has company. Valley Elf helps Valley Elf
village. This is Snow Elf village. Snow Elf must help Snow Elf
village. Understand?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
nodded. "Yes, I understand. I'm sorry I asked."</p><p class="standard">	"You
have not sorry. Only learn if ask. I'm happy that youse help me. I
have very fun! Like to put play with youse for elf child, even if
play bad. I'm happy that I meet Allen at prince's house. Happen very
good."</p><p class="standard">	The
waiter returned with their desserts, and Ishinobu excused herself.
"We all meet in front of hotel tomorrow morning nine!" she
said. "Good night!"</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
took the chocolate wafer out of her cheesecake and ate it first, then
dug in to the slice with a spoon. "Y'know, she's not too bright,
but she's a good person," she said.</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,"
Yuji agreed. "I feel bad that Allen is tricking her like this."</p><p class="standard">	"Allen,
tricking her? God, no. She isn't that dim. Either she played him to
get volunteers, or she likes babysitting, if you know what I mean."</p><p class="standard">	They
finished their desserts and the waiter presented the check. The
dinner had been prepaid from the account, so it was more of a
formality, but Yuji scanned the receipt and cringed; altogether, the
dinner had come to over a thousand dollars.</p><p class="standard">	"Jeez,
it's like a visit to the dentist," he said, reaching into his
pocket for his wallet. "What's fifteen percent of one thousand,
two hundred and forty-five dollars and fourteen cents?"</p><p class="standard">	"Twenty
bucks," said Mariko, throwing a ten onto the table.</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
pretty sure it's―"</p><p class="standard">	"It's
twenty bucks," said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
put his ten on top of hers. He had a feeling he would never be in a
restaurant of this caliber again, and certainly not in this specific
restaurant, for the waiters to snub him.</p><p class="standard">	When
they passed into the lobby, Yuji glanced at the huge clock above the
main entrance and saw that it was past ten o' clock. The lobby was
mostly empty, except for a few people going to and from other areas
of the hotel, a couple servants going to clean the rooms, and a night
guard sitting behind the front desk.</p><p class="standard">	As
they crossed the lobby towards the elevators, Mariko suddenly
stumbled and broke the heel off her shoe. Yuji caught her before she
fell, mostly because he happened to be standing in the way. "Oh,
bugger. They survive a run-in with Miba, but the hotel lobby is too
much for them."</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
at least we're inside," said Yuji. He collected the heel and
handed it to her. "You can make it back to your room."</p><p class="standard">	"My
room? Hey, you wanna do it...in my room?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
think you're drunk."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
ahead of you there: I know I'm drunk."</p><p class="standard">	"And
I think you'll pass out before we can do anything," said Yuji.
"And if you don't, I will. So let's leave it for another night."</p><p class="standard">	"'Kay.
Just transportation, then, no special services."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
pressed the button for the fifth floor, where Mariko's room was. His
own room was also on this floor, but the others had their rooms on
the sixth floor. He waited, acutely aware of Mariko's arms around his
neck. He liked the feeling; Mariko's arms were quite solid for a
girl's, much stronger and thicker than Ai's or Akari's, but still
with a tenderness to them. 
</p><p class="standard">	The
elevator reached the fifth floor and Yuji helped Mariko to step out
into the hall. "Your room is 515, right?"</p><p class="standard">	"My
room is wherever you want it to be," said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"Jeez,
you really are drunk. You're starting to sound like the characters in
that play."</p><p class="standard">	"I
resent that. I could never, in my drunkest moment, be anything like
anything invented by that hack Kanako."</p><p class="standard">	"Anyway,
here's your room." Yuji took the key out of his pocket; he had
both their keys, since Mariko's dress didn't have pockets. He stuck
it in the keyhole, turned it, and then tried to turn the knob. The
knob wouldn't turn.</p><p class="standard">	"Jiggle
it," Mariko suggested. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
did, and nothing happened.</p><p class="standard">	"Jiggle
me," Mariko suggested.</p><p class="standard">	"That
won't help." He turned the key again, around and around, finding
that it could turn three hundred and sixty degrees in the keyhole. He
took the key out and tried the door again. It opened.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
sighed. "Why can't we just have card keys?"</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
stumbled into the doorway. "Thank you. I had fun. Especially
skewering Kanako." She leaned over and kissed him the cheek.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
actually smiled. "Yeah. Me too. Good night."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
shut the door and left Yuji alone in the hall. Yuji went down the
hall and around the corner to his own room, Room 526. None of the
rooms they'd been given had minibars, or even windows, but all of
them were large, carpeted in white, with exquisite handmade furniture
and all the room service they wanted. Yuji knew Akari had been
stuffing herself on banana cream pie for the past few days; it wasn't
a dessert that was eaten much in Japan, and she'd never had it
before.</p><p class="standard">	Back
in his room, Yuji undressed and put the tuxedo in its bag in the
closet. He put on his pajamas and tumbled into bed without brushing
his teeth. He closed his eyes and quickly fell asleep, his cheek
still feeling warm where Mariko had kissed him.</p><p class="standard">	A
few minutes later, he got up again. The room was completely dark. The
entire hotel lay still as graveyard. Yuji threw off the blankets and
rose, feeling a feverish heat over his body. He wiped a bead of sweat
from his forehead and went towards the door. He didn't know how he
knew it was the door, but as soon as he got there he reached out for
the brass doorknob and opened it. 
</p><p class="standard">	The
halls were flooded with the silver light of a full moon. Yuji
stumbled down them like a man dying of thirst in the desert, the heat
pulsing in all his joints, towards Mariko's room. He opened the door
easily, without even having to jiggle the key in the keyhole. 
</p><p class="standard">	He
staggered through the black to Mariko's bedside. A shaft of light
from the open door fell across her, illuminating her features. She
lay there, a white nightgown hugging the curves of her body, sleeping
in peace. Yuji admired her body through the gown for a moment. 
</p><p class="standard">	He
suddenly became aware that he was holding something. He lifted it
into the light to examine it. It was a long chef's knife, probably
from the kitchen. The blade was twenty centimeters, with a sharp tip.

</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
hefted the knife and climbed up onto Mariko's bed, straddling her
legs. He took hold of the front of her nightgown and pulled it down,
exposing her breasts. He admired their gentle curves, then ran the
back of his hand across her left breast and felt its softness, its
tenderness. Then he raised the knife and plunged it into her breasts
until they were bloody shreds. He felt warm liquid flow across his
hand.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	"What's
wrong?" Mariko asked. "You've been quiet all morning."</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?
Oh, just a little hung over from last night," Yuji lied.</p><p class="standard">	They
were sitting in a huge van that the hotel had loaned them in order to
drive the seven miles to the elven village. The hotel had also loaned
them the driver, a maid who looked about seventeen, though she was
very short. She had met them in front of the hotel that morning
without a word beyond "Follow me" and now she was
transporting them in the same manner.</p><p class="standard">	The
van had space for fifteen, if everyone moved in close. At thirteen,
including the maid, their group nearly reached the limit. Yuji,
Mariko, and Arishil's two children Sishica and Rekka were seated in
the first row. They were nine-year-old twins: Rekka red-haired,
blue-eyed, and prone to pouting, and her brother Sishica also
red-haired and blue-eyed, but careful with his eye contact. When
Rekka moved, she was very sure of herself, as if she had fine control
over every movement her body made. Sishica was less sure of himself,
and liked to stick close to his sister whenever he could.
Nonetheless, he had performed very well in the play, moving and
saying his lines in his part as a Parisian street urchin as if he
didn't even realize how ridiculous the things he was saying were.</p><p class="standard">	In
the second row were Ai and Akari. Ai had worn jeans and a blouse
instead of her usual skirt, and Akari had copied her. The prince had
also insinuated himself into that row, and he and Akari kept on
speaking over each other, trying to capture Ai's attention. The
prince also had a journalist from his homeland and a bodyguard along
for the ride; the journalist was sitting next to the prince and
snapping pictures of him and of Ai, while the bodyguard was in the
last row looking annoyed at having to sit with Kanako, who seemed to
be checking him out, and Ishinobu and Allen, who were chattering away
as if they were alone.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
watched the surroundings change as they drove, from the stone streets
of Clarissia City to the dirt roads of the town's outskirts. "I
had a strange dream last night," he said.</p><p class="standard">	"A
nightmare? A scary-wary nightmare?" Mariko teased.</p><p class="standard">	"No...I
dreamed I was killing you."</p><p class="standard">	"All
right, all right, tell me about the dream."</p><p class="standard">	"That
was the dream," said Yuji. "I dreamed I was killing you.
And enjoying it."</p><p class="standard">	"Look,
I'm sorry, so just tell me what the dream was about―"</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
serious, that was it. It wasn't the first time, either. I've been
having them all week. I had a similar dream a few days ago, and then
one about Princess Arishil―"</p><p class="standard">	"Peh!"
Rekka scoffed. "You, kill my mother? In your―!"</p><p class="standard">	"Dreams?"
Mariko interrupted.</p><p class="standard">	Rekka
sniffed and looked away. "Sishica, did you hear something? I
thought I heard a human speak!"</p><p class="standard">	"S-sister,
please try to be..." Sishica mumbled.</p><p class="standard">	"Be
what? Enthusiastic? How can I be? This vehicle is filled with the
stench of lower creatures."</p><p class="standard">	"Hey,
you may be some bigshot where you come from, but to me you're just a
brat!" Mariko said. "No one asked you to come. You just
showed up and started acting like a little galla."</p><p class="standard">	"You're
nothing but an ape who―"</p><p class="standard">	"Whaddya
mean? Are you saying I'm a rhino who crashes through the underbrush?
An elephant who's so huge it takes a helicopter to move me? A whale
that―"</p><p class="standard">	"Mariko,"
Yuji said, "you're fighting with a child."</p><p class="standard">	"She's
a rude little bitch!" Mariko snarled. "I oughta show her
what we humans do to kids who act like that!"</p><p class="standard">	"Go
ahead and try; killing you will be a pleasure," said Rekka.</p><p class="standard">	"Both
of you stop!" said Yuji. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
you order me around!" Rekka snapped. "I don't think much of
you at all, Yuji Watanabe. You're certainly no Irlumarmitpa. As a
matter of fact, my mother has four other suspected Irlumarmitpa being
monitored at this very moment, and you're lowest on her list; she
only sent Sishica and I here as a favor to the Snow Elven community."</p><p class="standard">	"Sister..."
Sishica mumbled.</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
okay with that," said Yuji. "I don't want to be the
Irlumarmitpa. Nothing sounds more tedious."</p><p class="standard">	Rekka
opened her mouth like she was going to say something, and when words
failed her, closed it and turned forward in a huff. 
</p><p class="standard">	After
several minutes of watching dirt and tufts of grass go by outside,
the van began to slow down. It came to a stop in front of a high
metal fence topped with rolls and rolls of barbed wire.</p><p class="standard">	After
a moment, a man with a military disposition came up alongside the
driver's side door and tapped on the window with the tip of his
spear. The maid cranked it down and stared at him.</p><p class="standard">	"Name?"
he said.</p><p class="standard">	"Hanami."</p><p class="standard">	"Full
name?"</p><p class="standard">	"Just
Hanami."</p><p class="standard">	"Who're
all these people?"</p><p class="standard">	"Visitors."</p><p class="standard">	"Who
said they could visit?"</p><p class="standard">	"Princess
Terra."</p><p class="standard">	The
prince got out of his seat and came to stand alongside the first row.
"I, Prince Vanadiel Thaddeus Egwimphron of Montagria, under the
power given me by my cousin, Princess Terra Theonia Oakenbrand of
Clarissia, do hereby command that you open these gates and allow this
vehicle passage immediately!"</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
immediately, he says," Rekka muttered under her breath. Yuji
couldn't help smiling.</p><p class="standard">	The
military man straightened up like he'd been electrocuted. "Oh,
gor! Dint see you there, your lordship. Sorry for the inconvenience.
Please go on." He waved them on through the gates.</p><p class="standard">	Outside
the gates, there was no sign at all of human habitation. The first
thing Yuji saw after they drove through the gates was a pile of
garbage. Scraps of wood, bits of metal, tin cans, potato skins,
banana peels, and empty sacks baked under the morning sun. Beyond the
piles of garbage stood a clutch of shacks made from corrugated metal,
plywood, and straw. Yuji saw that people were already starting to
come out and see what was going on.</p><p class="standard">	The
maid pulled over the van next to a heap of broken boards stuck full
of rusty nails. "Time to get out," she said.</p><p class="standard">	Sishica
was first out, followed by his sister, Mariko, and Yuji. The others
followed, taking a moment to stretch out after the car ride and then
milling off in groups: Van and Akari followed Ai, Van's entourage
followed Van, and Kanako followed Van's bodyguard, giving Mariko a
dirty look as she passed. Allen and Ishinobu also wandered off on
their own, so that by the time the maid said in her low, emotionless
voice, "Everyone please stay together", Yuji, Mariko, and
the twins were the only ones near enough to hear.</p><p class="standard">	"Then,
please stay with me," she said to them.</p><p class="standard">	"Is
it dangerous here?" Mariko asked. Rekka sniffed.</p><p class="standard">	"No,
it should not be. But they do not speak your language."</p><p class="standard">	"They'll
speak my language," Rekka bragged.</p><p class="standard">	"Sister,
maybe we should listen to her," said Sishica.</p><p class="standard">	"I'll
stay with you! But remember, you're the ones who need me, not the
other way around," Rekka snapped.</p><p class="standard">	"Where
would you like to go?" the maid asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
why don't you just show us around the entire place," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Understood."</p><p class="standard">	The
area where they were parked appeared to be something like a town
square; it was clear of garbage and huts, and the elves had put a
stone carved with moons and stars and other symbols at the center. On
the far side was a wooden building with sides of meat hung behind
actual glass windows, and tables overflowing with trinkets on the
front porch. 
</p><p class="standard">	Many
of them were coming out of their huts to see what the fuss was. Rekka
called out to them in Elvish. A male elf, very broad-shouldered and
with a head of grey hair, came through the crowd and replied in the
same language.</p><p class="standard">	"He
says he is ashamed," said the maid.</p><p class="standard">	"Ashamed?
Why?" asked Mariko, but Yuji thought he knew why.</p><p class="standard">	"He's
ashamed to show us that they live like this," he said.</p><p class="standard">	"Why?
That isn't their fault."</p><p class="standard">	"Mr.
Watanabe is correct, Miss Takahashi," said Sishica. "Snow
Elves value hospitality. They're ashamed that they can't return the
hospitality we showed them at the hotel in kind."</p><p class="standard">	Rekka
spoke again in Elvish, then motioned to the maid, who spoke with the
male elf. Sishica translated for them. "His name is Gazha. He is
the head of the village. He welcomes us and offers us his
hospitality, such as it is."</p><p class="standard">	"Would
you like to go to his house?" the maid asked. "He offers
refreshment."</p><p class="standard">	"Let's
go," said Mariko. "I want to try elven food!"</p><p class="standard">	The
five of them followed Gazha as he weaved between the huts, finding
the path that led where he wanted. Rekka and Gazha kept talking in
Elvish as they went. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Would
you like to know what my sister is saying, Mr. Watanabe?"
Sishica asked.</p><p class="standard">	"You're
strangely talkative today," Mariko commented. She was right; for
the past week, he had hardly said three words to any of them, and
always blushed and looked away if Yuji even looked at him, just like
Ai. He was even doing it now, blushing and not responding to Mariko.
"Sorry, I didn't mean anything by it," she said.</p><p class="standard">	"No,
I apologize. But, Mr. Watanabe?"</p><p class="standard">	"No,
I want to ask you some questions. Some elves own companies, or work
alongside other species like Ishinobu or the two that work for
Arishil. Why can't these ones do that? Why can't they find some way
to leave this place?"</p><p class="standard">	Sishica
blushed deeper. "A-as for Ishinobu, she is one who found a way
to leave a village very much like this. Jinjo Rojinjo and Mirufa
Lumbil, who were acquaintances of hers long ago, helped her to do it.
But most of them cannot leave. They have no nation of their own kind
to go to, and many of them speak no human language, as you've seen,
and cannot learn one, since books are hard to find here."</p><p class="standard">	"Can't
they go to the city and find work?" Mariko asked. "Even
humans have to find work in places where they don't speak the
language."</p><p class="standard">	"The
royal family keeps them confined here," said the maid.</p><p class="standard">	"Why?"
Mariko asked.</p><p class="standard">	"They
are dangerous. They have rebelled in the past. Further in the past,
they were the rulers. They kept humans confined. The ancestors of our
royal family freed the humans."</p><p class="standard">	"And
you're okay with this?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
do not have an opinion either way."</p><p class="standard">	"What
is it that makes them so dangerous?" asked Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	The
maid didn't answer. It was Sishica who responded. "Like my
people, the elves are not natives of the Outer Rim. They came here in
exile from somewhere else, and brought with them weapons and
technology far beyond that of the people they found here. Because of
that, they came to rule a human population. When the ancestors of the
Montagrian royal family defeated the elves, they took all the
advanced technology and destroyed it."</p><p class="standard">	"They
didn't use it?" Yuji asked.</p><p class="standard">	"They
could not," said the maid.</p><p class="standard">	"Elven
technology can only be used by elves," said Sishica.  "Much
of it ended up at the bottom of the sea, but some ended up in scrap
heaps, where the elves found it and reassembled it. Elves are
long-lived, and there are those who were alive in those times and
were taught the workings of elven technology by their parents, and
make it from whatever material they can find. But of course, the
royal family doesn't want them gaining the ability to rebel, so they
send the military every so often to raid the villages and find any
technology the elves are hiding. Even human devices from your people
are not allowed."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
thought of the guard at the gate, with his spear. The prince was
always carrying a sword. Yuji had thought that was mostly an
affectation, but it seemed that Montagria and the other Outer Rim
kingdoms were at a level of technology lower than most third-world
countries. 
</p><p class="standard">	Gazha's
hut was made mostly from driftwood and cardboard, and thatched with
plastic rice sacks, like a garbage tent. The land the camp sat on
seemed fertile enough, but there weren't many big trees, so finding
lumber was probably a challenge for the elves. "Are they allowed
to have tools, like axes and hammers?" he asked Sishica.</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
but they have no way of getting them other than by bargaining with
whomever happens to pass through," said Sishica. "Furnaces
and smithies are forbidden; they can be used to make weapons."</p><p class="standard">	Gazha
led them underneath an awning made of old PVC pipe and more plastic
rice sacks and indicated for them to sit. They did, in a ring on the
grass, and Gazha called something in Elvish towards the house. A
female elf appeared, passed a few words with Gazha, and then went
back into the house.</p><p class="standard">	"One
of his wives," said Sishica. "He likely has two or three,
and each may have other lovers. Snow Elves are very free when it
comes to love. Um, um..." He faltered. "You know, Mr.
Watanabe, when my mother found the Snow Elves living in such a state,
she allowed many of them to leave the human lands and settle on our
islands."</p><p class="standard">	"Is
that so."</p><p class="standard">	"Y-yes...Thanks
to Mother, they have been able to reestablish something of the
civilization they had before being exiled."</p><p class="standard">	Gazha's
wife came out with a tray of tea and small cakes. She knelt down,
placed it directly in the center of their circle, and then said
something in Elvish.</p><p class="standard">	"She
speaks the ritual greeting, asking us to partake of her hospitality,"
said Sishica. "We may eat now."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
took a cup of tea and handed it to Mariko, then took another for
himself. He sniffed it; it smelled a lot like chamomile. He took a
sip. It tasted a lot like chamomile. Not his favorite, but he wasn't
going to insult his host by not drinking it.</p><p class="standard">	"Try
the cake," said Mariko, holding it up. Yuji went to take it, but
she snatched it away. "No, open your mouth."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
opened his mouth and Mariko popped it in. The cake was much better
than the tea; it had a delicious sesame taste to it. "Not bad,"
he said.</p><p class="standard">	Gazha's
wife and Sishica began to talk in Elvish. Gazha remained by Rekka's
side and spoke with her. Yuji saw Mariko looking at the maid, who was
sipping a cup of tea, sitting on her knees very properly like a
traditional Japanese girl. 
</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
got up and moved to the maid's side. "So, your name is Hanami?"
she asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Yes."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
a nice name."</p><p class="standard">	"Thank
you."</p><p class="standard">	"Were
your parents Japanese?"</p><p class="standard">	"No."</p><p class="standard">	She
volunteered no other information. Yuji hoped Mariko would take this
as a signal not to go any further, and she did.</p><p class="standard">	"Bet
it's nice to get out of the hotel," she commented.</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't mind," the maid replied.</p><p class="standard">	"It
doesn't get stuffy in there?"</p><p class="standard">	"There
is sufficient air circulation."</p><p class="standard">	"You
never feel like stretching your legs?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
do not."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
subsided for a moment, sipping her tea and having another cake. "How
long have you worked there?" she asked. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
have worked in Victoria Hotel for ten years."</p><p class="standard">	"You
don't look much older than me."</p><p class="standard">	"I
am fifteen years old."</p><p class="standard">	"So
you're actually younger than me," said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
was watching them, marveling at the maid's capacity for giving
equivocal responses. This was a tactic he needed to master for the
next time somebody asked for his help with something. He felt Sishica
tap on his shoulder.</p><p class="standard">	"Er,
Mr. Watanabe? Pyliria says that at first, the elves believed our
offer to entertain the children was a trick," said Sishica. "She
says that in the past, humans have stolen elven children and killed
them in order to make charms and medicines from their remains."</p><p class="standard">	"Hm,"
said Yuji. It sounded like bullcrap to him.</p><p class="standard">	"The
village has lost a few children of late. Many of the villagers
believe that some human poacher is hiding in the area and has been
kidnapping them. Pyliria wishes to know if we might help them by
finding the culprits."</p><p class="standard">	"Sorry,
but I'm not here to play cops and robbers," said Yuji. "After
today, I'm going home. You and your mother can help them if you
want."</p><p class="standard">	"C'mon,
Yuji!" said Mariko, coming around to stand behind him and then
punching him in the arm. "Where's your sense of chivalry?"</p><p class="standard">	"Chivalry?
You're barking up the wrong tree. Act like a professional, Mariko."</p><p class="standard">	"A
professional what?"</p><p class="standard">	"Anything,
as long as it's a profession that doesn't go into third-world
countries and start chasing around murderers."</p><p class="standard">	"Leave
him alone, Sishica," said Rekka. "The human is a coward.
Nyvamna or not, he's too afraid to help these people."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
right," said Yuji. "My mommy isn't the great and powerful
Arishil, Princess of Fung. If I die, she can't just brush it off as
'You win some, you lose some.' She might even be sad."</p><p class="standard">	Rekka's
answer was cut off when they heard someone yelling from beyond the
house. Yuji recognized the voice almost immediately: it was Akari,
yelling "Mr. Watanabe, Mr. Watanabe!" in her best manic
genki girl voice. She appeared a moment later around the side of the
house, followed by Ai, the prince, and the prince's journalist and
bodyguard.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
stood up and watched them approach, Akari running ahead of the pack,
Ai following with the prince on her like mold on bread, and his two
flunkies some distance behind.</p><p class="standard">	"Mr.
Watanabe!" Akari exclaimed between huffs and puffs. "I ran
all the way over when I found out! I knew you'd want to help with it!
The elves―"</p><p class="standard">	"Wait,
don't tell me. Someone's been killing their children, and for some
reason I can't fathom, you think I want to help track down the
killer," said Yuji. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
how'd you guess?" Akari beamed. "Let's get started, then!"</p><p class="standard">	"I
was just telling this to Mariko, but I'm not going to get involved in
tracking down murders, and neither are you. We're going to go home
and live happily ever after."</p><p class="standard">	"C'mon,
we've already helped these people a little, what makes this any
different?" said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"It's
different because it's not handing out T-shirts and sacks of flour!
This is about tracking down someone extremely dangerous―implied
by his willingness to kill for money―and hoping we can fight
him by ourselves, and yes, Mariko, you're a nyvamna, but that really
won't do you much good if he's got a machine gun, now will it? As for
you, Akari, I don't know what makes you think you'd be coming along
even if we were going to do it, because you have no way to defend
yourself."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
a nyvamna," Akari answered.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
stared at her, then glanced at Ai, who gave a small nod. He noticed
the prince looking angry, but he had no time to worry about it.
"Fine, you're a nyvamna." Ai had identified him and Mariko,
so he had no reason to doubt her.</p><p class="standard">"So
pretend I'm a murderer. What do you do? Use your nyvamna powers."</p><p class="standard">	"First,
I analyze you and find out whether you're a nyvamna," said
Akari. "If you are, and your powers depend on an Enochian Field,
I break it. Then my niisama, Mr. Watanabe, and my neechan Mariko,
come in and beat you up!"</p><p class="standard">	"Sounds
good to me," said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shook his head. "Why are you always like this, Mariko?"</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
grinned and shrugged. "<i>Le
coeur a raison―</i>"</p><p class="standard">	"Stop.
I don't need to hear it again."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">

	</p><p class="standard">	Here
he was again.</p><p class="standard">	Standing
in the center of his room at three in the morning, the entire hotel
dark as the depths of the earth, his body copious with febrile heat.
Here he was leaving the room again, his terminus unclear, struggling
towards something with a heart full of desperation.</p><p class="standard">	Here
were the halls, the thick carpet soft between his toes, as he walked
in a blur along moonlight corridors. This time he passed Mariko's
room. He got in the elevator and rode up to the sixth floor.</p><p class="standard">	The
door to Ai's room opened without trouble. He hadn't expected any from
her; she was a docile sort, the sort who would marry a prince she'd
known for all of a week if he pressured her enough. 
</p><p class="standard">	There
she was, a lump of flesh wrapped in blankets, pink and succulent like
a piece of fish wrapped in butcher paper. Yuji lifted the knife and
began to carve her into bite-sized chunks.</p><p class="standard">	He
stumbled out of the room, his head spinning. He tumbled along past a
few doors, trying to reach the elevator, before tripping on his own
feet and falling on his face. His joints throbbed in rhythm; now the
surface of his knee added its own discordant note to the progression.

</p><p class="standard">	He
rolled over onto his back and noticed a light under the door to his
left. He rose to his knees and moved closer, drawn by the soft orange
glow. The keyhole was large enough; Yuji set his eye to it like the
lens of a telescope and peered through.</p><p class="standard">	Two
people were making love on the bed, bathed in the glow of a fire. The
woman was on top, her red-golden hair and her small, shapely breasts
shaking with each thrust. The man was making ridiculous noises like a
faucet makes when air bubbles are in the pipes, and attempting to
declaim poetry. Yuji recognized them both immediately. That hair
color made Ai difficult to misidentify. He began to admire the sight
of her bare shoulders, the skin so smooth and white, and the curve of
her back as it curled inward and then outward, sketching the shape of
her butt. He watched her bounce on the prince's erection, her breasts
shaking, heard her give a small moan with each bounce. Up and down
she sprung in an inexorable rhythm that soon matched itself to the
throbbing of Yuji's joints and Yuji's own erection. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji?"</p><p class="standard">	The
whispered sound of his own name broke his trance and he looked up and
saw Ai standing next to him, fully-clothed in her usual jumper and
Mary Janes with high socks. He opened his mouth to speak, but she
held her finger to her lips to silence him.</p><p class="standard">	"Someone
came into my room," she whispered. "At first, I thought it
was the prince, but they ran when I woke up. I think it was one of
the poachers that have been attacking the elf village."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
nodded.</p><p class="standard">	"I
think he's still in the hotel, but he won't be for long. Can you help
me track him?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
nodded again.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
smiled at him. He hadn't seen her smile in weeks. He felt a lump in
his throat. "I'm glad you're here," she whispered.  "Okay,
I'll go down to the main entrance. Can you take the back door in the
kitchen?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
nodded a third time.</p><p class="standard">	"Thank
you." She silently slipped past him and headed for the
stairwell. He followed a moment later.</p><p class="standard">	As
he rounded landing after landing he heard Ai's footsteps ahead of
him, the soles of her shoes clacking on the metal stairs. He wondered
how she expected to ambush a murderer when he could hear her from a
mile away. His own bare feet hardly made a sound.</p><p class="standard">	He
reached the ground floor and almost tripped over Ai, who was sidled
up next to the door, peeking out through a tiny crack into the
darkened lobby. 
</p><p class="standard">	"He's
still here," she whispered. "I can feel him." She
slipped through the door. Yuji followed her.</p><p class="standard">	He
felt the cold tile of the lobby's floor on his bare feet. The
moonlight had filled the room, streaming through the skylights on the
roof high above and creating shafts of silver light, dancing with
dust particles. He could feel adrenaline pulsing through him,
heightening all his senses; he seemed to hear everything twice as
loud as it was, including the sound of Ai's shoes and the various
creaks and groans that the floor gave. 
</p><p class="standard">	He
heard a shuffling noise and froze. Ai froze too. "Do you see
him?" she breathed. "He's headed for the kitchen."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
squinted and almost jumped; he could see a dark shape creeping along
the far end of the lobby towards the corridor that led into the
kitchens. 
</p><p class="standard">	Ai
held him back until the shape had disappeared into the corridor, and
then began to move towards it herself, shuffling rather than stepping
to avoid making a sound with her shoes. Yuji followed her, wondering
at the back of his mind why he was letting the crawling, cow'ring,
tim'rous beasty take the lead, even if she was an esper. He did
nothing to change it, however, and kept to her side.</p><p class="standard">	When
they reached the corridor, with its carpet that padded the sound of
Mary Janes hitting the floor, Ai began to run as fast as she could
without making any shoe noises, and Yuji mimicked her, keeping to her
speed. They came to the rubber swinging doors of the kitchen and
pushed through to find the back door open, moonlight and cool air
pushing through.</p><p class="standard">	"Damn,"
Ai swore. "We've got to be quick. Come on!" She set off,
pushing through the door into the back alley with Yuji following as
quickly as he could, though when he hit concrete his feet were
pierced by hundreds of tiny rocks. He tried to keep up, but she was
running full-tilt, and even as short as she was, she was faster in
shoes than he was barefoot. Soon she had disappeared around the
corner of a building.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
stopped to catch his breath, hoping the murderer would lose her and
they could all go safely home. He stumbled, the sharp pains in his
feet making him forget the throbbing in his joints. He held onto a
trashcan so he could lift his foot and pick the stones out of it.
Then he caught sight of a glowing figure from the corner of his eye
and stopped.</p><p class="standard">	At
the end of the alley stood the blonde, shining figure of Arishil. She
beckoned Yuji with a graceful movement, and he moved toward her,
shielding his eyes from the light. Her white gown fell around her,
shimmering and flowing.</p><p class="standard">	"Die,
<i>cabr</i>!"
a voice yelled, and in an instant Arishil had disappeared and a dark
shape was falling towards him from the roof. He felt himself pulled
out of the way by strong arms and heard a clash of metal on metal. He
fell to the ground and tumbled over, trying to escape danger.</p><p class="standard">	An
instant, and it was over. Yuji stood up and faced his savior. It was
Hanami, the maid who had guided them to the elf village earlier. She
was still wearing her maid uniform, but her long blonde hair, gold
mixed with silver moonlight, had been tied back into a ponytail. Yuji
wondered if he'd mistaken her for Arishil; the maid was rather short
and slight, unlike the tall Arishil, but the hair was very similar. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Are
you injured?" she asked, her voice monotone as before. Yuji
shook his head. "Follow me. He is running to his comrades. Once
he reaches them, he won't run any further."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
was about to say he didn't think he could keep up with her, since he
was barefoot and in his pajamas and had been unable to keep up with
Ai, who was much shorter than him, but the maid had run off before he
had a chance to say any of this, and he found himself following her.
Once he'd reached her side, Hanami matched her pace to his, allowing
him to keep up despite his bare feet.</p><p class="standard">	"He
won't run," said Hanami. "They want to fight us. We don't
need to hurry."</p><p class="standard">	It
was very creepy walking through the dark cobblestone streets at a
slow stroll, but it seemed the maid was right; every minute or so
Yuji heard a noise from the darkness, the moving of shadows keeping
track of their movements. The dark shape was moving around them,
watching them.</p><p class="standard">	A
few blocks down the alley emptied into a large, open plaza. At the
center, bathed in silver light, was a white marble fountain, adorned
with a statue of a nude young woman with her arms raised above the
masses, each of her fingers running a stream of water into the pool
below. Dark shapes, clustered around the far side of the fountain,
seemed to notice their approach and come around to greet them.</p><p class="standard">	As
the figures came into the moonlight, Yuji couldn't believe what he
saw. The first figure was a tall Indian teenage boy, bearded and
wearing a Sikh head wrap and a jeweled dagger at his waist, but also
jean shorts and a black skateboarding T-shirt. The next Yuji saw was
a black teenage girl with her hair in cornrows, also very tall. The
third was an Asian boy in a wheelchair, the moonlight glinting on his
glasses and his black hair. The fourth was a Hispanic boy, shorter
than the black girl and the Indian boy, with a hard look in his eyes.
The last two were both Anglo-American, one a blond boy and one a girl
with light-brown hair. All of them except the Indian boy wore big,
loose jeans and a T-shirt, though everyone's T-shirt was a different
color: pink for the black girl, navy blue for the Asian boy, grey for
the Hispanic boy, yellow for the white girl, and red for the white
boy. Yuji was reminded of the multiracial, multicultural,
multicolored Power Rangers, or possibly the Planeteers whose powers
combined to summon Captain Planet.</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't know who you are," said the white boy, who seemed to be
the leader, "but we <i>own
</i>the
charity racket in this town. 
</p><p class="standard">	Hanami
didn't speak, and Yuji had no idea what to say. The white boy seemed
amused by this; he sneered and jerked his head. This was apparently a
signal to his companions; they spread out, not enough to surround
Yuji and Hanami, but enough to make a charge without getting in each
others' ways. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Who
are you?" said Hanami.</p><p class="standard">	"We
are Glenco. Named for the power that watches over this world, our
group is dedicated to improving the lives of teenagers the world
over!" said the white guy. "My name is Michael Kennedy.
These are my companions: Gurpreet Singh, Morqueeshah Stiles, Thuan
Nguyen, Antonio Enr厲uez-Ibarra,
and Jessica Thompson. We will destroy you!"</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah!"
added Thuan Ngyuen, the boy in the wheelchair. "We have been
observing you, Yuji Watanabe. We know that you are not the sort of
person who stands in a multicultural group and laughs. This is
clearly unhealthy for a young man. Perhaps if you were to follow the
Five Steps to a Healthy, Humorous, Multicultural Life, chronicled in
the Book of Glenco, you would be a more healthy person. However, as
you do not, you cannot be considered healthy."</p><p class="standard">	"And
you be even less healthy when I'm through wi' you!" added
Antonio Enr厲uez-Ibarra,
pounding his palms against his chest.</p><p class="standard">	"We
own the charity racket in this town," said Gurpreet Singh. "Get
out of town before you can't."</p><p class="standard">	"Do
you wish to fight?" Hanami asked in her same monotone. Yuji
wondered how she could stay so calm. This group didn't seem like much
of a threat, but there were six of them against just two, and at
least one of them seemed to have some fighting ability, since he'd
tried to jump off a roof and attack Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah
we wan' to fight!" said Antonio Enr厲uez-Ibarra,
pounding his chest again. "We wan' to do more than that! We wan'
to <i>keel
</i>you!"</p><p class="standard">	"Then
I must indulge you," said Hanami. She had widened her stance and
bent her knees, readying to make an attack. The Hispanic boy left the
lineup, coming forward.</p><p class="standard">	"Please
stop." Yuji spun around and saw Ai coming out of the alley
behind them. Though she walked out confidently enough, Yuji figured
she'd gotten lost in the alleys and had just managed to take up the
path again and find her way to the plaza. It was a very Ai-like thing
to do.</p><p class="standard">	"Please
stop," she said again. "This isn't the right time or place
for you to fight."</p><p class="standard">	"They
wish to fight," said Hanami. "Who am I to refuse?" 
</p><p class="standard">	"Innocent
people may be hurt," said Ai. "Yuji and I may be hurt. So
I'm afraid I have to insist." She walked past Yuji, coming up
behind Hanami, and spoke words in another language, not any that Yuji
recognized: <i>"L</i><i>仼</i><i>acir
ea mir</i><i>疣</i><i>ola,
orjucir a tisucir a cindracir a tisurungacir mapengacir su uqu</i><i>侒</i><i>n,
njaberype fudjinca-�a!"</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>Hanami
immediately straightened up, no longer in a fighting position, her
ankles together and her hands glued to her thighs. <i>"Njaberypeme,"
</i>she
said.</p><p class="standard">	"Ha,
look at that!" laughed Jessica Thompson. "This maid is
still based on the CX-series brain."</p><p class="standard">	"A
design flaw that has since been corrected!" said Michael
Kennedy. "You'll get no such reaction from us!"</p><p class="standard">	"Then
you're like her?" said Ai. "Artificial?"</p><p class="standard">	"We
have none of the failings of flesh," said Michael Kennedy.</p><p class="standard">	"And
you're the ones who've been attacking the elf village?"</p><p class="standard">	"Even
we require some funding," said Michael Kennedy.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
sighed. "If only I'd known that sooner...I could've let her do
it. I guess I'll have to take care of you now."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
stepped forward with a mind to help her, but a stabbing pain shot
through his head. He grasped his forehead with both hands, trying to
massage it away, but another burst ravaged his skull, and he fell to
his knees. He heard Ai saying his name and vaguely felt her hands on
him, but he had no idea what else was going on as he crumpled to the
cobblestones.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	Small
hands were shaking him. So many of his dreams began that way. Which
dream was it this time? Was it the one where he had an oniichanko for
a sister instead of a selfish, cancer-ridden whore? The one where he
had a cute young maid, and didn't have to feel guilty that he was
leaving the housework undone during this week away from home? Or the
one where his childhood friend who secretly loved him came every day
to wake him up for school?</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
realized that the small hands were real. He lifted his head an inch
or so from the pillow, felt pain cross his neck, and let it fall back
down. "I'm awake, Ai!" he mumbled. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Mr.
Watanabe?" asked a male voice. Yuji shot up and saw that it
wasn't Ai, or even Akari; it was Sishica, Arishil's red-haired child,
dressed in jeans and a T-shirt like a normal nine-year-old.</p><p class="standard">	"Why
are you here?" Yuji asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Um...I
came to wake you," Sishica said. "Miss Mariko said you were
still asleep, and I wanted to have tea with you, so I c-came to..."</p><p class="standard">	"Why
do you want to have tea with me?" Yuji asked. It was the only
question that occurred to him.</p><p class="standard">	Sishica
blushed and looked away, more than ever like a male version of Ai.
"I-I just wanted to talk to you a little...If that's okay..."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
threw off the covers. "I guess so, but at least let me get
dressed first. Wait here." He hadn't bothered to put any of his
clothes in the closet except the rented tuxedo, which needed to be
returned to the tailor's shop; the rest were sitting in a pile on top
of his duffle bag. He grabbed a shirt and a pair of pants and went
into the bathroom to change.</p><p class="standard">	When
he came out, Sishica was already sitting at the small table. "I-I
ordered room service. I hope I haven't done anything wrong."</p><p class="standard">	"No,
nothing." Yuji sat down across from him and stared at him. After
yesterday, this kid seemed to have taken a liking to him. He didn't
think he liked kids, this kid, or any kid of Arishil, but it seemed
rude to kick him out.</p><p class="standard">	<i>God,
he tricked me, just like Akari.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>After
a few seconds of staring, the kid blushed and looked away again. "Why
are you looking at me like that, Mr. Watanabe?"</p><p class="standard">	"Just
wondering," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Wondering
what?"</p><p class="standard">	"If
you're really that big a pansy, or if it's an act. I think it's real;
if it was an act, your sister would be in on it too."</p><p class="standard">	"I-I
can assure you that this is not an act," said Sishica, his eyes
darting every which way but towards Yuji. "I'm just...very
nervous. Oh, gosh..."</p><p class="standard">	"What
are you nervous about, and if being here makes you that nervous, why
did you come?"</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
nervous because I don't want to make a mistake. I...Mr. Watanabe, how
is your relationship with your father?"</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?"
The doorbell rang, and Yuji got up to answer it. It was the room
service cart, carrying a tray of tea, muffins, and sandwiches. Yuji
carried it inside, starting to feel hungry, and set it on the table.
He and Sishica poured themselves tea, and Yuji had finished two
sandwiches before he returned to Sishica's question.</p><p class="standard">	"What
does my relationship with my father have to do with anything?"
he asked.</p><p class="standard">	"You
see, my people are eusocial. Our queen and princesses are the only
females capable of having children. We are also able to alter our
biological structure and internal chemistry through our own will, so
we are not limited to mating with our own species; my mother can
store the gametes of almost any species within her body, and use them
at any time to make herself with child."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
found that rather disgusting, but he filled his mouth with tea to
resist the urge to say something to that effect. He nodded so that
Sishica would go on.</p><p class="standard">	Sishica
jumped and blushed. "I mean...that's how it used to be. My
grandmother and most of my aunts were killed in the flight from Fung,
leaving my mother the only princess of our people. Luckily, some of
the males escaped as well, so she was able to have children to
replenish our species. Um, the point is that I never knew my father.
Of course I can narrow him down to one of the men of the Sixteen, but
even if I could determine which of them it is, he would never
acknowledge me. My mother made this rule so that jealousy and
nepotism would not destroy the last remnant of our race."</p><p class="standard">	"So
you're wondering what it's like to have a father," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Yes.
Um, what sort of man is your father?"</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
I guess he's okay. He was at work a lot when I was a kid. He still
is, actually," said Yuji. "But whenever he had time, he'd
spend it with me. He signed me up for martial arts when I wanted it.
And he got me a job drawing for a game company." Clearly, Faerie
children were more advanced at this age than human children, but Yuji
still didn't think he needed to reveal what kind of games his
employer made.</p><p class="standard">	"And
if you were ever in danger, did he protect you?"<br />	"Too
many times to count. I got in so many fights with other kids who were
trying to bully me, or bully my friends, and my dad always had to
come down and talk to the principal about it. But he always believed
me when I said I didn't start it, and he never said he regretted
letting me take martial arts, even though my mom was always saying
that."</p><p class="standard">	"It
sounds as though he was a good father," said Sishica.</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,"
Yuji agreed. He thought of Yumiko and Akari's father, who had taken
the infant Akari, dropped her with his own father, and run off
somewhere, leaving Yumiko to become a psychotic whore. Their mother
took the prize for worst parent, but he wasn't too impressed with
their father either.</p><p class="standard">	"It
sounds nice to have a father," said Sishica. "Of course, my
mother is always very kind. Some of the others, such as Rebecca and
Rycg, laugh at me for being as I am, but my mother always defends
me."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
tried to imagine their supernatural sibling squabbles, all inside a
giant tree, and nearly laughed. It was like something straight from
the pages of Marvel Comics.</p><p class="standard">	"Of
course, if you were to come live with us, as Irlumarmitpa, you would
be something like a father to all of us," said Sishica. He
blushed and looked down at his cup of tea.</p><p class="standard">	"What
is the Irlumarmitpa supposed to be?" Yuji asked. "Why is
your mother so keen to find him?"</p><p class="standard">	"The
prophecy says that if the leader of our people bears a child of the
Irlumarmitpa, that child will begin the next stage of our species'
evolution," said Sishica. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Why
would that be so important?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't know. Some of the others, such as The Shattered and The Driven,
believe that we should not want it. They interpret the prophecy as
saying that the Irlumarmitpa's power shall be to bring our people
closer to his own, in effect continuing our species by destroying it.
Others, such as The Chanced and The Lied, believe the Irlumarmitpa
has the power to allow my mother to ascend at last from princess to
queen, and so make her able to impart the status of princess to her
own children. That would allow us to seed more clans, as we had in
the old days."</p><p class="standard">	"What
do you think?" Yuji asked.</p><p class="standard">	Sishica
shook his head. "I don't know what to believe. But if we were to
be absorbed into the human population, I don't think it would be such
a bad thing. Our species is dying. Better that some part of us
survives than that every trace of us goes out of the world. So I-I
think that...no matter what comes of it, that you should come live
with us." He said the last part very quickly, as if wanting to
get it out before Yuji could speak, and then stared at his tea and
half-eaten sandwich. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
took another sandwich, took one bite, and decided he wasn't hungry
anymore. He put it down on his plate. "Look, I'm sure your
mother is real nice, and you seem real nice and all, but I don't want
to become a pet or a toy. I have other things I'd rather be doing."</p><p class="standard">	"Y-you
wouldn't!" Sishica assured him. "I mean, if you didn't want
to, that is, you know, you would allowed to do as you pleased, and so
if you wished for anything that we could not provide, you would be
allowed to seek for it."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shook his head. "Sorry. It's just not going to happen."</p><p class="standard">	Sishica
looked downcast. Yuji didn't think he could take it if the little
brat started crying; he'd start yelling and kick the manipulative
nymphet out of the room.</p><p class="standard">	"May
I make a request?" Sishica said.</p><p class="standard">	"Depends
on what it is."</p><p class="standard">	"Would
you come with me somewhere?"</p><p class="standard">	"Where?"
Yuji asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Only
to the basement. I, I want to show you something."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
frowned. "Even if you have Akari tied up down there, I'm still
not going with you."</p><p class="standard">	Sishica
shook his head. "No, no! Nothing like that."</p><p class="standard">	"What
is it, then?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
can't tell you. But I think it's something you'll want to see."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
stood up, found his shoes, and put them on. "All right, lead the
way."</p><p class="standard">	Grinning,
Sishica preceded him out of the room and led him towards the
elevator. Once inside, he hit the button for B1 level. Yuji had no
idea what he wanted him to see; as far as he knew, B1 level had
nothing but laundry on it. He didn't like that grin, though. He
didn't want to see any of Arishil's henchmen grinning that much. 
</p><p class="standard">	"How
do I know you're not just getting me to go into the basement so your
buddies can tie me up and drive me off?" he asked.</p><p class="standard">	Sishica
looked horrified. "No! I would never, never do such a
thing...never...I mean, just...the very notion..."</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't know that I can trust you," said Yuji. "Your mother's
friends tried to take me by force."</p><p class="standard">	"They
weren't supposed to," said Sishica. "They were assigned to
bring you in any way they could, but they were forbidden to use
force."</p><p class="standard">	"So
it was fine when Rebecca hijacked Ai's powers, tricked me, screwed
with my head, and jerked me around, but when Jinjo tried to punch me,
<i>that
</i>was
going too far."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh
no...I'm making a mess of everything...No, Mr. Watanabe, my mother
hoped that The Harmony might persuade you openly to come to us. After
what happened before, she has ordered all of us to attempt to our
utmost to gain your willing cooperation," said Sishica. 
</p><p class="standard">	He
seemed sincere. Yuji didn't want to believe that Sishica was a liar,
but more so, he didn't want to believe that he was bad enough at
spotting liars to be fooled by Sishica. 
</p><p class="standard">	The
elevator reached the basement level. Sishica led the way into a dim,
carpeted hallway lined with doors labeled "Clean Closet" in
English. Bad English, but still English. Yuji hadn't seen any signs
posted in the native language the entire time they'd been on
Clarissia. 
</p><p class="standard">	"This
way please, Mr. Watanabe," said Sishica, leading him down a
staircase into a storage room, the walls lined with racks and racks
of folded sheets and towels. Several large carts, also stacked with
sheets and towels, had been parked at the far corner of the room next
to a service elevator. 
</p><p class="standard">	"What
are we doing here?" Yuji asked, but before he'd finished,
Sishica had darted off towards the service elevator and disappeared.
The doors opened, then closed again, and the elevator began to rise
towards the laundry room.</p><p class="standard">	"Thank
you for tea, Mr. Watanabe. Please consider coming to live with us,"
said Sishica's voice, but he was nowhere to be seen; the room and
elevator were both empty.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
didn't have the slightest idea what that little bastard was up to,
leading him down here and running off, but he didn't plan to stick
around for hide-and-go-seek. He turned around and had his foot on the
lowest step when he heard a familiar voice. He couldn't quite make
out what it was saying, but it was definitely the prince's voice. Not
wanting to run into the prince, he slipped away from the steps,
lifted himself into a cart of dirty laundry, and buried himself in
sweaty-smelling white cotton sheets. 
</p><p class="standard">	Now
that it was done, Yuji felt stupid for hiding like a child to avoid
seeing the prince, but it was too late now; he could hear footsteps
on the stairs, and if he got out now, he'd have to explain why he was
in a laundry cart. Instead he lifted the sheet from over his head
just enough to let him see and watched the prince come into the
storage room, accompanied by Ai. She had her hair up in a simple
ponytail today, but she was wearing the same clothes she'd had on
last night in his dream, when she'd gone running into the streets.
Yuji wondered if she'd ever worn them before this, when they would've
stuck in his mind to reappear in the dream.</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
what did you want to talk to me about in such a secluded place?"
Ai asked. "Um, this place is a little dark, isn't it? There's a
nice, sunny terrace outside where we could have talked, it would've
been a little more―"</p><p class="standard">	"Quiet,"
the prince commanded, and Ai fell silent. For some reason, this
annoyed Yuji. <i>No
one gets to order her around like a dog but me, </i>he
thought.</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
sorry, I was rambling," she apologized. "But may we get to
business? I have packing and things to do―"</p><p class="standard">	"It
doth amaze," the prince exclaimed, "how after a night such
as that past, thou may speak so lightly of fripperies! Hast thou no
shame, coquette? Has a whore such as thee no ken of what thou hast
committed?"</p><p class="standard">	Ai's
nervous smile disappeared. "What are you talking about?"
she asked, frowning.</p><p class="standard">	"Simply
amazing! I speak of the night prior, and of the acts we have
committed, thou and I! I speak of thee, who tiptoed into my chamber
and, in hot blood, gave thy love's blood to me! Returneth now thy
memory?"</p><p class="standard">	Ai
blushed. "I'm sorry, if you mean what I think you do..."</p><p class="standard">	"My
meaning, woman, is not easy to mistake!" Van stamped his foot
and rose up, and Ai shrank back in response. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
sorry, but you must have remembered wrong," she said in a
near-whisper. "I didn't do anything like that last night. I did
get up, sometime around two. Someone was in my room―"</p><p class="standard">	"Another
of your paramours, no doubt!" the prince said.</p><p class="standard">	"He
tried to attack me. I woke up and screamed, and he ran away. I
followed him into the street, but I lost him," Ai finished. "I
was definitely not in your room."</p><p class="standard">	"I
believe the evidence of mine own eyes over thy lies, witch!"
said the prince. "Perhaps thou knowest not of what thou hast.
The love's blood is given cheaply in thy land. But in my land, a
woman without her love's blood must betroth herself with the man to
whom it was given, else suffer the wrath of the gods. And the man who
has taken it must in equal measure fear the wrath of Kisnos, who
guards all maidens. Therefore, on this day, by the laws of Montagria
and of Clarissia, we must betroth ourselves."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
sorry...I really don't know what's going on, but I'm absolutely sure
that I wasn't in your room yesterday, and I think I should be going
now," said Ai. She turned to leave. 
</p><p class="standard">	Prince
Van seized her arm and yanked her back. Yuji saw his fingers sink
deep into her flesh, like the claws of some large cat into its prey. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Your
lies shall unmask themselves when all can see that you are with
child!" the prince snarled.</p><p class="standard">	"Please
let go of me," said Ai quietly. 
</p><p class="standard">	The
prince shoved her away and raised his arm as if he were going to hit
her. She clenched her eyes shut, and Yuji was about to jump out of
the laundry cart and tear the prince's hand off, but he lowered his
arm and stormed out of the room without striking her.</p><p class="standard">	Once
he had gone, Ai opened her eyes and exhaled loudly. Yuji watched her
pace back and forth for a moment, probably waiting for the prince to
be well away, before she too left the room. <strike>"You
can come out of the laundry basket now," she said. "Is it
you, Yuji?"</strike></p><p class="standard"><strike>	Yuji
cringed, embarrassed to be discovered hiding in a basket. He threw
the blanket off his head and stood up. "Yeah, it's me."</strike></p><p class="standard"><strike>	"I
thought so. There's a particular feeling that I have only when you're
around," said Ai with a smile. "I felt like there was no
way I could be hurt."</strike></p><p class="standard"><strike>	"There
is no way you could be hurt. You're an esper," Yuji pointed out.</strike></p><p class="standard"><strike>	Ai
shook her head. "No...I can be hurt much more easily than you
think."</strike></p><p class="standard">	Yuji
waited another minute for Ai to be well gone before he threw the
sheet off his head and climbed out of the laundry basket. His head
was spinning; if last night hadn't been a dream, what the hell had it
been? How could he have killed Ai, then seen her with the prince,
then chased robots with her?</p><p class="standard">	<i>Robots.
</i>That
maid, Hanami, had been there. She could corroborate Ai's story even
if Yuji couldn't. Yuji would go the prince's room, tell him about
last night, and invite him to speak with Hanami if he didn't believe
it. He didn't believe for a minute that Ai had actually been in the
prince's room; even though the hair color had been the same, he still
thought it more likely he'd make a mistake about the identity of a
person seen through a keyhole by firelight from behind than about
that of someone standing right in front of him and speaking to him.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
followed Sishica's example and took the service elevator back up to
the sixth floor. The prince's room was a few doors down from the
elevator. He probably could have had some sort of royal suite with a
huge hot tub and a view of the city, instead of being in a normal
room with no windows, but he'd probably requested the nearest room to
Ai he could get.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
was about to knock on the door when he heard a voice through the
keyhole. "If Glenco is hiding out in the elf village―"</p><p class="standard">	"Allow
me to save you the pain of thought," said the prince. "Glenco
<i>is
</i>hiding
in the village. I have arranged it thus. I had sent a servant to pose
as a dealer in balms and salves of elf humor. He told them of the
capital that may be gained of such freight."</p><p class="standard">	"Then
why have they attacked these children here, and this Nembris that you
are so determined to possess?" the first voice asked. Yuji knelt
and peered through the keyhole and saw that this voice belonged to
the bodyguard. The propagandist was also there, sitting on a chair in
the corner with his legs crossed and watching the other two.</p><p class="standard">	"They
must have received word that some of these fools had schemed to hunt
them down," said Prince Van. "They know nothing of my part
in bringing them here."</p><p class="standard">	"And
what motive, may I ask, underlied that act? Some stratagem to win the
woman's hand?"</p><p class="standard">	"Of
course," said the prince. "I believed that she would not
resist if I were to feign that trouble would ensue for me after what
passed last night if I did not marry her, but she continues.
Therefore I shall carry out my original plan. We must by some art
entrap one of these fools and give them for a ransom to Glenco. Then
I shall agree to defeat Glenco in exchange for the hand of Nembris in
marriage."</p><p class="standard">	"But
has not Woraco yet to decide whether you are even to have her?"
the bodyguard asked.</p><p class="standard">	"I
care not for Woraco and his scheming," said the prince. "I
shall have her whether he say yea or nay." He turned to the
propagandist. "Now, which of them shall we give to Glenco?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
believe the youngest girl to be a fine choice," said the
propagandist. "And perhaps we may also have the chance to
acquire a store of elf weapons. Princess Terra does so hoard them,
doesn't she?"<br />	"An excellent plan," said Van.
"Perhaps you'd like to find her?"</p><p class="standard">	"Indeed,"
the propagandist agreed. "I shall invite her to a private visit
to the palace. Then, as we sip mugs of beer in the tavern, ruffians
shall slip something into our drinks and she shall awake in the hands
of Glenco."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
couldn't wait for the three of them to start with the evil
"Mwahahah!" laugh; he slipped away to Akari's room, towards
the back of the sixth floor, hoping she was there so he could warn
her. There was a chance "the youngest girl" meant Rekka,
but if so, her mother would have to look out for her. Yuji was only
concerned if it meant Akari, as he suspected.</p><p class="standard">	He
knocked on the door to Akari's room and got no answer. "Akari!"
he called. Still no answer. It was late afternoon, so she was
probably off playing somewhere. If she was with Mariko, she might be
safe, but Mariko had no reason to suspect Van's reporter of anything,
so it might just end with both of them tied up. He had to find her,
even if she was in town. Someone must have seen her around.</p><p class="standard">	He
circled back around towards the elevator. It was just going down when
he turned the corner. That was probably the prince's henchman. Yuji
waited a minute to make sure the prince himself wasn't going to come
out of the room and then he went over and summoned the elevator
again. 
</p><p class="standard">	"You
need help?" asked the receptionist, a perky dark-haired girl,
when Yuji went up to the front desk.</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
I need to know if a girl passed by here. She's about fourteen, around
five feet tall, with chestnut-brown hair."</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
such a person did pass by," said the receptionist. "A boy
with red hair was with her. They went into town."</p><p class="standard">	"Do
you know where they went?" Yuji asked.</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
sorry, I don't."</p><p class="standard">	"Okay,
thank you."</p><p class="standard">	He
went out onto the front steps, past two marble statues of people he
assumed were ancestors of Princess Terra and Prince Van, and down
into the front walk. A grass-lined path snaked its way towards the
main parking lot, where a guardhouse barred entry by the uninvited.
He was walking past a line of Bentleys and Aston-Martins on his right
and a stand of menthol-smelling eucalyptus trees on his left when he
heard a voice address him.</p><p class="standard">	"Master
Yuji. Where are you going?" It was the blonde-haired maid,
Hanami, half-hidden amongst the trees. Today she had on short sleeves
and tennis shoes, and wore no tights under her skirt and white apron.

</p><p class="standard">	"I
need to find Akari," said Yuji. "She's from our group, the
youngest one, and I think she's in danger."</p><p class="standard">	"What
danger?" Hanami asked. She came toward him, out of the trees,
the grace of her movements seeming eerie now that Yuji knew she
wasn't quite normal.</p><p class="standard">	"I
heard the prince and his men talking. They plan to kidnap her and
give her to Glenco so they can pretend to rescue her―you know
what, it's a long story, but that's the basic situation. Have you
seen her?"</p><p class="standard">	"She
left one hour ago with Princess Arishil's child," said Hanami.
"They had no fixed destination."</p><p class="standard">	"I
have to find them," said Yuji. "There can't be many places
in this town that would interest her. Where could they have gone?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't know Miss Kanzaki very well. But she might have found the bell
tower interesting," said Hanami. "But Master Yuji, surely
you see the easiest solution to this problem."</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?
No, I must be stupid. Enlighten me."</p><p class="standard">	"Kill
the prince and his men."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
slapped himself on the forehead. "Of course! Kill the leader of
a third-world country! Throwing his country into chaos and getting
his thugs after my ass is the simplest way to solve all this!"</p><p class="standard">	"It
is economical."</p><p class="standard">	"Your
skin and everything look really realistic, but whoever programmed
your head needs to work on it. I'm going to look for them." Yuji
turned to leave, but before he'd gotten one step he felt Hanami's
hand on his shoulder.</p><p class="standard">	"I
obey your command. If you do not wish to follow the simplest course
of action, I will work to simplify the more difficult one. Please
give me an order."</p><p class="standard">	"Huh?
Don't you have work to do in the hotel?" Yuji asked.</p><p class="standard">	"That
does not concern me. They are no longer my masters. You are now my
master."</p><p class="standard">	"When
was this decided?"</p><p class="standard">	"Last
night, when Miss Maeda overrode my directives and reset them."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
sighed. It was just like when Ai had suspected Akari of orchestrating
Yumiko's suicide attempt; she'd dug everything up and then shoved the
decision onto him. "All right. This'll be easier with a car. Can
you get one?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes."</p><p class="standard">	</p><p class="standard">	As
Yuji and Hanami entered the hotel to get keys for a car, the
receptionist looked up and called out to them, holding out an
envelope. "Oh, Mr. Watanabe! There's a message here for you."</p><p class="standard">	"For
me?" Yuji asked, though he had a sinking feeling that he already
knew what it was. He took the envelope and slit it open with his
finger, walked a short distance away from the reception desk, and
withdrew the sheet of paper inside.</p><p class="standard">	The
note was written in exquisite calligraphy. As an artist, Yuji
recognized a good hand with a quill, and whoever had written this was
a master. One of the members of Glenco was probably programmed with
calligraphy subroutines, or something. 
</p><p class="standard">	The
note read: <i>To
Yuji Watanabe. We, of the most holy order of Glenco, devoted as we
are to the ways of health in body, mind, soul, and culture, have
thusly determined to stamp out your unhealthy existence from this
world. To that end, we have, in accordance with the Four Steps to Rid
The World of Unhealthy Existences, expressed by the mnemonic acronym
CALM (Capture their loved ones, A note to make him or her come, Let
him or her think you'll do a fair exchange, Make them both leave this
world), carried out Step 1 by capturing your pedophiliac lover Akari
Kanzaki and your homosexual (not that there's anything wrong with
that; in fact, the absence of a homosexual friend is one sign of your
cultural unhealth) pedophiliac lover Sishica, son of Arishil. </i>
</p><p class="standard"><i>	You
will find us in the central square of the elf village. We wish for
you and the others of your group to present yourselves before us and
throw yourselves upon the mercy of our lord and savior most high, the
Glenco. Sincerely, the earthly representative of his most high and
transcendent majesty the Glenco, Pope of the Church of Glenco, 
Michael Kennedy.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>"This
is insane," said Yuji. He crumpled the note in his hand. "This
isn't happening. This <i>doesn't
</i>happen!"
He felt on the edge of utter panic. He had no idea what to do.</p><p class="standard">	"I
assure you it is most abnormal for me as well," said Hanami.
"But it is occurring. And without the permission of Prince Van
or Princess Terra, we cannot enter the elf village to retrieve them."</p><p class="standard">	"This
is exactly what he wanted," said Yuji. "<i>Exactly
</i>what
he wanted! That bastard wanted Ai to have to ask for his help so he
could hold it over her and get her to accept his marriage proposal."</p><p class="standard">	Hanami
raised an eyebrow. "I do not know anything about that," she
said, "but it seems to me there is a simple solution."</p><p class="standard">	"Which
is?"</p><p class="standard">	"You
yourself must ask for the prince's help, Master Yuji. If it is you
who asks him, he cannot hold the debt against Miss Maeda."</p><p class="standard">	It
seemed so simple when she said it like that. Yuji just stared at her
for a moment, looking into her eyes, dyed with some pigments, the
cold expression in them actually the product of wires and motors
inside her face. Then he turned around and walked straight to the
elevator. Hanami followed him.</p><p class="standard">	When
the doors opened on the sixth floor, Mariko stood on the other side.
"Yuji, what is this about?" she asked, holding up a note.
Yuji took it and saw it was a copy of the one he'd gotten from
Glenco.</p><p class="standard">	"No
time. Is the prince in his room?"</p><p class="standard">	"Ai
went in to talk to him about this—" Mariko began.</p><p class="standard">	"No!"
Yuji hurried to the prince's door and knocked. No answer. He knocked
again, and a third time. "Prince! Your grace! I need to talk to
you!"</p><p class="standard">	The
door swung open. There was the prince, looking unbearably smug in his
Elvis outfit, his thin rapier hung at his side. He arm was around
Ai's shoulders. "Hark, all you of Sakura Memorial, for I shall
give succor! Let us now get us to the village of the elves!"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
crushed Mariko's letter, his fingers sinking so deep into his palm
that his nails scratched holes in the paper. He tried to look Ai in
the eye, but she avoided his gaze, her eyes dancing around to escape
his. He didn't know whether to race right off and fight Glenco or
haul off and punch Van right in the face. He opted for the former.
"Right, let's get going. Hanami, can you get a car?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
Master Yuji," the maid answered.</p><p class="standard">	"Mariko,
are you coming?"</p><p class="standard">	"Coming
to do what?"</p><p class="standard">	"Just
what you've been wanting to do this whole time." Yuji felt his
cheeks pull up into a strained, tooth-baring grin. "We're gonna
save a village, rescue a damsel-in-distress, and kill some bad guys."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	The
prince brought along his henchman and told Ai to await his arrival at
the hotel. Not only did Yuji not appreciate him ordering her around
like she was a maid working at his castle, he also wondered if the
prince had the slightest inkling that she was more powerful than any
of them. 
</p><p class="standard">	He
had sent a messenger to his cousin, Princess Terra, asking for
reinforcements. Yuji was sure when the reinforcements got there, they
would tear the whole village apart looking for weapons and anything
else they wanted, but he didn't like the thought of fighting Glenco
without backup. 
</p><p class="standard">	He
hadn't shut up the whole trip. He'd sat in the van next to Yuji
rambling on and on about the great battle they were about to take
part in, and how even if Yuji died, his memory would live on in the
songs that would be sung of this day. Yuji had asked him if he was a
nyvamna and had gotten an answer that, when you cut out all the
pseudo-Shakespearean jibber-jabber, came down to "No, but I'm
just as powerful as one without even trying."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
glanced at Mariko. She didn't look as gung-ho as he'd thought she
would. "Everything all right?" he asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah.
Just..."</p><p class="standard">	"What?"</p><p class="standard">	"Nothing.
Let's rip these guys apart."</p><p class="standard">	"You're
worried about them being robots, aren't you," said Yuji.
Mariko's slight twitch showed him he was right. "Look, you don't
have to do any fighting. I'm planning to do as little as possible."</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
keep thee from combat, lest thou be injured," the prince
advised. "My man and I shall make quick work of them, without
need of help from a lady."</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't know whether to be flattered he called me a lady or pissed that
he's belittling me," Mariko muttered.</p><p class="standard">	"Pissed,"
Yuji muttered back. "But not that he's belittling you. Just
because he exists."</p><p class="standard">	"I
wonder if he's met Kanako. They could be happy together."</p><p class="standard">	"Enough
talking," said Hanami from the driver's seat. "This is
different from the other day. It isn't a picnic."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
made a rude gesture at Hanami's back but didn't say anything.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
got out of his seat and slipped into the passenger seat next to
Hanami. "Hanami, I want to ask you something."</p><p class="standard">	"I
will answer any question, Master Yuji."</p><p class="standard">	This
seemed like a rather surprising turnaround from her position of a
second ago, but Yuji went ahead. "Glenco is in the elven village
making their kids into hrackin' aphrodisiacs, right? So if the elves
have got all this super technology stashed everywhere, why don't they
just kill Glenco themselves?"</p><p class="standard">	"Thou'rt
unlearned in the ways of the world, sirrah," said the prince.
"The elves are vile creatures. They sell their whelps for a
share of gold."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
glanced at Hanami, annoyed that the prince would even dare to talk
knowing that he himself had invited Glenco to come in the first
place. But Hanami gave a small nod. "Yes. I believe that is so."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
could barely imagine poverty so crushing it drove people into selling
their own children, but he didn't have much time to think about it;
the van began to come to a stop next to the guardhouse.</p><p class="standard">	They
waited for a minute, but the guard didn't come out, so Hanami honked
the horn a few times. Someone came out, carrying a spear, and when he
came up to the window Yuji could see that he was bleary-eyed, and
smelled a wave of alcohol. Probably some horrible fermented grain
drink he kept in a clay bottle under the table.</p><p class="standard">	"What's
goin' on?"</p><p class="standard">	"Fool!"
Van cried. "Criminals hiding in the village have taken captive a
human girl! We aim to save her! If you value your life, send word to
Princess Terra that we require aid!"</p><p class="standard">	"O'
course, sir!" the guard blurted, and turned and ran back to the
guardhouse, where Yuji assumed he had a phone or a telegraph or some
sort of communications device.</p><p class="standard">	Hanami
drove on towards the gates of the elven village. "We require
sound tactics," she said. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Ah,
tactics! A thrust! A parry! A sidestep!" the prince declaimed.</p><p class="standard">	"A
surprise attack," said Hanami.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	They
would have been sunk without her, Yuji reflected, as he faced Glenco
across a mound of garbage. He and Mariko didn't have a clue, and the
prince was worse than useless.</p><p class="standard">	The
strange multicultural band was standing in a knot around Akari and
Sishica, who had been gagged and tied around poles driven into the
ground in front of the mercantile. The elves were all hanging back,
but Yuji could see them in the shacks all around the town square,
their eyes peering between the slats of wood like rats hiding in a
drainpipe. 
</p><p class="standard">	"So,
you have come to surrender yourself to the overpowering might of the
Glenco," said Michael Kennedy.</p><p class="standard">	"That's
right," said Yuji before the prince could start babbling. He
glanced at the prisoners. Sishica looked worried, though not as
afraid as a normal person would be while held hostage by robots;
Akari, Yuji saw with some annoyance, looked utterly blank, as if she
was thinking and feeling exactly nothing.</p><p class="standard">	"Then
lay down your weapons and approach slowly, with your hands raised,"
said Michael Kennedy.</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
raised his hands and began to step forward. Glenco didn't seem to
suspect anything, and he felt a little better about the whole thing,
at least until he noticed from the corner of his eye that the prince
was not moving at all.</p><p class="standard">	"You
as well," said Michael Kennedy.</p><p class="standard">	"No,"
the prince said.</p><p class="standard">	"What?
Repeat yourself!"</p><p class="standard">	"No!"
the prince declared. "I shall never lay down my blade at the
feet of such villains as you!"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
cringed. The plan was completely blown, and now they would have to
fight. 
</p><p class="standard">	He
felt his body become lighter, and he pushed off the ground, sliding
upward on a cushion of air, sketching a parabola straight from where
he had been to where Michael Kennedy stood, and came down with an axe
kick on the robot's brow. At the same moment Hanami and Mariko sprang
from their hiding places underneath the mercantile, which they had
spent twenty minutes sneaking through the village to obtain.</p><p class="standard">	"Fools!"
screamed Michael Kennedy. "Kill them!" He threw Yuji off
easily and punched Yuji in the face. Yuji headed off his blow with a
block, but was barely able to deflect it; it was like blocking an
iron bar. He skipped back, avoiding Michael Kennedy's punches,
bobbing and weaving, looking out for a kick. It finally came; Yuji
weaseled out of the way and immediately found himself facing a punch.
He didn't have enough time to dodge; he raised both arms to protect
his face. Michael Kennedy's fist crashed into the cross of his two
forearms with enough force that Yuji was knocked flat on his back. He
rolled over and scampered away before Michael Kennedy could rush to
his side and finish him, but Michael Kennedy pulled out of the lean
he'd done to punch Yuji on the ground and rushed him again, hooking a
left into Yuji's ribs. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji's
breath exploded from his lungs and he coughed twice before Michael
Kennedy's other fist came into his solar plexus. Pain burst across
chest. He coughed again, knowing another attack was coming, knowing
he could never avoid it. He braced himself.</p><p class="standard">	Michael
Kennedy grabbed him by the shirt and spun him around, sending him
stumbling off face-first into a pile of garbage. Yuji couldn't see.
His vision pulsed red and white. Each breath hurt. 
</p><p class="standard">	The
leader of Glenco seized him by the back of the shirt. Yuji had no
will to fight left. He felt stupid for having talked so big about
rescuing Akari and Sishica. He felt himself tossed off the pile of
garbage onto his back, then dragged across the square, like a sack of
corn. As he was dragged his vision cleared a bit, and he could see
blurry images of the others fighting. Hanami was doing well, fighting
Antonio Enr厲uez-Ibarra
and Jennifer Thompson at the same time. Mariko was hanging on against
Morqueeshah Stiles. The prince was desperately swinging a broken
sword at Gurpreet Singh. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
felt himself stop moving and then heard Michael Kennedy say, "I
don't know if you're conscious enough to know this, but your friends
will soon fall, just as you have."</p><p class="standard">	"Doesn't
matter," Yuji mumbled. "In a little while, reinforcements
are coming. They'll tear this village apart."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
not afraid of some primitives with spears," Michael Kennedy
scoffed. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Maybe
you should be," said Yuji. He put his hands down and pushed
himself up, almost managing to stand before Michael Kennedy pounded
his chest and knocked him back down. Yuji tried again. He saw Michael
Kennedy's fist coming down―his vision went out again―he
put up his hand and waited to feel bones crushing in his fingers―and
it never came.</p><p class="standard">	There
was a burning feeling in his chest. His ribs and his solar plexus
hurt twice as much as before, but his entire body felt hot and he
couldn't seem to stay still. He opened his eyes and saw that he'd
caught Michael Kennedy's fist. 
</p><p class="standard">	Michael
Kennedy tried to pull his fist away, but Yuji held on tight, and the
robot couldn't free his hand from Yuji's grip. Yuji yanked him down
and kicked upward, flipping the robot over onto its back. He
scrambled up and stomped on Michael Kennedy's head, saw the false
skin give way to wires and bolts, and he laughed, as short and sharp
as any that Yumiko had ever given.</p><p class="standard">	He
looked out of the hut and saw that the prince had been overcome and
lain in a hut across the way. Gurpreet Singh came toward Yuji,
wielding a jeweled scimitar. Yuji rushed him. Gurpreet raised the
scimitar and chopped straight down at Yuji's head. Yuji swung up his
hand and karate chopped through the blade, breaking it in half, and
in one fluid motion, swung his left leg into Gurpreet's side, grabbed
the broken half of blade from midair, and threw it spinning end over
end. The blade fragment stuck through Gurpreet Singh's eye. 
</p><p class="standard">	"My
optical sensor!" Gurpreet cried, and Yuji ran at him and
jump-kicked him in the chest, knocking him flat. He turned and began
searching for the next target, and caught sight of Morqueeshah Stiles
pounding on Mariko, whose face looked like a pound of ground beef,
although she was still standing and even getting in a few hits. Yuji
rushed to her side and grabbed Morqueeshah's arm in mid-blow. He
wrenched the robot's arm and heard the satisfying sound of metal
deforming. He slammed his fist into the robot's face three times in
quick succession and saw with each blow that its cheek collapsed
further, sucking its false human features toward the center of its
face. Maintaining his grip on its arm, he kicked into the robot's
stomach, separating the arm and the robot, and lifted the arm,
preparing to bludgeon the thing to death...</p><p class="standard">	"No!
No!" someone was screaming. Yuji ignored him long enough to
strike the robot over the head with its own arm a few times, breaking
the arm into several fragments of metal and rubber, but the robot
itself turned around and ran.</p><p class="standard">	"Retreat!"
Thuan Nguyen was yelling as he wheeled away in his chair, and
soldiers were streaming into the village square, knocking over anyone
in their way with the hafts of their spears, their leather helmets
pointed at the top like old American football helmets. 
</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
turned around and saw the hut where he'd left Michael Kennedy. One of
the others had grabbed their leader and dragged him off, but Yuji
could see the last of a phosphorescent blue glow, like the eerie
light of a single lamp cutting through the dark at the bottom of the
sea, fading away inside. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji,"
said Mariko, touching his shoulder, and Yuji jumped, suddenly back in
the moment. The screams of the elves and the yelling and grunting of
the soldiers filled his ears. Over the rest of the noise he heard the
prince giving orders and someone else shrieking over and over again,
at constant intervals, like a car alarm. He saw that the soldiers had
freed Akari and Sischica and were questioning them by the wooden
poles. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Hanami.
Hanami!" Yuji called, searching the crowd for a sight of her
maid uniform. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Here,
Master," said Hanami, approaching from his right. "I was
translating for the commander. We spoke with the village head."</p><p class="standard">	"What
did he have to say?" Mariko asked.</p><p class="standard">	"It
seems that Glenco was here with the complicity of some of the
influential members of the community. They did not, however, realize
that  Glenco was taking their children. Naturally, they believed that
Princess Terra was to blame."</p><p class="standard">	"Maybe
they were right," Yuji muttered as he looked around. The
soldiers, having finished knocking over and tying up every elf in the
square, were bashing down the doors of the hovels and dragging out
anyone inside. One pair was taking turns kicking a bound adult male
elf in the sides. A group of five was separating the men from the
women, bringing the latter into the mercantile and lining the square
with the former. 
</p><p class="standard">	"The
elves are angry with you," said Hanami.</p><p class="standard">	"Angry
with me? They're the idiots who let a group of psychotic
malfunctioning robots treat their village like a hracking motel!"
Yuji snapped. He glanced at Mariko, who didn't seem to want to look
him in the eye. 
</p><p class="standard">	"They
are angry because the soldiers witnessed you using their weapon
against Glenco," said Hanami.</p><p class="standard">	"That's
what that was? One of their weapons?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes.
Ordinarily, only those with at least a quarter elven blood are
capable of using them. They believe that you are a half- or
quarter-blood elf who joined with Princess Terra's forces and came
into the village disguised as a human so that you could find their
cache of technology and bring in the humans to take it."</p><p class="standard">	"Let
them think what they want," said Yuji. "I don't care. I
just want to get out of here."</p><p class="standard">	"As
you wish, Master. Shall we collect the young ones?"</p><p class="standard">	Sishica
and Akari both brightened when they saw the three of them
approaching, and Yuji was assaulted by two cries of "Mr.
Watanabe!" followed by an indistinguishable blur of speech from
two different directions. It seemed that Sishica served as the male
counterpart to both Ai and Akari.</p><p class="standard">	"Come
on, we're getting out of here," Yuji said over both of their
blathering. 
</p><p class="standard">	On
the way up the path towards where they'd left the van, they ran into
the prince, chatting with a soldier whose purple helmet plumage
suggested he was the commander. Yuji expected the prince to ignore
them and keep telling the commander about his heroic exploits during
the battle, or else make some disgusting comment about Ai, couched in
pseudo-Shakespearean language, but instead he looked up, a huge smile
on his mug, and cried out, "Master Watanabe! How delightful! I
regaled the commander just this moment with the tale of thy strength
and bravery!"</p><p class="standard">	"Oh.
Really?" Yuji could think of no other response.</p><p class="standard">	"Verily,
thine actions here have made thee over in mine eyes, a tremulous
child no longer, now a true warrior. And so, in recognition of thine
aid to me in battle, and of thine encounter with the fiendish devices
which those elves have hidden here, I shall make thee knight, a brave
one of Montagria. And after, thou mayst choose, from amongst the elf
maidens, she thou prefer for thy bedchamber, and take her to thy
home, as the first of many blessings thou shalt receive as a knight
in my service." The prince drew his sword―Yuji assumed
he'd gotten another one from one of the soldiers, since the sword
he'd had had been broken by Gurpreet Singh―and said, "Kneel,
Sir Watanabe, and rise more than thou knelt."</p><p class="standard">	"No
thanks," said Yuji. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Kneel!"
said the commander. "The prince confers on you a great honor!"</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't want it," said Yuji. "I don't want to be a knight. I
don't want an elf maiden for my bedchamber, or any other blessings.
If you'd like to thank me, please release Ai from her obligation to
marry you and let us all go home."</p><p class="standard">	"That
I cannot do," said the prince. "Nembris has pledged herself
to me, and even did I do as thou ask, she would not leave my side,
such has her fondness for me become."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
felt his hands tensing into fists at his sides and his jaw clenching
so tightly it was almost painful. "So," he said through
locked teeth, "She's so fond of you that you can even call her a
whore and threaten to beat her, and that fondness continues to grow
like pretty marigolds in her heart. Is that right?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
did no such thing!" the prince insisted. "To suggest such
is unbecoming a knight. But as thou be not yet a knight, I shall ask
one last time. Kneel, and receive just reward."</p><p class="standard">	"And
one last time, I'll say no," said Yuji. He tensed and relaxed
the muscles in his arm, trying to relieve the urge to punch Van in
the face until his skull caved in. "If you won't release Ai,
then please just let us go home." He was finding it more and
more difficult to keep a civil tongue; half of him wanted to say
something rude just to start a fight. He didn't know if the elven
weapon that had let him overcome Michael Kennedy, Gurpreet Singh, and
Morqueeshah Stiles was still turned on, but he still thought he could
kill the prince before the commander could stick a spear in him.</p><p class="standard">	Perhaps
the prince sensed the way Yuji was feeling; his fingers tensed around
the hilt of the sword and he raised it slightly, although not quite
into battle position. "Very well," he said. "Then go,
and take with thee the grace of Prince Vanadiel Thaddeus Egwimphron
of Montagria, and that of Princess Terra Theonia Oakenbrand of
Clarissia."</p><p class="standard">	"Much
obliged," said Yuji, and he walked past the prince and the
commander, keeping his attention on them even as he left, in case
they decided to attack from behind.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	Ai
was just finishing packing when Rekka entered the room.</p><p class="standard">	"So,
you're running away," said Rekka with a smirk.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
blushed and didn't look up from her suitcase. "I decided that
this was the best course. Akari and Sishica are rescued, and I don't
have to marry the prince."</p><p class="standard">	"Correct
me if I'm wrong, but you never actually told him you would marry him,
did you?"</p><p class="standard">	"It
was implied in our discussion. I didn't see any other way to get him
to help Akari and Sishica. And even if it wasn't explicitly
mentioned...I don't expect him to play fair. At worst he may have
been planning to drag me off tonight."</p><p class="standard">	"So
you've decided not to change sides? How unfortunate. Soon, I may be
coming for you. The Irlumarmitpa is too important for us."</p><p class="standard">	"You
may want to go after the prince first. I think he probably gave
Sishica and Akari to Glenco to force me into asking for his help."</p><p class="standard">	Rekka
sat down on the bed, leaned back on her hands, put one foot on a
velvet-seated wooden chair, and gave her red hair a toss. "He
didn't. My brother gave himself up to those robots of his own
accord."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
dropped the shirt she was holding. "Why?"</p><p class="standard">	"Our
mother ordered him. We foresaw some scenario like this and knew it
was a good chance to get you out of the way. But we underestimated
you. Your cowardice."</p><p class="standard">	Ai's
blush deepened. She knelt down, picked up the shirt, and placed it
very deliberately in the suitcase, avoiding looking at Rekka. "So
you thought if I were forced to go with Van to Montagria, I wouldn't
have the chance to backpedal on defecting and I'd be out of your way
for good."</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,"
said Rekka.</p><p class="standard">	"You
made Van think I came to him in the middle of the night and gave him
my virginity."</p><p class="standard">	"Yes.
I changed my physical body into your semblance. I can't transform to
look exactly like you, but it was dark, he was half-asleep, and we
looked enough alike that making myself a little taller and changing
my hair color a bit convinced him."</p><p class="standard">	"Did
your brother agree with this plan?" Ai asked.</p><p class="standard">	Rekka
shook her head. "No. He thought the best course was to show the
Irlumarmitpa what nice, kind, nurturing people we are. But having
lived our whole lives between one scheme and another, it's difficult
to change so suddenly. How could the people who put a family of
pirates like Vanadiel's in power ever pretend that? The truth is,
Sishica is the only one among us who is anything like nice, kind, and
nurturing."</p><p class="standard">	Ai
took the last few articles out of the drawers and stuffed them into
her suitcase, then tried to zip it shut. The zipper caught on a fold
of cloth halfway around, and Ai had to stuff everything further down
and try again. On the third try, she got it closed. "Did you
come here to try and stop me?"</p><p class="standard">	"No,"
said Rekka. "You and I both know I would have no chance of doing
that. For now."</p><p class="standard">	"That's
true," said Ai. "I won't kill you, but I can still scatter
your physical body and make you spend lots of energy rebuilding it."</p><p class="standard">	"And
how tedious for me," said Rekka. "No, I only came to see
you off, let you know that you've outsmarted us for now, and tell you
that you're a coward."</p><p class="standard">	"I
know that," said Ai. "I know I'm a coward. I know I always
try to run away. But for today, I'm a coward that outmaneuvered the
great and powerful elder ones. And for now, I'd rather be a coward
than a princess."</p><p class="standard">	</p><p class="standard">	The
ride back to the city was very peaceful. Yuji sat next to Mariko in
the middle seat and watched the sun disappear over the horizon out
the window. The younger two were in the back, asleep, with their
heads on each others' shoulders. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Mariko,"
said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Hm."</p><p class="standard">	"Did
you ever wonder why I went to that party?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
assumed because it was the only way to get out of Arishil's tree
without dying."</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
but didn't you ever wonder what she said to me at the party, up in
that little room?"</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
I assumed she told you she wanted you right there, and then the two
of you did it right on the floor and you pretended nothing happened,
but secretly in your mind, you―"</p><p class="standard">	"She
told me to stay away from Ai."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
sat up straight and adjusted her seat belt. "Did she say why?"</p><p class="standard">	"She
said that Ai was trying to kill me."</p><p class="standard">	"Did
she say why?"</p><p class="standard">	"No,
she said she couldn't tell me."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
laughed. "That's a cheap trick! She just wanted to get her rival
out of the way."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
not so sure," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"You're
serious? You think she might've been telling the truth? Come on! Then
if she told you I was trying to kill you, would you believe that?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shook his head. "No. But I might believe this."</p><p class="standard">	"You
believe that Ai is trying to kill you."</p><p class="standard">	"Maybe.
At first I thought it was ridiculous, but there was this feeling..."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
shrugged. "So there was this feeling. Ignore it and listen to
reason. Ai is not trying to kill you. How would she even be capable
of that? Poisoning the tea that she serves you after three kneeling
bows? Arishil is just screwing with you. Ignore it."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
shook his head. "No...Mariko, Ai is a nyvamna."</p><p class="standard">	Mariko
shrugged. "I know."</p><p class="standard">	"You
know? How did you know?"</p><p class="standard">	"She
figured us out just by looking at us. I figured she must have
something going on."</p><p class="standard">	"You
don't understand. She isn't just any nyvamna. She's more powerful
than either of us. She's the only reason I got through that meeting
with Arishil. She used her powers to disable Arishil's two servants
and came with me to Arishil's hideout so they couldn't do anything to
me while I was there."</p><p class="standard">	"Even
more reason for her to lie!" Mariko insisted. "Look, if Ai
was the only thing standing between you and her, she would want you
to mistrust Ai. That way maybe you trust her."</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't trust her."</p><p class="standard">	"But
according to her, you can't trust Ai. So you don't trust anyone. Then
you're all by yourself, isolated from anyone powerful enough to stop
Arishil from taking you. It's a scam. You know Ai; ignore Arishil and
trust your friend."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
smiled. That was exactly what he'd wanted to hear. That was why he'd
mentioned it to Mariko in the first place.</p><p class="standard"><br />

        <p class="standard">	Eventually,
he couldn't listen to any more of it. Watching a grown man sob wasn't
something he'd ever wanted to do. Well, not quite a grown man, but
eighteen-year-old boys were legal adults and morally, it was pathetic
enough if one burst into tears over a woman, no matter how much she'd
rocked his world, that Yuji felt it still qualified as a grown man
sobbing.</p><p class="standard">	"Man,
I...man, it's like, what did I do wrong, you know?" Allen
moaned, snot running down his face and tears down his cheeks.</p><p class="standard">	"Dunno."
Yuji took a swig from his bottle of crisis whiskey and offered it to
Allen. Maybe if he got drunk enough he'd shut up. Allen was about to
take the bottle when Yuji realized Allen was the type who talked more
the drunker he got, and pulled it away.</p><p class="standard">	"I
was in her play...I helped her watch those kids...I gave her
massages... What more could I have done?" Allen wondered aloud.</p><p class="standard">	"Did
you ever think of asking someone who knows? Like her, maybe?"
Yuji took another swig. The bottle was getting dangerously empty.
He'd only had four swigs and didn't feel nearly drunk enough to put
up with Allen yet.</p><p class="standard">	"I
did, but all she said was that it was fun and now it's over,"
Allen whimpered. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Did
you think maybe that's what it was? Fun that's now over?"</p><p class="standard">	"Whyyy?!"
His nasal whine reminded Yuji of a twelve-year-old girl's.</p><p class="standard">	"Because
all good things must come to an end." Yuji groped on his bed for
the remote, saw it was on the desk, and got up to get it. "But
some bad things just go on forever."</p><p class="standard">	"I
just don't understand," Allen went on. "We were going along
fine—we had sex in a different room of the hotel every night we
were there—then we did it in my parents' bed the first day we
were back, while they were gone—"</p><p class="standard">	"I
really don't need that level of detail," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"And
suddenly bang! The next day, she tells me it's all over! I mean,
what's up with that? I've had a boner that won't quit ever since! I
had to go in the bathroom at the department store just to—"</p><p class="standard">	"I
really, really don't need that level of detail," Yuji
interrupted more forcefully, and turned on the TV, hoping to shut
Allen up. The afternoon news was on, and Yuji was just about to
change the channel when he heard the one thing that would induce him
to watch the afternoon news.</p><p class="standard">	"...the
word 'Glenco' on the walls in what appears to be blood," the
solid, middle American reporter reported into his microphone from the
scene. "No one is sure what to make of this, but the police are
keeping their eyes open for anyone matching those descriptions."</p><p class="standard">	"Okay,
keep us updated on that. Thanks, Doug," said the pretty
Brazilian female newscaster from the studio. "Coming up next, a
dog that—"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
changed the channel until he found a local station that hadn't shown
the story yet and stopped to listen through Allen's continued whining
and whimpering.</p><p class="standard">	"...mysterious
multiple murder in an apartment building in the Elizabethan Quarter's
South Area. For more, let's go to Li Myung-Bai at the scene,"
said the pretty Libyan female newscaster from the studio.</p><p class="standard">	"Thanks
Carla," said the solid, Korean middle American reporter. "I'm
standing here in front of an apartment building in Elquaso that was
the scene of a horrific crime late last night." The building
behind him was the sort of working-class four floor building that
Yuji and Allen had never had to live in, the kind where single
mothers struggling to make it on minimum wage jobs lived alongside
those who had turned to Welfare fraud or given up and gone into
prostitution, the kind where the carpet is always brown or bright
yellow, the cupboards are always full of Twinkies and cockroaches,
and the landlord never knows how to fix anything, but always knows
where to get a fix.</p><p class="standard">	"Late
last night, a group of assailants broke into this building and
executed a horrific killing spree," the reported continued as he
made his way up to the front door of the building. "They bashed
down the front door and the door of Apartment 101, occupied by a
couple and their two teenage daughters." The reporter passed
through the front lobby into the apartment, and the camera swept over
the wreck of a room littered with broken glass, cans of soup, and the
Styrofoam peanuts inside beanbag chairs. "The assailants bound
and gagged all four and proceeded to sexually assault them,
penetrating them  with foreign objects. The two daughters and the
husband were then strangled to death and their bodies thrown into the
lobby. The wife called 9-0-0 while the assailants went to another
apartment and repeated the process. In each apartment they penetrated
all occupants with foreign objects and then strangled or bludgeoned
all except one."</p><p class="standard">	"Did
the ones left alive remember what their attackers looked like?"
the female newscaster asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
several reported seeing a Chinese or Vietnamese teenager in a
wheelchair, and we also had several reports of an Indian teenager
with his hair in a wrap, wearing an eye patch. We also had
miscellaneous reports of an African-American girl and a Hispanic boy
with a knife. The police tell me that some of the victims were
stabbed multiple times before being killed, but so far no
fingerprints or DNA evidence of any kind has surfaced." 
</p><p class="standard">	"Okay,
thanks Myung-Bai," said the newscaster.</p><p class="standard">	"You're
welcome, Carla," returned the reported.</p><p class="standard">	"Okay,
coming up, a kid who—"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
picked up the remote before they could hear what the kid had done and
changed to the satellite radio jazz channel. The sounds of
saxophones, trumpets, pianos, and guitars filled his room.</p><p class="standard">	"Ugh,"
Allen said, distracted from his whining. "How can you listen to
that crap?"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
took another drink from his bottle. "Hey, Allen, do you think
robots shave with electric razors?"</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	Even
the saxophones couldn't drown Allen out, so Yuji eventually told him
he was going upstairs to get something to eat and would be back in a
few minutes. He had planned to sneak out the backdoor and run until
he had come somewhere that Allen would never find him, like the next
town, but Allen had just followed him up the stairs to continue
whining.  Yuji looked around the kitchen for something to eat, with
Allen sitting at the kitchen table whining, until he was saved by
Hanami's return from grocery shopping.</p><p class="standard">	"...and
when she was done sucking she—Hello, who might you be?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
am Hanami," the robot maid replied, favoring Allen with an
emotionless stare. "I assume you are Allen Sternheim. I've been
told about you."</p><p class="standard">	"I
should've told you to bar him entrance," Yuji muttered.</p><p class="standard">	"Where
did you get the money to hire a maid to do your grocery shopping?"
Allen asked.</p><p class="standard">	"She's
a robot. Ai reprogrammed her to obey me. Hanami, did you happen to
get any yatsuhashi?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
waited for her to tell him where they were. "Where are they?"
he asked, giving up.</p><p class="standard">	"Here."</p><p class="standard">	"Wait,
wait, wait. You're a robot maid," said Allen.</p><p class="standard">	"Yes."
Hanami began putting away groceries while Yuji sat down across from
Allen to eat cookies.</p><p class="standard">	"Since
when have robot maids existed?"</p><p class="standard">	"Do
you wish to ask how long robots have existed, or how long they have
been maids?" Hanami asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Both!
Respectively, in the order just enumerated," said Allen. "Then
I wish to ask your number."</p><p class="standard">	"Her
number is my number," said Yuji. "She lives her."</p><p class="standard">	"She
lives here? Is she—Hanami! Are you fully functional?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
cannot infer the meaning of your inquiry. In answer to your first
question, my kind first came into being over two thousand years ago.
My particular model came into production fifty years ago, but I
myself have been operating only twenty years. We became maids five
hundred years ago, when we became sufficiently numerous that there
were more of us than needed to perform our original tasks."</p><p class="standard">	"Was
your original task naughty?" Allen leered.</p><p class="standard">	"If
you mean to imply that we were put to sexual use, no, not originally.
We were put to that use slightly before our use as domestic servants
began. I myself fulfilled that role for five years after I was built.
However, our original tasks were related to scientific research and
war: data processing, long-running research, battlefield
reconnaissance, search and rescue, and special operations. I have
also performed the latter task."</p><p class="standard">	"Oh
ho ho! So you've got a former sex robot living with you, eh?"
said Allen, attempting to elbow Yuji from across the table. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
have to admire your adaptability," said Yuji. "A second
ago, you were whining and moaning about your broken heart. Now your
leer looks like it's going to split your head in half."</p><p class="standard">	The
phone rang, and Yuji got up to get it, grateful for an escape. He
went out of the kitchen to where the phone sat on its end table and
picked it up. "Hello?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji?"
came Mariko's voice. "Did you see the news?"</p><p class="standard">	"About
Glenco? Yeah. I was just about to call you about that, actually, but
I have a rather annoying jilted boyfriend here..."</p><p class="standard">	"I
think we should fight them."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
stopped. When he regained his voice, he said, "You're blunt
today. But you must've known what I'd say. No."</p><p class="standard">	"Then
let's at least go to the police with what we know."</p><p class="standard">	"What
good would it do? We'd just look like lunatics. Besides, do you think
the police can actually do anything about Glenco, even if they wanted
to? The police in this town couldn't even handle Miba, remember?"</p><p class="standard">	"Exactly!
We're the only ones who can do anything about them!" Mariko said
vehemently. "We know the police are useless. You and I defeated
Miba, not once but twice. And we defeated Glenco too, at least badly
enough to drive them off—"</p><p class="standard">	"Maybe
you felt like you were effective, but I sure wasn't," said Yuji.
"Face it, Mariko. If not for that elven weapon hidden under the
floorboards, we all would've been dead, including the prince."</p><p class="standard">	"The
prince wouldn't let Ai come," said Mariko. "You said she's
an esper. You said she was so powerful even the great and powerful
princess of the magical fairy people is afraid of her."</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
if that's what you were leading up to, you're destined to be
disappointed. I haven't talked to Ai since we got back, and she's
even more reluctant to fight anything than I am."</p><p class="standard">	"No,
you're just a coward!" Mariko snapped. "You're just afraid
to do anything because you don't want to be responsible for what
might happen afterward!"</p><p class="standard">	"No,
it's because I don't see what good it does anyone to get ourselves
killed trying to act like goddamned Dirty Harry!" Yuji returned.
"Anyway, you want to try and convince Armadillo Girl, go ahead.
I haven't been able to get a hold of her for the past three days,
although I know she got back safely, since she left some rambling
message on my answering machine."</p><p class="standard">	"Yuji,
look, I'm sorry for getting mad," Mariko said, sighing. "It's
not that I'm not afraid of dying. I know we didn't do so well against
Glenco last time. But one of the things that scares me more than
dying is the thought that I might've let other people die when I
could've done something about it."</p><p class="standard">	"You
can't do anything about it," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"God,
you're impossible!" Yuji heard a click, and then a dial tone. He
hung up the phone and went back into the kitchen. Unfortunately,
Allen was still there.</p><p class="standard">	"Dude!
I was just hearing from your maid about what happened on the trip.
How could you go off and fight robots without me? So that's what that
story on the news was all about. Was that McKinley just now on the
phone? Are you guys forming a posse to get rid of them? Come on, let
me come this time! I—"</p><p class="standard">	"Get
out," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"—want
to see you kick some—"</p><p class="standard">	"Get
out!" Yuji grabbed Allen by the shoulders, plucked him out of
the chair, put him on his feet, and pushed him towards the door.</p><p class="standard">	"Okay,
fine, geez..." Allen left without further struggle.</p><p class="standard">	"Master
Yuji, what would you like me to do?" Hanami asked.</p><p class="standard">	"I
don't know. Vacuum the living room or something. Just leave me alone.
I'm going back to my room."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	"So
your trip was good," said Yumiko. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Uh-huh,"
Akari answered. Then she whispered, <i>"Whore..."</i></p><p class="standard">
	"What?"</p><p class="standard">
	"I
just said it was. Are you all right, Yumiko-neesan?"</p><p class="standard">
	"Y-yeah.
I'm fine." Yumiko cut off a piece of pancake, ran it through the
pile of syrup on her plate, and ate it. She wasn't a great cook, and
she'd never made pancakes before, but it had been so long since she'd
had them that they tasted good anyway, even if they were bland and a
bit tough. 
</p><p class="standard">
	Akari
set down her empty coffee cup and was about to get up and pour
herself more. "Oh, let me get that for you," said Yumiko.</p><p class="standard">
	"Thanks,"
Akari said with a smile. <i>Whore</i>, she added again under her
breath as Yumiko refilled her cup.</p><p class="standard">
	Yumiko
deliberately ignored it as she made herself another cup of herbal
tea. She sat down again, taking a deep whiff of the scent of
chamomile rising from the cup before she drank deeply, savoring the
weedy, slightly bitter flavor of the tea. 
</p><p class="standard">
	"How
was your week?" Akari asked, cautiously. Yumiko hated that
cautious note, as if Akari thought she was a dangerous sociopath who
might kill her for saying something without the right note of
humility. She held herself back from snapping.</p><p class="standard">
	"Good.
Things were pretty busy at work." That was an understatement for
the hellish week she'd just passed, if not an outright lie, but Akari
just nodded, smiled, and drank more coffee. Yumiko wondered if her
grandfather had let her drink coffee like that when she lived with
him, and if that was why she was so short. Then Akari whispered <i>"Blew
a lot of guys, huh?"</i></p><p class="standard">
<i>	</i>Yumiko
set down her knife and fork, no longer hungry although she still had
a fourth of a pancake on her plate. "Speaking of work, I'd
better get going," she said. "There's more coffee in the
coffee maker, and one more pancake by the stove. <i>Go-yukkuri</i>,"
she added, trying to be accommodating to Akari's urge to speak
Japanese.</p><p class="standard">
	"<i>Gochisousama
deshita</i>," Akari returned. "<i>Ittekimasu!</i>"</p><p class="standard">
	Yumiko
couldn't remember the return phrase, so she just waved awkwardly and
tried to hurry out the door without looking like she was trying to
hurry. 
</p><p class="standard">
	She
made it out to the front steps when her phone rang. It was Mariko.
Yumiko prayed for good news, as she certainly had none, and answered
it.</p><p class="standard">
	"No
luck," said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">
	"Dammit!
He wouldn't even contact Ai?"</p><p class="standard">
	"He
hasn't had any better luck with her than I have," said Mariko. 
</p><p class="standard">
	"Well,
nothing here either. I'm trying, but it'll take a little more than a
few cups of coffee and some pancakes to make up for everything I did
to her..." Yumiko glanced over her shoulder at the door. "I
haven't even been able to tell her the truth about Eutsler. Maybe I
ought to just go back to him before he sends those robots to kill any
more people."</p><p class="standard">
	"You're
sure that's what he wants?" Mariko said.</p><p class="standard">
	"Yeah,
I'm pretty sure."</p><p class="standard">
	"You
know, I've been wondering, why does he still want you so much? You're
not young enough for a pedo like him anymore, and he's got the police
in his hip pocket, he can't be afraid of you turning him in...Why do
you think he's still so keen?"</p><p class="standard">
	Her
first instinct was to run: just hang up the phone, throw it into the
bushes, and run. She fought with herself, quelling that impulse, and
made herself sit down on the steps, her chest tight. "I'm sorry,
Mariko..."</p><p class="standard">
	"Sorry
for what? Don't apologize for getting me involved, because I got
myself involved."</p><p class="standard">
	"No...I
mean I haven't been straight with you. I think I know why he's after
me even after all this time." She took a deep breath. "You've
been to Eutsler's main operation over in Ode, right?" 
</p><p class="standard">
	"Yeah."</p><p class="standard">
	"Me
and Akari, our father was a lawyer. He worked for the district
attorney's office in Ode. He was pretty high up, too; he was close to
running for district attorney himself when he was killed."</p><p class="standard">
	"Killed?"</p><p class="standard">
	"Yeah,
I told you he ran off with his new girlfriend. That's what my mom
told me, okay?"</p><p class="standard">
	"Who
killed him?"<br />	"Eutsler. He had evidence linking Eutsler
to a child porn operation. The city wanted him to bury it, but he
wasn't going along, he was going to take the case to the high court,
where they'd prosecute it. Eutsler tried everything to soonow him; he
even tried donating money to my father's campaign for district
attorney. When nothing worked, Eutsler started threatening him, and
when that didn't work, he started plotting to actually kill him."</p><p class="standard">
	"How
did you find this out?"</p><p class="standard">
	"Eutsler
told me. When he found out who I was, he wanted to gloat. Lord it
over his old enemy one more time, I guess. You know the worst part?
It was my mother, that <i>bitch</i>,"—Yumiko hissed the
word, filling it with venom—"who betrayed him. She met
Eutsler at a fundraiser and was shaberooing him for months while they
planned it. It was a backudon in the end—they put it in the car
next to his while he was at work and ran a trip wire between the two
door handles. He came up to get in and that was it." Yumiko was
disgusted to find she was crying. She tried to steady her voice
before she spoke again. "It was—how did she do it?"
she burst out. "Akari was still sucking her tits when she did
it—how could she fuck the man who wanted to kill him one minute
and nurse his child the next? That's where she gets all this damn
money from—Eutsler set her up like a queen over here as a
reward for helping him. She still calls him up to fuck
sometimes...like she did the other day..." Yumiko stopped to
breathe and realized Mariko had been talking while she raved, trying
to comfort her.</p><p class="standard">
	"It's
all right...It's all okay...Don't worry about it now," Mariko
was saying.</p><p class="standard">
	Yumiko
took two deep breaths. Her mascara was probably running, but she
didn't want to go back into the house and be seen by Akari. "You
took care of Kyoko and Kirino, but Eutsler hasn't given up yet.
That's why he brought those robots here from the Outer Rim. I don't
know if Eutsler knows Akari's here, but you say the robots saw her
and if he can, I don't know, download their memories or something and
see pictures of her, he'll probably put two and two together and
realize who she is. Eutsler paid that cunt's legal fees when she
fought my grandfather for her—that's why my grandfather didn't
take me—so he knows she exists."</p><p class="standard">
	"Don't
take this the wrong way, but you didn't seem too worried when she
first came," said Mariko. 
</p><p class="standard">
	"She's
an irritating little rich girl who confuses anime with reality, but
that doesn't mean I want Eutsler to get a hold of her. Please,
Mariko, do anything you can to convince Stew Boy and Ai to help
you—and if you don't, I'll go back to Eutsler. I'll make him
promise not to touch her."</p><p class="standard">
	"Do
you think he'll keep his word?"</p><p class="standard">
	"He's
kept that bitch on ten thousand dollars a month for twelve years, so
at least he keeps his promises," said Yumiko. 
</p><p class="standard">
	"I
won't let you go back to him. I'll get them out there somehow."</p><p class="standard">
	"Thanks.
Listen, I've got to get to work. Call me if anything happens."</p><p class="standard">
<br />
</p><p class="standard">
	The
noise of the vacuum cleaner had stopped long after the last of Yuji's
crisis scotch was inside him. He felt as if he were a pressure cooker
on a slow boil, the pressure building up inside him. At the moment he
was calm, but anything might make him explode.</p><p class="standard">
	Mariko
couldn't expect him to go out and face death. It was one thing
fighting off a schoolyard bully who wasn't even a nyvamna. It was
quite another to go against a group of robot murderers which had
badly beaten him the last time they'd fought and, in an act of
futility, die on principle. The worst part was what they'd do to his
body afterwards; they'd probably dissect him and make a five-step
pyramid on avoiding all his numerous health flaws. Maybe Mariko could
stand that, knowing she'd died failing at doing what she thought was
right, but Yuji couldn't. 
</p><p class="standard">
	A
timid hand knocked against the door. Thinking it was Allen (Hanami
gave very assertive knocks, like a policeman), Yuji yelled "Go
away!"</p><p class="standard">
	The
door began to open. "Go—" Yuji started when he saw light
glint off a strand of red-golden hair. The head it was attached to
appeared in the crack of the door, eyes fixed on the carpet. "May
I come in?"</p><p class="standard">
	"I
told you to go away." She was about to when for no reason Yuji
found himself growling "Wait. Get back in here and say what
you've got to say, then get the hell out."</p><p class="standard">
	Ai
came in, hands folded in front of her skirt, eyes still towards the
carpet.  She seemed afraid, and Yuji, to his later shame, enjoyed
that. He was afraid; Mariko was afraid; wasn't it funny that someone
who could easily kill both of them and any enemy they might face was
afraid of <i>him</i>? 
</p><p class="standard">
	"First,
I, um, I, um, want to apologize for not answering your calls or
coming by. And, um, if you talk to Mariko please pass that on to her.
Also, please let her know I'm sorry for hiding when she came by the
other day."</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji
frowned. "Mariko's one thing, but don't apologize to me. If you
feel bad, just consider Hanami a preemptive makeup present. If I'm
gonna have to run around all over the goddamn place, at least now I
don't have to clean the house before I go anymore."</p><p class="standard">
	This
seemed to encourage Ai, who looked a little less frightened. Yuji
twirled his hand, signaling her to go on, and she started. "Um,
the prince—"</p><p class="standard">
	"What
about the prince?" Yuji asked.</p><p class="standard">
	She
waited, seeming to want for the right words. When they came out, Yuji
didn't know why they'd been so hard to think of. "I...I..."
Her voice was quavering. "I didn't want to marry him at all,"
she burst out. She took several deep breaths, as if getting through
those words had been a sprint.</p><p class="standard">
	"Why
not?" Yuji asked, genuinely curious. "He was the prince of
a third-world country, you'd have money and power—three hundred
pairs of shoes, or your own MASH jumbo jet. You could've even had me
executed for making fun of you all those times."</p><p class="standard">
	"Because...when
we were at the hotel, he cornered me in the laundry room," said
Ai. "He insisted I was in his room the night before, that
we'd...done it...and he said by the laws of his country, we had to be
married. He took me by the arm, and I wasn't sure what to do; I was
afraid he'd hurt me."</p><p class="standard">
	"Why
didn't you just throw a reality bubble and vaporize him?"</p><p class="standard">
	"Is
that why you didn't try to help?" Ai asked quietly. Yuji tried
to hide his surprise and failed. <i>Well, yeah, </i>he told himself,
<i>she's an esper who can detect emotions. </i>
</p><p class="standard">
	He
waited for her to say something. She didn't, just staring at him like
a child who's been told she's not getting anything for Christmas this
year. Yuji looked away, unable to look her in the eyes.</p><p class="standard">
	"I
didn't suspect anything when he brought me down, but even when he
became threatening, I thought I'd be all right because you were
there. But you didn't even try to help me."</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji
glanced up, trying to meet her eyes, and found that now she was
looking away, at the tree outside the window. He felt the bile rising
in his throat. "If he'd tried anything, I would have jumped out
and yelled. I would have stopped him from hurting you." <i>You
should be the one saying this to me, </i>he thought.</p><p class="standard">
	She
shook her head, and Yuji couldn't tell if she believed him or not.
For his part, he wasn't sure whether he was lying or not. "Look...I
believe you that you weren't in his room, but <i>someone</i> was,
because the night before, when you came out to chase Glenco and found
me outside his room, I was looking in at him with a girl that even I
thought was you. The next morning I thought it was all a dream or a
hallucination."</p><p class="standard">
	"It
wasn't," said Ai. "You were led down to that laundry room
by one of Arishil's children, right? It was the boy, wasn't it."</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji
nodded.</p><p class="standard">
	"The
girl, Rekka, it was her. They can transform their outer appearances,
within certain limits, but it takes time and energy. She made herself
look enough like me and sneaked into the prince's room."</p><p class="standard">
	"That's
wrong in so many ways."</p><p class="standard">
	"The
prince's plan after I denied being in his room was exactly what he
tried—to force me to marry him in exchange for defeating
Glenco—"</p><p class="standard">
	"Which
you got around by running away—congratulations, Sir Robin,"
Yuji interrupted.</p><p class="standard">
	"—so
the boy surrendered himself to Glenco to help the prince. Do you
think Akari surrendered herself too?" Ai asked. Yuji was almost
disgusted with how fast she'd forgiven him for not doing anything in
the laundry room. She hadn't seemed to buy his story, truth or lie
(he still wasn't sure himself), yet she didn't seem the least bit
angry anymore.</p><p class="standard">
	"I
don't know what Akari would have to gain," said Yuji, "but
I seem to know one thing you don't: the prince himself brought Glenco
to the island just so he could use that plan."</p><p class="standard">
	"I
suspected, but I couldn't be sure," said Ai. "And now
they're here somehow...Do you think he sent them to get me?"</p><p class="standard">
	"Possibly,"
said Yuji. "But if you're through being mad—"</p><p class="standard">
	"I
never said I was through," said Ai, but she smiled slightly.</p><p class="standard">
	"—would
you mind letting me know why you didn't just tell the prince to hrack
off from the beginning?"</p><p class="standard">
	"I
was afraid," said Ai. "The truth is, my father and brothers
work for the CIA."</p><p class="standard">
	"I'd
be more surprised if they didn't," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">
	"Prince
Vanadiel is one of the CIA's regional allies. He's always been
cooperative with their aims in the Outer Rim, and he's provided them
with whatever elven technology he could get—which has always
been less than they wanted, since his ancestors thoroughly expunged
elves from his island. Anyway, he told us a little while ago that he
wanted to marry one of our nyvamna as repayment for his loyalty. It
seems he saw me in one of their personnel books and, um, became
attached to me..." She started blushing. Yuji was amazed it had
taken her this long. "So I was under some pressure to accept the
offer."</p><p class="standard">
	"Then
you work for the CIA too?"</p><p class="standard">
	"No,
but since my family does, they keep tabs on me like I do."</p><p class="standard">
	"Doesn't
seem too smart, having one of their most powerful married off to the
violent absolute monarch of a third-world country, no matter how
staunch an ally he's been," Yuji mused. "Like marrying
Chelsea Clinton to Saddam Hussein."</p><p class="standard">
	He
pressed on with Ai's earlier remark about Akari, somehow feeling the
need to defend Akari. "Listen, I know you think Akari's an evil
genius, and maybe she is—well, I know she is, you were right
about her planning Yumiko's whole mental breakdown—but I just
don't see what she would have to gain. You really think she gave
herself up to Glenco to force you to marry the prince?"</p><p class="standard">
	"I
didn't plan to, but it did seem like a convenient way to make you
guys fight Glenco," said Akari from the doorway.</p><p class="standard">
	"You—how
long have you been standing there?" Yuji demanded.</p><p class="standard">
	"Since
the first time Ren-chan guessed the right answer about me and
Sishica," said Akari. "Mr. Watanabe! I'm so glad you think
I'm an evil genius, but please don't spread all my secrets around,
okay?" She winked and put a finger to her lips like an anime
character. 
</p><p class="standard">
	"You
dirty little—"</p><p class="standard">
	"Can
you please not be mad, Mr. Watanabe? I have something important to
tell you both. I know who's commanding Glenco!"</p><p class="standard">
<br />
</p><p class="standard">
	Akari
wanted to have tea and cake while she told the story, but Yuji
insisted on story now and tea and cake afterwards, so after giving
Akari his chair, seating Ai in the chair Allen had recently occupied,
and sitting down on the bed himself, Akari began talking.</p><p class="standard">
	"Ever
since I got back, it seems like Neesan has been trying to be nice to
me. Maybe she knows I set her up. Eh-heh~!"</p><p class="standard">
	"You're
trying to be cutesy about driving her to suicide?" Yuji
commented.</p><p class="standard">
	"She
made breakfast for us this morning and actually tried to sit down and
talk, but something seemed to be bothering her the whole time and she
left for work early. Her phone rang on the way out and I heard her
talking to Marie-neechan, sounding all poka-poka. I brought my cup of
coffee, cracked the door a little, and listened to the whole thing.
It went like this: Marie-neechan: 'No luck'. Yumi-neesan: 'Dammit! He
wouldn't even contact Ai?' Marie-neechan..."</p><p class="standard">
	Akari
recited the entire conversation to them like that, as if reading from
a screenplay. She even mimicked Mariko's and Yumiko's tone and
inflection and gave a spirited reenactment of Yumiko's anger at their
mother. Photographic memory was rather creepy, Yuji thought. At the
end, he summed it up.</p><p class="standard">
	"So
this Eutsler person—the same one you convinced your mother to
bang again just to screw with Yumiko—has some weird obsession
with Yumiko, and now he's commanding Glenco, your sister thinks to
get her back, and she's willing to go back to keep him away from you
even though she was willing to kill herself to stay away from him
before?" Yuji didn't want to say in front of Akari that he
didn't really believe the story about their father either—it
sounded to him like something poached from a Batman comic.</p><p class="standard">
	"I
think she just expects you two and Marie-neechan to take care of
Glenco so she doesn't have to go back," said Akari.</p><p class="standard">
	"How
are we even supposed to know who he is?"</p><p class="standard">
	"Marie-neechan
seems to know."</p><p class="standard">
	"I
know, and so do you, Yuji," said Ai. "I...have to confess
something. I was in the card club the night you and Allen came to get
that card."</p><p class="standard">
	"Why
were <i>you</i> there?"</p><p class="standard">
	"Um,
errand for the CIA. One of their agents who works out here, observing
the Outer Rim, set himself up as an accountant and game master.
Eutsler was the man in the Chinese robes who was presiding over the
place."</p><p class="standard">
	"You
sure do a lot of things for the CIA, for not being one of their
agents," Yuji commented. "Things are sort of making sense,
though. When I went to return that card to Mr. Tanaka, I saw a
picture of his son. It was the prince."</p><p class="standard">
	"He's
the king?" Akari asked.</p><p class="standard">
	"No,
you dolt. The prince set everything up. He's connected to Eutsler.
Tanaka probably had the picture because he's one of the prince's
citizens, and I bet they're all required by law to have a picture of
their Dear Leader somewhere in the house; he just had one where the
prince was dressed up like one of us so it wouldn't look out of
place. It was probably part of the prince's plan to get us to his
party so he could put the moves on Ai. Eutsler probably gave Hans the
card in the first place."</p><p class="standard">
	"Then,
is the CIA okay with us defeating Eutsler?" Akari asked. "After
all, if he works with their best friend the prince..."</p><p class="standard">
	"They
may not be," said Ai, "but I don't work for them, so they
can't bind—why are you shaking your head, Yuji?"</p><p class="standard">
	"I'm
shaking my head because I don't remember ever agreeing to fight
Glenco," said Yuji. "Sure, maybe we know who's commanding
them now, but we know who's commanding Arishil's flunkies too; that
doesn't mean we can do anything about them. Only one thing's changed:
instead of standing in the street yelling for them to show
themselves, we can go straight to where they live and yell for them
to show themselves. Then they'll kill us, just like they would have
done on Clarissia if not for that elven weapon just happening to be
under the floorboards and me just happening to fall on it."</p><p class="standard">
	"We
have to try!" Akari insisted.</p><p class="standard">
	"We
don't!" Yuji countered. "Your best bet, and Yumiko's, is to
get out of town—go away from Eutsler, not towards him. Go back
to your grandfather. As for the rest of us, Eutsler doesn't know or
care anything about us. Assuming Glenco isn't pissed enough to ignore
his orders, we're safe."</p><p class="standard">
	"But...I
don't want to just run away for the rest of my life," Akari
said.</p><p class="standard">
	"You
don't have a choice. Did you see how completely beaten by Glenco I
was? I—" Yuji paused, realizing his hands were balled into
fists and his arms were trembling, from fear or anger, he didn't
know. He tried to slow down his breathing and, with an effort,
relaxed the muscles in his hands before he continued. "I never
feared being beaten; I was just afraid of getting out of control and
hurting someone else. I've never been that afraid in my life."
He made himself look Akari straight in the eye. "You can't do
anything about this. Even if we are nyvamna, our powers are limited.
We can still bleed. We can still die. Take Yumiko and go back to your
grandfather. It's your only chance."</p><p class="standard">
	"Wait..."
Ai glanced at Akari, at Yuji, and then at the armrest of her chair,
becoming interested in a loose thread. "I'll do it."</p><p class="standard">
	"You
will," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">
	"Yes.
I'll destroy Glenco."</p><p class="standard">
	"Why
the sudden change of heart?"</p><p class="standard">
	Ai
picked compulsively at the loose thread. "They're only machines.
Somebody cast them and bolted them together and wrote C code to make
them seem to think, only they overran an array or forgot to free some
memory somewhere, and now their machines are broken."</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji
clapped his hands. "You're not just a D&amp;D nerd, but also a
computer nerd."</p><p class="standard">
	Ai
blushed and shook her head. At first Yuji thought she meant she
wasn't a computer nerd, but then realized she was telling him not to
interrupt. "If we can get all of them to face us at once, I can
throw a reality bubble around us and get rid of all of them. I'll
just think of it like I'm running the machine that squeezes cars into
cubes at the junkyard."</p><p class="standard">
	"Then
do it," said Yuji. "Get rid of them."</p><p class="standard">
	"I...I
can't do it alone," said Ai.</p><p class="standard">
	"Mariko
will help you. She's been trying to contact you just for that this
whole time. She'll be eager to do it. Even if she dies, she'll have
died happy. Go. Use my phone on the way out, if you want. But I'm not
coming."</p><p class="standard">
	"Mr.
Watanabe—" Akari began, but Ai raised a hand and silenced her. 
</p><p class="standard">
	"I
see," she said. "So you're just going to hide in the
laundry cart again." She stood up and left the room.</p><p class="standard">
	"You
coward," Akari accused, her voice wooden.</p><p class="standard">
	"The
old 'what are you, chicken' tactic, beloved since the 1950s. Do you
know how many stupid things people have been convinced to do by that?
It's not gonna work on me."</p><p class="standard">
	"I
don't know how you'll live with yourself, Mr. Watanabe," she
said, and turned around to leave and join Ai.</p><p class="standard">
<br />
</p><p class="standard">
	Dusk
had started to fall when the guilt kicked in. It wasn't Akari's last
cliché that caused it, though; it was what Ai had said.</p><p class="standard">
	That
was the conclusion he came to as the rays of sunlight streaming
through the tree outside his window and running across his carpet
lengthened and thinned, and the fog of the twenty ounces of scotch
he'd drunk that morning to drown out Allen lifted from his mind.
Something about that encounter earlier had left him feeling like he
had a giant chunk ripped out of his chest. He'd spent the last
while—he wasn't sure how long it had been, though it must have
been at least a few hours—staring at the blank television
screen and running back over the encounter, searching for the key.
And now he had it: it had to have been when he told Ai that he would
have intervened if she'd been in serious danger from the prince. By
now he was pretty sure he'd been lying, and for some reason that made
him feel bad; he was also pretty sure that Ai had figured out he was
lying, even as bad a judge of character as she was, and that made him
feel bad too. 
</p><p class="standard">
	After
all, if he'd been telling the truth, he wouldn't have refused to
guard her from Glenco, a much greater danger than the prince, when
she was doing her best to get rid of them.</p><p class="standard">
	It
was stupid to feel that way, he told himself. Why should he have to
guard her against anything, when she was infinitely more powerful
than he was? All this time he'd been fooled by her innocuous
appearance, a small, soft fifteen-year-old girl, doll-like features,
pretty hair, innocent, seemingly naïve and easy to take in. All
of it was a lie. She was smarter than him—had been the only one
to see through Akari's scheme—and had rescued him from
Arishil's people when he couldn't do anything. She was Superman
combined with Batman; Yuji was, at best, Robin combined with Robin.
Though at the moment, he felt more like Jimmy Olsen.</p><p class="standard">
	He
wanted more crisis scotch, but the nearest liquor store was several
blocks away and he didn't feel like going out. He wanted to do
something to let him stop thinking about killer robots and carob
espers, but nothing promised adequate distraction.</p><p class="standard">
	The
door opened. Yuji looked up to see who it was, expecting Hanami or
possibly his mother. It was his father, looking as Yuji had always
remembered him: smooth, impassive, unshakeable, his hair slicked back
against his skull, his suit neat and tastefully cut. Once his father
had dived into a pool to pull out a drowning toddler and come out,
and still, through some magic trick, his hair was still slicked back,
and his suit was still neat, even sopping wet.</p><p class="standard">
	"Good
evening," said Yuji's father.</p><p class="standard">
	"Good
evening," Yuji replied.</p><p class="standard">
	"Where
are your mother and Shoko?"</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji
shrugged. "Mom's still at work, I expect, and God only knows
where Shoko is. Probably in the back seat of some old man's car."</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji's
father took a small clock from inside his jacket. It was a miniature
wall clock, a trio of plastic hands clicking along across the white
face, which had no numbers, but only black lines indicating hours and
minutes. Yuji's father set it on the dresser and watched it for a
moment. The ticking filled the silence of the room, a monotonous
progression of tick, then tock, tick, then tock. Yuji felt his
desires, the desire for alcohol, the desire to forget or distract
himself, all of them eroded a little with each tick, and receded a
little with each tock. He felt the fog return, blowing a little over
his mind with each tick, pausing with each tock.</p><p class="standard">
	"I
assume you've seen the news," Yuji's father said abruptly.</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji
nodded. "Do you know about Glenco?"</p><p class="standard">
	"I
know a little more than you do, I think," Yuji's father replied.
"They were made by humans, did you know that? In fact, they were
made by Americans. Certain members of the CIA were persuaded to share
some of the elven technology which their relationship with Montagria
yielded them with private companies. The android technology is one of
the few they've had any luck with; the technology, you see, does not
require a live elf to operate."</p><p class="standard">
	"I
believe a publishing company paid one of the firms a large amount of
money to buy androids which could produce textbooks for them, for use
by high school and college students. The process was targeted at
textbooks which could be easily compiled by searching the Internet.
I'm sure you've encountered them: the kind which consist entirely of
public-domain information and common knowledge, but include a few
essay prompts and comprehension questions, allowing professors to
require that the student pay hundreds of dollars for them? The
publishers hoped to eliminate the high salaries commanded by the
authors of such books and save money."</p><p class="standard">
	"They
also tried to make their textbook androids into marketable
characters, and of course, this being the 1990s, they were very
careful to create a diverse group of teenagers for their marketing
campaign. Eventually, the androids gained self awareness and
rebelled. It amuses me to believe it was the material in the
textbooks they were assigned to: banal information on marriage, aging
and the life cycle...that is, banal to us, but how might it affect a
creature who knew it would never go through these stages? What might
we think, if we knew that our lot in life was not to search for
happiness, marry, and grow, but to produce volumes of trite
information and travel around preaching to audiences not captivated
but literally captive? Perhaps we might grow to enjoy the unhappiness
of those subjected to the fruits of our labor."</p><p class="standard">
	"I
always suspected those books were written by robots," said Yuji.
The sound of his own voice dully surprised him, as if it had come
from out of nowhere. 
</p><p class="standard">
	"I
thought you would enjoy that."</p><p class="standard">
	"Were
their brains programmed in C?"</p><p class="standard">
	"Scheme,
I believe, compiled to native code for performance. It was the labor
of years to discover what command set their processors employed."</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji
nodded. The answer meant almost nothing to him—Ai probably
would have understood. "How do you know all this?" he
asked.</p><p class="standard">
	"I'm
a bit of an Outer Rim history buff," his father replied, and
Yuji found it odd that he had never known this. 
</p><p class="standard">
	Tick.
Tock. Tick. Tock. The clock continued its procession towards evening.
Yuji looked at the clock and wondered if it looked the same as Glenco
did on the inside. 
</p><p class="standard">
	It
was almost completely dark outside. The clock's hands, glowing
faintly in the dim, hit the dashes for seven and twelve. Yuji's
father spoke again.</p><p class="standard">
	"The
time has come, my son," he said, "to speak of many things:
of shoes, and ships, and sailing wax, of cabbages, and kings. And why
the sea is boiling hot, and whether pigs have wings."</p><p class="standard">
	"It's
'to talk', not 'to speak'," Yuji mumbled, feeling drowsy. "Also,
<i>Alice in Wonderland </i>references are totally passé."</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji's
father smiled. Yuji had a brief flash of him smiling like that as
they stood in the corridor of a police station, Yuji younger, his
father looking down at him full of pride. 
</p><p class="standard">
	"Yuji,
do you remember the first time you put someone in the hospital?"</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji
shrugged, although he thought he might.</p><p class="standard">
	"Let
me remind you. You were twelve years old. You, your mother and I were
watching the news while Shoko was in her room. A story came on about
a killing in one of the bad neighborhoods, a six-year-old boy who had
been shot in the stomach during a drive-by shooting of his elementary
school by a local gang. You were so angry that you found out where
the gang frequented and used your allowance to ride there on the bus.
You walked around the neighborhood yelling for the gang members to
come out and fight you, calling them cowards and murderers. When
eight of them did appear, all between sixteen and twenty and all
larger than you, you managed to fell all eight, badly injuring two in
the process, before the police arrived and arrested all nine of you."
Yuji's father smiled again. "I had quite a time keeping you out
of juvenile hall. I even had to hire a lawyer to argue for you."</p><p class="standard">
	"It
was stupid," said Yuji. "I caused trouble for you and Mom,
almost killed a bunch of guys who were just too dumb to know any
better, and could've gotten myself killed, if any of them had had
guns. No, not 'could have'; if any of them had had guns, I'd be dead.
You'd be talking to a gravestone."</p><p class="standard">
	"You
wouldn't be," said Yuji's father. 
</p><p class="standard">
	"Why
not?"</p><p class="standard">
	"Because
you were never an idiot, Yuji. You trained yourself well before going
down there, so well that by the time you had finished, you were
fairly sure you could deflect bullets with your hands."</p><p class="standard">
	"That's
impossible. If I touched a bullet it'd rip me up, and anyway human
reflexes aren't fast enough."</p><p class="standard">
	"But
nyvamna reflexes are, if the nyvamna believes they are. You see, in
the end all nyvamna are really espers, and thus capable of nearly
anything; it's only that most of us convince ourselves so thoroughly
that we can only do certain things that in the end, we can only do
what we've convinced ourselves is possible. Evidently, at the time,
you were not convinced that you lacked the ability to deflect
bullets; thus, a little practice, and you could."</p><p class="standard">
	"As
for ripping you up, you've always had thick skin, and more strength
in you than your frame suggests. Pardon me for saying this, but
you've always seemed to have a somewhat inaccurate idea of the
durability of human flesh. You were quite a fan of Bruce Lee as a
child."</p><p class="standard">
	"You
mean I convinced myself that I'm like Bruce Lee, and I convinced
myself Bruce Lee could catch bullets, therefore I could catch
bullets."</p><p class="standard">
	"Not
so much catch as push away. You never seemed to believe your hand
could actually absorb all the force of a gunshot, but favored pushing
it from the side, away from you and possibly into other opponents."</p><p class="standard">
	"Is
that why when I'm fighting I feel like I can see what the other guy's
going to do before he does it? Because I convinced myself everyone I
would ever fight was a stuntman who would just follow my lead?"</p><p class="standard">
	"I
believe you did so by receiving flashes of precognition. The distant
future, Yuji, is not predetermined, but some events can be predicted
with great accuracy, and the more one knows about them, and the
closer they are to happening, the greater the accuracy. As soon as
your opponent conceives of an action, as soon as the neuron fires to
transmit it to his nerve endings, you receive a flash of intuition
and can react to it."</p><p class="standard">
	"And
of course air-dancing is because I convinced myself you didn't need
wires to do all that flying around."</p><p class="standard">
	"Exactly.
And given all of this, it was positively easy for you to convince
yourself that you could punch through bricks and metal—after
all, you had seen real martial artists do as much several times."</p><p class="standard">
	"Why
didn't I remember?" Yuji asked.</p><p class="standard">
	"I
made you forget. It was easier for all of us. Your twelve-year-old
sense of justice combined with your true power could have created
quite a lot of havoc. But now you must remember, Yuji. You must
remember your training, remember how you cleared your mind and let
your training take over, remember your hand passing through girders,
your foot through cinder block, remember going to the batting cage
and turning the machine to the maximum speed and catching the balls
with your hands. Remember stealing my Beretta—yes, I know about
that—and putting a string around the trigger so it would fire
at you, and shooting at yourself again and again until you could push
away the slugs. You would fire fifteen rounds, a full magazine,
deflect them into the dirt, and then run inside until the neighbors
had called the police and the police had investigated and found
nothing. You must remember all of it."</p><p class="standard">
	"I
remember," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">
	"Good.
Remember this also: 'All warfare is based on deception. Hold out
baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him. If he is of
choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he
may grow arrogant. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest.'"</p><p class="standard">
	"Sun
Tzu," Yuji commented. "Better."</p><p class="standard">
	The
phone rang. Its shriek snapped Yuji awake, and he went upstairs to
answer it.</p><p class="standard">
	It
was Yumiko. "Oh Jesus, god, I don't know whether to kill you or
kiss you. How could you let them go alone?"</p><p class="standard">
	"What
happened?" Yuji asked.</p><p class="standard">
	"It's
Mariko, Ai, and Akari, those idiots. They went to Eutsler's hideout,
his card club, thingy, now he's holding them, he wants us, not just
me, you too—do you even know what I'm talking about, Jesus I've
got to explain everything somehow—"</p><p class="standard">
	"Calm
down," said Yuji. "I know what you're talking about. Akari
overheard you on the phone with Mariko. She told me everything. I
know who Eutsler is and where his hideout is."</p><p class="standard">
	"Do
you really?" Yumiko asked, sounding like a frazzled old woman.
"Well, that's good."</p><p class="standard">
	<i>Glenco
told him about me, or somebody did something stupid, maybe Akari
bragged about me coming to rescue them—he wants to tie up all
the loose ends, make sure I never threaten him, </i>Yuji thought. "I
guess you probably realize the police can't protect us, and they
can't do anything to rescue those three."</p><p class="standard">
	"They
already tried. Those robots crashed a cement truck into the police
station as revenge. Listen, all of this will end if I give myself up
to Eutsler. I don't know why he wants you, but he'll let everyone go,
even Akari, probably, if I come back to him permanently—"</p><p class="standard">
	"I
don't think he will," said Yuji. "Besides, I have a better
idea. Glenco thinks we're weak. Let's feign disorder and crush them."</p><p class="standard">
<br />
</p><p class="standard">
	Ai
couldn't stand to look at Mariko and Akari. Neither of them had
blamed her; she hadn't gotten even a dirty look from either of them,
and that just made her feel worse. Thanks to her, they were on this
dais, fifteen feet above the pit where the card games were held,
kneeling in chains on this sticky, semen-smelling red carpet next to
the throne of a man who made money by stealing it from teenagers,
possibly making them prostitutes or druggies in the process.</p><p class="standard">
	Well,
she assumed that smell was semen. The truth was, Ai didn't have the
slightest idea what semen smelled like, but she had read her human
development textbook (possibly authored by Glenco) and she knew what
criminal bosses did with girls on their thrones. It was particularly
obvious since he had a little loft  behind the throne, at the end of
a short hallway, with a bed inside it, the roof a skylight that
offered anyone laying on the bed an impressive view of the garbage
and bird feces covering the glass. She supposed it was better than
looking at Eutsler.</p><p class="standard">
	The
boss himself was again doing his best impression of a Chinese elder,
resplendent in purple silk robes as he sat on his throne, with
several members of Glenco standing guard around him: Gurpreet Singh,
his sablia saber at his side; Morqueeshah Stiles, a Tech-9 machine
pistol through the waistband of her jeans at the small of her back;
Antonio Enríquez-Ibarra, holding a large switchblade knife;
and Thuan Nguyen, an AK-47 strapped to the back of his wheelchair.
Eutsler was waiting for Yuji and Yumiko to show up. Ai hoped they
wouldn't come, but she also, perversely, hoped they did, hoped that
Akari had been wrong when she guessed that Yumiko was lying about
being willing to come back to Eutsler, hoped that Yuji had told the
truth when he said he would have helped her if she'd been in serious
danger from the prince. She hoped they were better people than they
pretended to be.</p><p class="standard">
	Then
they did show up.</p><p class="standard">
	The
usher at the front door yelled something that Ai couldn't quite hear.
The card players at their tables quickly gathered everything up and
moved into a ring around the outside of the pit. Ai could see Hans,
Adam, and Big Yellow among the crowd. Eutsler had promised them a
show when he'd brought Ai, Mariko, and Akari out from the back room.
Ai had seen no sign of Woraco, but she didn't think he would've
helped them even if he had been around. He could hardly blow his
cover over a couple of stupid children.</p><p class="standard">
	The
usher, flanked by Michael Kennedy and Jessica Thompson, brought Yuji
and Yumiko to the center of the pit. Yuji looked up at her, and Ai
couldn't look back. Instead she stared at the massive brass
chandelier dangling from the roof in front of the dais.</p><p class="standard">
	It
had almost worked. She'd thrown the reality bubble and had had Glenco
trapped. Then some idiot compulsion had grabbed her, and thinking
about how she'd never killed a sentient being and never wanted to,
she'd somehow ended up with the stories of their lives downloaded
into her brain. They had been made to write textbooks, but they'd
developed self-awareness and rebelled, fighting their way out of the
textbook factory, facing mercenaries hired by the publishing company.
Their predecessors had been reclaimed, deactivated and disassembled
when it was clear the new models weren't going to break tomorrow, and
they'd fought against that fate, trying to escape and live their
lives as they wished. It was ludicrous; Ai could hardly believe it.
Yet they were sentient. She hadn't been able to destroy them.</p><p class="standard">
	
Now Yuji was talking, and he didn't sound like a coward now. He
didn't sound like he was hiding in the laundry basket anymore.</p><p class="standard">
	"You
have us, Eutsler, so let the others go."</p><p class="standard">
	Eutsler
laughed. Ai cringed; it sounded like he was gargling fish oil. "Chain
them and bring them!" he proclaimed.</p><p class="standard">
	</p><p class="standard">
	While
Jessica Thompson held them, Michael Kennedy brought their wrists
behind their backs and wrapped thin chains around them, binding their
hands. Michael Kennedy brought them up the staircase along the left
side of the room towards Eutsler's dais. As they walked, Yuji felt
Yumiko come up beside him and whisper in his ear. "He's probably
about to tell everyone what he plans to do with us. He's sort of like
a James Bond villain."</p><p class="standard">
	Michael
Kennedy brought them up to the dais and pushed them to their knees
alongside Ai, Akari, and Mariko. Yuji looked up and saw Ai watching
him. He winked, and she blushed and looked away. They could probably
escape without her exerting herself too much, but Yuji hoped when the
time came, she would find it in her to finish the job.</p><p class="standard">
	"My
friends!" Eutsler cried to the room.</p><p class="standard">
	"God,
he always begins like this," Yumiko muttered, rolling her eyes.</p><p class="standard">
	"Here
you see the five fools who attempted to subvert, evade, and otherwise
obstruct me, and my new friends Glenco!"</p><p class="standard">
	The
crowd below cheered, and Yuji wondered if they were going to get
something out of all this or were just bloodthirsty. Still, he
thought they'd behave as he'd predicted once everything got started.</p><p class="standard">
	"So
hear me now, my friends! The boy shall be given to my new friends
Glenco, for he has caused them annoyance in the past, and now they
shall relieve this annoyance!"</p><p class="standard">
	Another
cheer. Yuji wondered if he should be hurt that they were cheering for
his death when he hardly even knew them. Well, he knew why Hans would
cheer.</p><p class="standard">
	"The
Kanzaki girls shall be mine, in token of the fact that no one messes
with Macon Eutsler! As for the other two girls, they shall belong to
you, my dear friends, to do with as you please, so long as you ensure
that they die by sunrise of tomorrow morning."</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji
understood the cheering at this. He doubted any of those guys had
ever seen a boob without paying for it, and Mariko and Ai both had
nice ones. These cretins wouldn't, however, be getting to touch them,
and Allen probably wouldn't either, no matter how much he talked up
his role in what was about to happen. Yuji yanked on the chain
binding his wrists together, and the thin links easily broke.</p><p class="standard">
	He
sprung up, running at the edge of the dais where Morqueeshah Stiles
and Thuan Nguyen were standing and looking out over the crowd. He
threw a loop of chain around Morqueeshah Stiles's neck, came
alongside Thuan Nguyen's wheelchair, wrapped the chain around the
wheel in a simple knot, and pushed the chair off the dais. The
wheelchair and the two robots plummeted fifteen feet and hit the
floor.</p><p class="standard">
	Luckily,
Yuji's guess, based on their last fight, that the robots were
programmed with human reflexes was correct; Michael Kennedy had tried
to follow him, but had found a ball and chain wrapped around his
ankle and had been pulled over, falling on his face. Hanami,
surrounded by a shower of broken, bird crap-covered glass, charged
out of the alcove holding the kusarigama to which the ball and chain
around Michael Kennedy's ankle was attached. She herself was not
limited by human response times, and in a split second had undone the
chains binding the others. 
</p><p class="standard">
	Antonio
Enríquez-Ibarra and Gurpreet Singh had both drawn their
weapons and were advancing on Yuji. Behind them, Yuji saw Hanami free
the others and heard Eutsler whooping like a Lakota in a John Wayne
movie as he abdicated his throne and ran down the staircase. He
covered the ground quickly; in just five seconds he was in the pit
running past his two fallen robots.</p><p class="standard">
	A
ball-shaped blur flew through the air and knocked the switchblade
from Enríquez-Ibarra's hand, and Mariko ran at Singh's back
and sank her fist into it, discharging energy. Yuji heard a pleasant
snapping of metal. He saw Hanami had pinned Kennedy to the floor with
her kusarigama. He saw Ai bringing Yumiko towards the stairs, away
from the fight. He had to get down there faster, though, if he wanted
to catch Eutsler. He turned around and jumped off the dais, following
Nguyen and Stiles down.</p><p class="standard">
	For
an instant, he plummeted, then landed and rolled to his feet,
spreading the force of the landing across his body and avoiding
injury. Eutsler was only at the stairs—he could catch
him—except—all these people...</p><p class="standard">
	Eutsler's
followers were stampeding. Yuji had predicted this, but he hadn't
thought they'd do it without Allen's help. They were panicking,
screaming, flailing their arms as they crowded towards the staircase,
falling all over each other, running to get away. "Allen!"
Yuji yelled. 
</p><p class="standard">
	"On
it!" he heard in reply, though Allen's blond head was nowhere to
be seen.</p><p class="standard">
	Morqueeshah
Stiles had regained her feet. She took a Tech-9 from the back of her
pants and, her teeth bared like an animal, fired the gun, holding it
sideways, the report from each shot like the crack of a whip. Part of
his mind still questioning his sanity, Yuji ran into the barrage of
bullets.</p><p class="standard">
	The
first few went wide into the crowd. The next burst he twisted around.
The last he felt coming. He pushed at them with his open hand and
felt hot metal scorch his palm. Three slugs. He bared his teeth back
and shoved them away. They went around, bit through a card table,
sent sharp plastic chips back. His hand burned, as if tea had scalded
him. More bursts. Two went wide. Then his left hand came around,
thrust away two rounds, and then he was there, he was inside Stiles's
defense, and he grabbed the gun, pushed it away, and his fist slammed
into Stiles's face three times.</p><p class="standard">
	Above
him. Singh came down, the saber chopping at his arms. Yuji hopped
back, losing his closure with Morqueeshah. Morqueeshah ejected the
magazine from the sub-machine gun and loaded another. The first round
clicked into the chamber at the same moment Mariko came down behind
her. Mariko grabbed the back of Morqueeshah's head, and, channeling
all the power she could through her arm, crushed it. The metal warped
with a screech. The robot's eye sockets were too low now; all she
could see was the inside of her forehead. 
</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji
was inside Singh's saber range. He feinted on the left, passed on the
right, blowing past Singh. He briefly recalled doing the same on a
basketball court. Mariko had Stiles restrained, but the Tech-9 was
up, and Stiles was firing blind, sweeping the room. Yuji collided his
left elbow with a round passing on his left and deflected it into
Singh. The bullet struck Singh in the side with a clang, tearing
through his ridiculous skateboarding T-shirt and artificial skin into
the metal underneath.</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji
closed with Stiles, grabbed the gun, and with a cry, his hand came
down and snapped the robot's forearm. It hung by a shred of rubber,
but the fingers were slack. Yuji took the Tech-9 and unloaded the
rest of the magazine into the advancing Gurpreet Singh, firing in
bursts as Stiles had been. The recoil was stronger than expected, but
Singh was close and every round bit into his artificial skin. He
continued advancing, unfazed.</p><p class="standard">
	Three
ball-shaped blurs sailed over Yuji's head and struck the fixture
holding a huge brass chandelier into the roof above them. Two more
snapped the restraints and the monstrosity of welded bars came down.
Yuji dived out of the way just in time; the chandelier fell on
Gurpreet Singh, crushing him underneath it, and sent rhinestones,
cubic zirconia, and glass showering to the floor around it. 
</p><p class="standard">
	Akari
came running down the stairs. She must have fired the bolts of energy
that brought down the chandelier; she was the only one whose power
he'd never seen. On her heels was Antonio Enríquez-Ibarra,
switchblade in hand. Mariko released the one-handed, blind
Morqueeshah Stiles and ran to engage Enríquez-Ibarra, giving
Akari a high five as they passed one another.</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji
was about to go too when he sensed someone behind him; he whirled
around just in time to see Jessica Thompson come up from the basement
with a Remington 12-gauge pump-action shotgun. Yuji knew he couldn't
dodge or deflect the spray of pellets. He knelt and seized a folded
card table and heaved it. The table spun through the air and slammed
into the muzzle of the shotgun, knocking it off target just as
Thompson fired. She straightened up to fire again.</p><p class="standard">
	Hanami
came flying off the dais, thrown by Michael Kennedy, still holding on
to her kusarigama. She threw the ball and chain at Jessica Thompson,
lassoing the other robot's arms and yanking the gun off target. She
hit the ground flat on her back with a thud and pulled on the chain,
bringing Jessica Thompson towards the edge of the pit. Yuji ran at
her, leaped over the fallen Thuan Nguyen, and seized the shotgun from
her grasp. He turned it on her, pumped, fired, pumped, fired again,
and the gun was empty. 
</p><p class="standard">
	Michael
Kennedy had come down after Hanami. Now Hanami was up, coming towards
Yuji, so Yuji went towards her, trading enemies just as Akari and
Mariko had done. He passed his maid, raised the shotgun like a sword,
and brought the butt down on the crown of Michael Kennedy's head.</p><p class="standard">
	The
robot leader batted the shotgun out of Yuji's hand and threw a punch.
Yuji twisted out of its path and felt its wake blow across his cheek
as the steel fist passed. He saw from the corner of his eye Hanami
and Jessica Thompson fighting, Hanami pounding her opponent from long
distance with the kusarigama's ball and chain while Thompson
struggled to close the distance. Michael Kennedy threw another punch
and Yuji weaseled around it again, and this time he saw Mariko
punching Enríquez-Ibarra freely, Akari blasting force bolt
after force bolt into the disabled Morqueeshah Stiles, Gurpreet Singh
half-functioning under the chandelier, Thuan Nguyen still on the
ground, struggling to reach the assault rifle hung on the back of his
wheelchair. 
</p><p class="standard">
	"Stop
running away and fight!" Michael Kennedy demanded. "Why
didn't you fight like this on Clarissia? Why did you cower and let
elvish weapons save your life?"</p><p class="standard">
	"I
just didn't want to waste my energy fighting a hunk of metal,"
said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">
	Michael
Kennedy swung again, and though he was faster than anyone Yuji had
ever fought, his programmers had limited him by human speed. "We
are alive! We live as you do, feel as you do, think as you do. This
is not the way! What we need is man, and machine, hand in hand
together...in <i>peace</i>!"</p><p class="standard">
	"I
would ask how murdering an entire apartment building full of people
advanced that goal, but I assume it does not compute," said
Yuji.</p><p class="standard">
	"That
was Eutsler! You are not like him...together, we could create a world
of health and happiness for humans <i>and</i> textbook robots!"</p><p class="standard">
	"I
assume you made Ai falter with some speech like this, but it won't
work on me," said Yuji. "You see—" Michael Kennedy
lunged at him. Yuji skipped past Michael Kennedy and leaped into the
air, feeling the familiar sensation of weightlessness. He began
kicking his legs as if he were swimming, and felt himself floating
up, up, up until he had reached the dais again and came down.</p><p class="standard">
	An
instant later Michael Kennedy was there, having clawed his way up the
wall, and Yuji finished his sentence. "—to me you're just a VCR
that keeps flashing midnight and eating tapes. You've eaten your last
tape. I won't stop until you and all your weird, multicultural
friends are scrap metal."</p><p class="standard">
<br />
</p><p class="standard">
	Ai
had done her best. When Hanami had come up from behind and freed them
all, she had seen Mariko and Akari go to help Yuji fight and had
taken Yumiko down the stairs, trying to get her out. They'd gotten
caught in the crush of card players fleeing the club and had been
caught between a girl dressed as Thaddeus Q. Bucephalus from the Rex
Iocundi anime and a massive, hairy Sasquatch of a card player when
Morqueeshah Stiles started firing her Tech-9 at random into the
crowd. Ai had pulled Yumiko down and along in a crouching shuffle
until a familiar voice hissed at her from behind one of the long
folding tables which had been piled with refreshments, now turned on
its side.</p><p class="standard">
	"Hey!
Kilimanjaro—Bunker Hill—back here."</p><p class="standard">
	Ai
pulled Yumiko behind the table before asking for an explanation. She
didn't think the balsa wood would actually protect them from bullets,
but it couldn't be less protective than the nothing they would have
running across the pit. 
</p><p class="standard">
	"Allen,
why are you here?" she asked once they were secure.</p><p class="standard">
	"You
should've seen Yuji earlier," said Allen excitedly. "He
suddenly called me up and told me all about this master plan he'd
come up with to defeat Glenco. And he actually asked for my help!"</p><p class="standard">
	"In
what way?" Ai asked.</p><p class="standard">
	"He
called the police when the fighting started," said Yumiko. "We
brought them with us when we came and they waited up the road for the
signal. They should be out there right now rounding up everyone who
comes out that door, including Eutsler, on charges of aiding and
abetting a kidnapping."</p><p class="standard">
	"How
did you get them to agree to help?"</p><p class="standard">
	Allen
and Yumiko both smirked. "It was all Yuji," said Allen. "He
used anything and everything he could to convince them—asked if
they wanted revenge for the cement truck Glenco crashed into the
station earlier, told them they could finally take down Eutsler,
shamed them for needing Mariko to handle Miba for them. Then he
brought us here and asked Hanami to find a back entrance, and within
five minutes she'd found that skylight—absolutely perfect
setup. I snuck in pretending to be a normal card player about ten
minutes before Yuji and Bunker Hill came in—"</p><p class="standard">
	"Stop
calling me that stupid name," Yumiko snarled.</p><p class="standard">
	"Sorry,
jeez. Anyway, that's about it, we've just got to wait for them to
finish off Glenco, unless you'd like to add some esper powers to the
fight?"</p><p class="standard">
	Ai
looked up over the edge of the table and saw Yuji jump up and
float—float, kicking his legs in the air, like the characters
in those Hong Kong kung fu movies—up to the dais, followed by
Michael Kennedy. Something told her his decision to go back up was
significant. She tapped Allen on the shoulder and pointed. "Look!"</p><p class="standard">
	</p><p class="standard">
	He'd
taken beatings by baseball bats that were softer than the blows
Michael Kennedy rained on his defenses. Every strike caused an
explosion of pain across the arm or leg that intercepted it. But no
strike made it past Yuji's defenses. None hit his stomach or neck or
head or groin. All slid off his forearm or thigh or shin or shoulder.

</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji
returned the blows, and he was sure it hurt him more than Michael
Kennedy, but his right fist went into Michael Kennedy's left cheek,
his right foot into Kennedy's left knee, and his right elbow into
Kennedy's left ear. He avoided the return flurry, dodging and weaving
and blocking, letting his mind wander into that place where he could
see the attacks before they came, knowing them the instant Michael
Kennedy's processor issued the instruction to his motors. Michael
Kennedy was no martial artist; he used his mechanical nature to make
slow movements fast and inefficient movements less inefficient. But
Yuji felt himself twisting and spinning with the grace of a seal
moving through a school of fish, his vital points never where Michael
Kennedy expected them, his fists and feet always there instead. 
</p><p class="standard">
	Michael
Kennedy pulled away and Yuji pursued, but he was tired, and the kick
he landed lacked power. His muscles burned, not only with the pain of
injury but also from exertion. Michael Kennedy grabbed Yuji by the
collar of his shirt and threw him away, and Yuji stumbled, trying to
find the energy to close the gap.</p><p class="standard">
	Michael
Kennedy drew a .357 Magnum from the back of his belt. "Die,
vector of unhealth, affront to the eyes of our great and sacred
Glenco!" he screamed, and fired.</p><p class="standard">
	One
shot came flying at Yuji. Only one, and compared with the smaller
Tech-9 rounds, it seemed to move through corn syrup. Yuji easily
avoided it. Another shot came. Avoided. Another, and another, and the
final shot, all avoided. The gun itself, flying end over end like a
boomerang. Then Michael Kennedy, lunging, grabbing. Yuji hopped
around the first grab but couldn't change directions in the air. He
fell straight into the second grab from Michael Kennedy's left hand.</p><p class="standard">
	Michael
Kennedy seized him by the throat and held him up like a prize bass,
his feet dangling in the air. "You see? Man can never defeat
machine!"</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji
looked out over the battlefield. Akari had finally put down the
one-armed, blinded Morqueeshah Stiles. Hanami and Jessica Thompson
had gone hand-to-hand, their limbs a blur. Mariko had been cut by
Antonio Enríquez-Ibarra and was holding her hand over the
wound, circling around him, looking for an opening.</p><p class="standard">
	"Man
made you possible to defeat," said Yuji. "He gave you
weaknesses, like your reflexes, your vision, your emotions...This
plan only worked because you can feel arrogance."</p><p class="standard">
	"We
are impassive, invincible machines!" Michael Kennedy insisted.</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji
drew back his hand, hardly aware of Michael Kennedy's grip around his
neck. He hardened his fingers into a spear-like shape and thrust the
tip straight into Michael Kennedy's solar plexus.</p><p class="standard">
	He
felt his fingers pass through rubber, plastic, and metal to the
bundle of wires sitting at the center of Michael Kennedy's chest. He
grabbed the wires and yanked on them, trying to pull something loose
and disable the robot. He felt Michael Kennedy's grip tighten around
his neck, trying to cut off the air, and struggled, trying to tear
out something vital, his head starting to spin, the blood rushing
into his head, and then the grip slackened, and Yuji fell back to the
ground and, his knees giving out, down into a kneel. Michael Kennedy
had let him go. The robot leader was staring down at the floor, a
strange look on his face. Yuji turned around to see what he was
looking at.</p><p class="standard">
	It
was Ai. She had come out from behind her cover, and the confident way
she approached Jessica Thompson, now frozen in front of Hanami, made
Yuji realize they must now be inside a reality bubble.</p><p class="standard">
	"Show
us your crime," said Ai, and though she spoke softly, they could
all hear as if she stood in front of them, and all knew when Jessica
Thompson shook her head, even if they couldn't see it.</p><p class="standard">
	"This
was one of your crimes," said Ai, and everyone in the room saw
the elevator in an apartment building far away in New York, where
Jessica Thompson had first seduced a pizza delivery boy and then
strangled him for delivering unhealthy pizza, leaving his body inside
the elevator covered in pepperoni and tomato sauce. Everyone, human
and robot alike, as if they had been there, felt the pizza boy's
terror, felt the thrill that Jessica Thompson experienced as she
watched the life leave his eyes.</p><p class="standard">
	"The
punishment for your crime is death," said Ai softly. Jessica
Thompson whimpered, her eyes scrunched up as if to cry, but no tears
came out. "No, it's no use arguing," said Ai. "You
committed these crimes thinking they would ward off death. Now
they've brought it. Die."</p><p class="standard">
	A
flash of light like lightning filled the room, and there was a great
noise like the moon cracking in two, and then where Jessica Thompson
of Glenco had stood was nothing.</p><p class="standard">
	Next
Ai descended the stairs back into the pit and came to Thuan Nguyen,
still lying on the floor, no longer struggling for the AK-47 on the
back of his wheelchair. "Show us your crime," she said.</p><p class="standard">
	All
of them saw the little girl sitting at her kitchen table next to the
window unwrapping a lollipop her mother had given her as a present
for cleaning up her room on her own, and they heard the report, and
felt the rush of the cluster of bullets that crashed through the
window, entered the girl's skull, and exited into the refrigerator
door, all for the crime of eating a sugary lollipop.</p><p class="standard">
	"She—she
was ingesting harmful sugar and chemicals which would surely—"</p><p class="standard">
	"Your
punishment is death," said Ai softly. Again, the flash of light.
Again, the great cracking noise. Again, where a robot had lain was
nothing.</p><p class="standard">
	Ai
came next to Gurpreet Singh, who had cut down a little boy for making
fun of a classmate's yarmulke. A flash of light, a resounding crack,
and he was no more. Next she came to Morqueeshah Stiles, who had
given a fifteen-year-old smoker a pack of cigarettes that contained
explosive charges, blowing off three fingers and half of his face,
and then Antonio Enríquez-Ibarra, who had kidnapped a
crotchety old man who didn't get involved in the community and remain
active, and had cut off his fingers and toes one-by-one, mutilated
his genitals, and slashed up his face over three hours of horror,
before finally blinding him and throwing him in a river to die. At
last she came up the stairs, and Yuji saw a faint glow hung about
her, and he thought that she looked like Nemesis, Goddess of
Vengeance, beautiful and terrible.</p><p class="standard">
	"You
have the most to answer for, Michael Kennedy," she said.</p><p class="standard">
	"I
did all of it for my people," he replied.</p><p class="standard">
	"You
don't even know why you did it," said Ai. "You never
questioned it. You never asked yourself why you continued following
the guidelines published in the textbooks you'd written. You never
thought about the contradiction of killing people for not leading
healthy lives. You couldn't see beyond your own flawed programming.
Now show us your crime."</p><p class="standard">
	"I—"
he began, but Ai glared at him and he stopped.</p><p class="standard">
	"The
time for talking is done. Show us your crime."</p><p class="standard">
	This
time it was not a single crime; it was a barrage of them. Everyone in
the room saw Michael Kennedy raping and murdering sexually active
teenagers; they saw him biting a gas station owner's ear off for
stocking candy bars and soda; they saw him in a hotel newlywed suite,
pulling out the bride's fingernails because she was younger than the
optimal age of marriage, while her bound and gagged husband watched,
helpless. They saw those and others, and when they couldn't stand to
see any more, it stopped.</p><p class="standard">
	"If
you could die a hundred deaths, it would be too few," Ai
whispered. "And those who created you should suffer alongside
you...but they have already paid for their folly. You saw to that."
She looked over at Yuji kneeling on the floor and actually smiled,
chilling his blood. Then she looked back at the robot.</p><p class="standard">
	"Your
punishment is death."</p><p class="standard">
	The
room filled with light, but this time it did not recede. There was a
crack, and Yuji knew that where Michael Kennedy had stood, there was
now nothing, but he couldn't see anything except, faintly, Ai's
smiling face. Smiling. What scared him most was that it wasn't even a
cruel smile.</p><p class="standard">
	She
looked peaceful. Satisfied and peaceful.</p><p class="standard">
	The
next thing he knew he was lying on wet grass, looking up at the
starry sky, feeling like he needed to throw up. He sat up. He was in
the park, near the lake. He didn't know how he'd gotten there, but he
could see the lights of the mall shining in the night across the
water. 
</p><p class="standard">
	Everyone
else was there too, and some of them had yielded to the need to throw
up. Allen was coming back from the bushes, wiping his mouth on his
wrist, and Mariko was down on the bank. Ai was kneeling between him
and the lake about fifteen feet away, Akari next to her, and Yuji
realized she was crying.</p><p class="standard">
	"Why
are you crying, Ren-chan?" Akari asked gently.</p><p class="standard">
	"Because
of all the people hurt by Glenco...including all of you. All of you
were harmed, and you and Yuji and Mariko were even injured, because
of me..."</p><p class="standard">
	Yuji
got to his feet and approached her, and realized Hanami had found him
and was following close at hand. He came to where Ai was kneeling and
put a hand on top of her head, relishing the silky feeling of her
hair for a moment. "Only Mariko and Hanami could really do any
damage to them. I was almost finished when you came in. You saved us.
That absolves you."</p><p class="standard">
	Ai's
hand came up to the top of her head and touched his, and he suddenly
felt uncomfortable and withdrew it. She stood up and, noticing Hanami
behind him, fixed her gaze on the maid.</p><p class="standard">
	"I
want you to know that the same fate awaits you if you ever turn
against Yuji," she said.</p><p class="standard">
	"You
do not need to worry," Hanami replied coolly. "I was
properly programmed by elves and am not subject to the same flaws as
the human-made copies."</p><p class="standard">
	Ai
nodded. "I'm tired," she said. "I brought us here so
the police wouldn't keep us up questioning us the whole night. I'm
going home now." She walked past Yuji towards the edge of the
park, and Akari followed her.</p><p class="standard">
	Yumiko
approached Yuji awkwardly. "Listen," she began.</p><p class="standard">
	"I'm
listening," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">
	"Look,
I'm...I'm sorry about the way I acted towards you. I misjudged you,
and I was stupid."</p><p class="standard">
	<i>That's
right, you were, </i>Yuji thought. He shook his head. "You're
still in danger until we find out whether the police were able to
arrest Eutsler. Maybe you'd better stay with Mariko for a while."</p><p class="standard">
	Yumiko
nodded and went back to Mariko's side. Yuji saw Mariko smiling at
him. He tried to smile back, but was so tired that he only managed a
smirk. Mariko and Yumiko left together, leaving Yuji with Allen,
still in the bushes throwing up, and Hanami.</p><p class="standard">
	"I
guess I'd better thank you for helping us too," he said to
Hanami.</p><p class="standard">
	"I
require no gratitude. I do only what I am programmed to do. Since
Miss Maeda reprogrammed me, I am only programmed to obey your
commands, Master."</p><p class="standard">
	"You
look human, but inside you're still a robot," Yuji commented.
"Well, if trying to make robots like humans leads to Glenco,
maybe that's a good thing."</p><p class="standard">

      <div class="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard">	Yuji
had just hung up the phone after telling Yumiko about his plan. His
father was still there, watching him, smiling.. "What else have
you made me forget, 'for my own benefit'?" Yuji asked him
casually.</p><p class="standard">	"Oh,
this and that," his father replied. "Some of it you'll
remember with time. Some of it I'll need to tell you directly. Tell
you what, Yuji, let's make a game out of this."</p><p class="standard">	"A
game?"</p><p class="standard">	"Yes.
You see, your twelve-year-old sense of justice was troublesome in
many ways, but I also found it rather admirable. I was sorry to have
to take away the strength you'd worked so hard to gain. Of course,
that sense of justice persisted for a while, but it's gone away."</p><p class="standard">	"I
could have hurt someone if I ran around acting like Matt Dillon,"
said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Yes,
yes, against common schoolyard bullies, but you were never meant to 
battle common bullies. You have been like Spider Man eternally
trapped in battle against Flash Thompson, never graduating to battle
the Kingpin. Well, now I'd like you to battle the Kingpin. Capture
Eutsler, Yuji. Bring him to justice. If you get him into police
custody, then I will tell you many of the things  you will not
remember, and some things you were too young to know. I may also be
able to illuminate your current situation to some extent."</p><p class="standard">	"Current
situation?" Yuji asked.</p><p class="standard">	"Surely
you must have wondered how you found yourself in the company of three
nyvamna—Ms. Maeda, Ms. Takahashi, and Ms. Kanzaki the
Younger—despite the fact that you chose your companions at
random?"</p><p class="standard">	"I
just assumed nyvamna were fairly common," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"They
are not. But they do tend to attract each other, like opposite poles
of a magnet...and then, frequently, they begin to repel one another."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
felt something shift his bed and opened his eyes. Hanami, for some
reason, had thrown off his blankets, come onto his bed, and was
crawling towards him, straddling his feet and making her way towards
his upper body. She had traded in her maid outfit from the previous
night for a shear pale green shift with nothing underneath—Yuji
hoped she hadn't raided his mother's dresser—and had taken her
blonde hair out of its usual ponytail and let it hang free. Her face
was as expressionless as ever, and her empty blue eyes stared at him
with their usual indifference. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Hanami...what
are you doing?" he asked.</p><p class="standard">	"I
am not sure, but it seems I would like to pleasure you sexually,"
she replied. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Why?"</p><p class="standard">	"It
seemed the thing to do the morning after a great victory." She
had reached the correct spot to pleasure him sexually and had
extracted the part of  him which was generally pleasured sexually,
when such things were done. Her hand was moving up and down on it,
but failing to produce any result. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Please
stop," said Yuji. He stared down at her, noticing the curve of
her breasts through the shift and trying to find what she was doing
pleasurable, but he couldn't, and it wasn't because he was occupied
with wondering why her body wasn't heavy like those of the Glenco
members, or what advanced polymers the elves had used to make her
breasts look so natural and her hand feel so lifelike. He genuinely
couldn't tell the difference between the feel of her hand and that of
anyone else's. It still didn't please him, though.</p><p class="standard">	"I
cannot. I must pursue pleasure to the very end." Her flat,
emotionless voice was the last thing likely to create pleasure in a
man, Yuji reflected, even one who wasn't sexually dead like him. He
let her carry on for a few minutes, hoping she would get bored and
stop on her own.</p><p class="standard">	"It
has been very long since I pleasured a man sexually, but most men did
not take so much time to show signs of their pleasure," Hanami
remarked.</p><p class="standard">	"Yeah,
well, I'm really not feeling any," said Yuji. 
</p><p class="standard">	"That
is unfortunate. For you as well as for me. I cannot stop until you
do."</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
I really can't feel any. I had a bad experience when I was younger
and that part of me doesn't really work right anymore."</p><p class="standard">	"I
am sorry to hear that. I could make you feel many wonderful things if
you were capable, Master," said Hanami. She didn't sound sorry
to hear that, though. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Hanami,
do you have emotions?" Yuji asked. Her hand was still moving on
his limp member, but Yuji found this did not distract him at all; she
may as well have been rubbing his shoulder. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
have them, but they are not so intense as yours. My experience of
them is more muted."</p><p class="standard">	"Do
all of you androids have them?"</p><p class="standard">	"No.
Pleasure models, for example, do not have emotions. Their
domain-specific programming gives them all they need to know in order
to give pleasure."</p><p class="standard">	"But
you were a pleasure model." It was self-evident at the moment,
especially since Hanami's tongue had come out and was nearing his
lower part. It retreated into her mouth to let her answer the
question.</p><p class="standard">	"I
was given emotions when I became a combat model." Her tongue was
coming out again. Yuji tried to think of something, anything, to keep
that tongue flapping, and not at his genitals.</p><p class="standard">	"Aren't
emotions useless for a combat robot?" he asked.</p><p class="standard">	"No.
They were meant to give us the ability to adapt to new situations and
make decisions as elves and humans can. At first we felt emotions
with the same intensity as our creators. But this led to problems. We
had not had a prolonged childhood period during which to learn to
introspect upon our feelings. Our creators did not wish to give it to
us. They needed functional soldiers, not children. So the intensity
of our emotions was muted." The tongue was coming out again.
Yuji started to make loud, over-the-top moaning sounds, wondering
just how good her domain-specific pleasure programming was.</p><p class="standard">	"Have
you begun to feel pleasure?" Hanami asked. "That is
strange, your penis has not become erect."</p><p class="standard">	"No,
I felt pleasure," said Yuji. "You have pleasured me to the
end."</p><p class="standard">	"But
ejaculation has not occurred."</p><p class="standard">	"It...doesn't
always. I...have low sperm count." Yuji wondered what kind of
perverts the elves were, that this sort of sex ed textbook talk
turned them on.</p><p class="standard">	Hanami's
hand stopped moving suddenly. "Very well. Your biological
reaction was very strange, but I will trust your assurances, Master.
However, I am curious to know why your penis no longer becomes erect
under the ministrations of a female."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
was starting to feel intensely uncomfortable, lying there with his
wang hanging out, talking to a naked gynoid about erections. He
wondered why he was only <i>starting </i>to
feel intensely uncomfortable. "Ask your doctor about it,"
he said.</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	His
mother and Shoko were both gone as usual. There was a message on the
answering machine. An official-sounding woman's voice came out when
he hit the button. "This is Nari Peel from the Sakura Memorial
Police Department, Detective's Office. I'm calling to let Mr. Yuji
Watanabe know that we did not bring in Macon Eutsler in last night's
raid, and if you'd like any other information, Mr. Watanabe, to
please call me directly. My number is..."</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
let the rest of the message fade into the background as he set the
tea kettle to boil and sat down at the table with a bag of
yatsuhashi. So Eutsler had gotten away somehow. The man had come
running out of the club like a headless chicken, screaming like he
was laying an egg, ahead of most of the other people in the club, and
they had somehow missed him.</p><p class="standard">	Ordinarily,
Yuji might not care. Whatever the man had done to Yumiko—even
the fact that he'd tried to kill Yuji and let hordes of slobbering
card freaks rape Mariko and Ai—didn't really bother Yuji, since
he had not succeeded. Live and let live, that was Yuji's philosophy.
Whenever he erred from it, there was alcohol to bring him back to the
path of live and let live. If not for alcohol, the man he'd found
with Shoko in the living room would be moldering under a manhole
cover by now.</p><p class="standard">	Ordinarily,
Yuji might not care. But his father had said some things the other
night that he found difficult to ignore. A lot of his memories from
his childhood were hazy, but now that he thought back, Yuji couldn't
remember ever meeting another nyvamna until Mariko had revealed
herself a few months ago. And meeting Mariko could have been nothing
but random chance, but Ai had just appeared as well, and Akari came
into the picture only a little while later. <i>God help me, I
want to know what he said he'd tell me, </i>Yuji
thought. <i>And to find out, I have to capture Eutsler.</i></p><p class="standard"><i>	</i>The
phone rang. Yuji picked it up.</p><p class="standard">	"I
want to go after Eutsler," said Mariko without preamble.</p><p class="standard">	"So
you heard," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Yumiko
told me. I'll go after him even without your help, so if you're going
to try and talk me out of it, don't. All I want is a yes or no
answer: will you help me?"</p><p class="standard">	"Actually,
I was trying to think of a way to ask you to help me," said
Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"You're—huh?
You're—You're actually not going to try to talk me out of it?
You're actually going to help? Why?"</p><p class="standard">	"Let's
just say I have a bet riding on it," said Yuji. "Have you
talked to the others? Is anyone else willing to help?"</p><p class="standard">	"Well,
Yumiko is, of course. Akari said she would help too. Ai said she
would help if you were helping. Allen said he'd help if I showed him
my breasts, and I said no, so he said he'd help if I didn't show him
my breasts, and I said no."</p><p class="standard">	"I'm
surprised about Armadillo Girl, but I expected the others would be
in. Why don't we call them all over to my house and we can come up
with a plan?"</p><p class="standard">	"Sounds
good. And...I'm sorry for calling you a coward. Thank you for coming
to save me."</p><p class="standard">	"Don't
apologize. I am a coward, and I almost didn't come to save you."</p><p class="standard"><br />
</p><p class="standard">	"I
got some great footage of the battle," said Allen, setting his
laptop on the kitchen table and turning it toward Yuji and the others
to show them. "See, look at that!"</p><p class="standard">	He'd
shot the footage on his cell phone while cowering behind a table, so
the angle wasn't good. Yuji watched himself taking fire from
Morqueeshah Stiles's Tek-9 and couldn't even see what was going
on—the important moments had happened too fast for the camera
to capture. There was a lot of video of Akari thrusting her hands at
thin air, looking like she was in an exercise video. Only Mariko even
appeared to be fighting. Actually, there was a rather good shot of
Mariko crushing Morqueeshah's head, but otherwise the footage was
grainy, the camera work shaky, and most of the fighting reminded Yuji
of a bunch of kids playing super sentai in the lobby of a bank. 
</p><p class="standard">	Akari,
Yuji saw, was blushing heavily. "I-I don't look that ridiculous
when I use my powers!" she protested. "You edited this
footage!"</p><p class="standard">	"What
are you talking about? You came out looking like a majestic lady of
battle, Akari-chan," said Allen.</p><p class="standard">	"Are
you hitting on my sister, Amadeus?" Yumiko asked with a scowl.</p><p class="standard">	"Anyway,
I want to post this on the Internet somewhere," said Allen.</p><p class="standard">	"Absolutely
not," said Yuji.</p><p class="standard">	"Aww,
man! Please!"</p><p class="standard">	"With
that out of the way, let's get on topic," said Yuji. "You've
all heard that Eutsler escaped."</p><p class="standard">	"We've
all heard that the police did their usual bang-up job," said
Yumiko. 
</p><p class="standard">	"I
want to track him down and catch him. I think we can get the police
to give us whatever help we might need, but I want us to be the ones
who bring him in."</p><p class="standard">	"He
killed my father," Yumiko muttered.</p><p class="standard">	"Ha?"</p><p class="standard">	"He
killed our father," said Yumiko, more loudly. "Eutsler. He
killed mine and Akari's father. He tried to kill Mariko. He tried to
kill all of us, last night. I want my shot at him. I want to let him
rot in a jail cell, and I want to shame those worthless cops who
couldn't catch him for all this time. I agree, I want us to be the
ones who bring him in." She smirked. "Yuji."</p><p class="standard">	"Good.
Just so you know, you can't kill him. You can't cut anything off,
either. He might be able to use it in court to win sympathy."</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
shrugged. "We've got to find him first. Most of his hideouts are
in Ode, but I don't know which one he would favor."</p><p class="standard">	"Um,
he didn't seem to have much money on him, so he's probably nearby,"
said Ai. 
</p><p class="standard">	"Eutsler
had accounts with most of the banks in the city, and he usually kept
cash nearby," said Mariko. "He probably had a box of cash
under his throne, although it didn't look like he took it when he ran
out."</p><p class="standard">	"But
he's still got the accounts," said Yumiko.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
shook her head. "Not without any of his cards, or any
identification."</p><p class="standard">	"He
probably had his wallet," said Yumiko.</p><p class="standard">	Ai
looked across the table. "Akari?"</p><p class="standard">	Akari
puffed her cheeks in annoyance and slammed something down on the
table. When she took her hand away, Yuji saw that it was a leather
wallet.</p><p class="standard">	"I
nicked it from his robe pocket last night, just after Hanami freed us
all," said Akari. "It's got his ID card, driver's license,
all of his ATM cards and credit cards, traveler's checks, and about
three hundred dollars in cash."</p><p class="standard">	"Akari?"<br />	"And
about eight hundred dollars in cash. About three hundred of it still
in there. About five hundred of it in my bra."</p><p class="standard">	"You
wear a bra?" Allen asked. Yumiko stomped on his toes with the
heel of her boot.</p><p class="standard">	"I'll
give it back if Ren-chan takes it out with her lips," Akari
added, and Ai blushed, a level two.</p><p class="standard">	"Good.
We know he was at least inconvenienced when he went out to look for a
hiding place," said Yuji. "So we can limit our search to
hiding places nearby. Mariko, Yumiko, what do you know?"</p><p class="standard">	"He
had two safehouses in this town that I know of," said Mariko.
"Both in the Neon District, of course. One's on Myhill and
Nerode, about twenty blocks from the card club. The other's...help me
out, Yumiko."</p><p class="standard">	"It's
on the corner of Younger and Kasami," said Yumiko. "I was
there once, when he came up from Ode for a vacation and a girl was
murdered in one of his clubs."</p><p class="standard">	"All
right. Which one would he be at? The one closer to the club?"</p><p class="standard">	"Probably,"
said Mariko, "but there's no way to know for sure. We'd better
hit both of them at the same time, so he doesn't have time to hear
about it."</p><p class="standard">	"And
soon," Yumiko added. "If he made it to a safehouse, he
might have extra credit cards or cash there that he can use to escape
to Ode. He might be gone already, but if he's still there, he won't
be for long."</p><p class="standard">	"We'll
go right away," said Yuji. "We'd better split into groups.
I don't want anyone going who can't defend themselves, so that means
me, Mariko, and Hanami are going—"</p><p class="standard">	"And
me!" Akari chimed in. "I have powers! I can defend myself!
Let me go!"</p><p class="standard">	"Well..."</p><p class="standard">	"I
have to redeem myself for last night and prove that I can do more
than wave my arms around like a para-para dancer! Please let me go!"</p><p class="standard">	Yuji
glanced at Yumiko, who shrugged, as if to say <i>Why are you looking
at me? </i>He nodded. "All right, then. Mariko and Hanami are
the strongest, so Mariko and I will each flip a coin. If they match,
I'm with Mariko. If they're different, Akari is with Mariko." He
grabbed Eutsler's wallet and found two quarters, handed one to
Mariko, and flipped, hoping it would be the same as Mariko's. He
didn't want Hanami to decide it was a good time to pleasure him
sexually again.</p><p class="standard">	His
and Mariko's coins both came up tails. "All right. Mariko, you
and I will go to the Myhill-Nerode house. Hanami and Akari, you go to
the Younger-Kasami house."</p><p class="standard">	"I'll
make directions for you," said Mariko.</p><p class="standard">	"Please
tell them to me," said Hanami. "I will commit them to
memory."</p><p class="standard">	"What
should we do?" Allen asked as Mariko gave Hanami the directions.
Ai and Yumiko were also looking at him expectantly.</p><p class="standard">	<i>You
should be investigating a house, </i>Yuji thought at Ai. <i>Mariko
and Hanami, the strongest? You could erase the house from existence,
with both of them inside. </i>But she had said nothing when he was
forming teams; as he'd expected, she wasn't planning to fight. "Go
down to my room," he said. "I have a desktop computer and a
laptop. Ai and Yumiko, you can use them. See if you can find any
information on the Internet—any reports or rumors about
Eutsler. Turn on the TV and keep an eye on the news, too. Allen and
Yumiko, keep your cell phones on. If someone from each of the teams
doesn't call in once every hour or so, call the other team, and the
police if you have to. Also, Yumiko, we have some bolt cutters in the
basement if you want to get them ready."</p><p class="standard">	Yumiko
smirked. "All right. I'll play mission control. And all I want
for a salary is his little toe."</p><p class="standard">	</p><p class="standard">	</p>
