* Book 3 Plot Ideas
  
Book 3, I would like to have three or four shortish stories. Like The
Boredom of Haruhi Suzumiya. Here's my ideas for them:
(Note: the second story is getting huge. I might have to spin it off into a separate book. Or I guess just have a really long book.)

** Lady of the Morning

James investigates an older man who, the neighborhood gossip says,
has been sleeping with a much younger woman, despite the fact that
he's married.

James spies on them one morning and sees that the rumors are true and
that the woman is drop-dead gorgeous. (A Latina beauty). She goes into the house and gets to work servicing the old man with her hands and mouth, surprising James with the vitality of the old man's response.  He follows
her and uses his laser listening device (whatever those things are
called) to hear her ask to go to Sacramento as she gets into a cab.
James surmises that she has money and lives far away, so he can't
figure out why she's with the old manâ€”it's not money, and it's not convenience.

James looks her up on the Internet and finds out that she's a
masseuse named Sayona Suarez (after La Sayona, a Venezuelan mythological creature). She seems squeaky clean for the most part, but he stumbles on a shady forum where women are discussing a masseuse in Sacramento named La Sayona who helped them get rid of their cheating husbands. (He finds it by searching for masseuses in Sacramento who double as prostitutes for extramarital affairs.) James formulates the theory that she's a succubus who hires herself out to wounded wives to kill their cheating husbands.

James runs this theory by Sophia, who agrees that it sounds plausible and asks what he's planning to do about it. She adds that she's sorry, but what Sayona's doing isn't against the rules, so she can't help. James says he's just going to leave it alone since it would be in bad taste to report it, but Sophia doesn't believe him.

She's right not to believe him, of course. James spies on them again, taking video this time (which is sent back to his computer), and confronts Sayona as she leaves the house. Sayona tries to seduce him and kill him, but it doesn't work (since he's immune to succubus pheromones). James says he knows she's a succubus and asks if she'll talk to him. His real goal is that, although Sophia promised to tell him a few things about herself and make sure to give him vital information in the last book, he still wants to know the things she won't tell him about the succubus world, and he hopes Sayona will tell him. Sayona says she was hired by the old man's wife to show him a good time, then kill him, she doesn't know why. She assumes the old man was cheating, since most of her clients are wives who were cheated on by their husbands and want revenge, or want rid of an ex-husband.

James lets Sayona go since he can't fight her (even though she's not as powerful as Sophia since she's only been a succubus for a mere ninety years, but he doesn't know that) and goes and confronts the wife. The wife says she wasn't trying to murder her husband and he wasn't cheating on her. Since she has no one to confide in, she talks to James and tells him that she loves her husband, but the man is dying. He won't go to the doctor, so they don't know what he's dying from (he says he doesn't want to know), but he's dying of something. He said he wanted to feel young again and then have a painless death, so the wife found Sayona on the Internet and asked if she would give him a few days (weeks, months) of pleasure, and then the release of death. She agreed to do it, and soon she's going to finish him off.

James finishes the story by telling Sophia that he agreed not to tell anyone about the whole thing and Sayona offed the old man, with no one the wiser. Sophia says she's happy to hear that a succubus's power was able to go to good use.

[Alternately: Sophia as the lady of the morning? She could just be asked to hang out with him, and not actually have sex or kill him, but in the end he talks about wanting to have sex one more time before he goes and Sophia decides to give both things to him. James spies on her and finds out from her what's going on.]

** Sister Therapy [title check]

The other four stories in this volume are part of a framed tale where James and Sophia are sitting around at James's house celebrating James actually passing all his classes and surviving a yet-unrevealed traumatic event. (Which will be chronicled in the fourth book, and may involve succubus-hating vengeful housewives. La Sayona may also be involved, to justify including the Lady of the Morning story. After drinking rather a lot of wine, Sophia asks James to entertain her by telling her a story from before they met. James asks why he has to entertain her, since she probably has much more entertaining stories, and Sophia says since he's always wanting to know more about her, and she wants to know more about him, they'll do a trade: for each story he tells, she'll tell one.

Sophia specifically asks to know more about his relationship with Lucy, who she says seems like a cute, normal girl who shouldn't be bothered by creepy romantic pursuit by her brother. James confides that she's very cute, almost irresitibly cute, but that he's privileged to be basically the only boy in the world hwo knows that, because she doesn't really have friends and she's never dated. He says they've kissed before and they used to date. Sophia asks how such a creepy relationship ever started, and James tells her the following story.

About how James and Lucy "dated" for a while like in the last few episodes of Ore Imo (I actually thought of the idea in this context way early in Episode 14, when Kyousuke was dumping poor Kuroneko.) It was Lucy's idea since she had a crush on him when she was 12, 13, and 14 and he was 16, 17, 18. He agreed just to do it for a little while to make her feel good, but he's not really into it and thinks it's kind of creepy how she doesn't seem to have any friends and spends all her time on dates with her brother. 

He went through the assault investigation he talks about in Book II Chapter 8. James investigates and sees that the police aren't going to do anything, so he sets out to work on the case himself. He ends up with the tooth since he picked it out of the dumpster. He asks around the neighborhood and finds that everyone in the area suspects Clarence Reed, a toothless, unemployed redneck who had untreated mental issues in the past. He pesters Clarence, assaulting him day and night and trying to make him confess, until Clarence turns himself in to the police. 

James brags to Lucy on a "date" about how he made the criminal turn himself in, but Lucy doesn't think it sounds right. She asks why Clarence would turn himself in when the only actual evidence against him is neighborhood rumor; the police never even talked to him, so he could have just slipped town if he thought they were going to come for him. The story made front page news, so there's a big picture of Clarence in an open-mouthed scream on the front of the newspaper. Lucy asks to see the tooth and compares it to the picture. She notices that it's a left front incisor, which makes sense since the victim was kicking with her right foot, hitting her attacker's left. But Clarence still has his right-front incisor. 

James is distraught that he missed that at first, but he comments that Lucy is pretty smart and maybe she should be the one investigating. Lucy denies that she's very smart and says she shouldn't have interfered, but James says he's glad she did because he now knows that he screwed up and Clarence was innocent. He stares at the tooth, wondering if there's any way he can find out who it belonged to, and Lucy suggests that he might talk to some local dentists to see if they can identify it. James kisses her on the forehead and says he loves her, much to her pleasure.

James visits some dentists, but all of them refuse to break doctor-patient confidentiality. At the last one he visits, James loses his mind and starts raving that the dentist is protecting a serial killer and it's for the good of humanity. The dentist throws him out. However, the next day, he wakes up to find a dental record printout in an envelope in the mailbox, saying that someone called Mike Barinski just recently went to a dentist's office to have a plug put in for a front left incisor. 

James finds out that Mike Barinski likes to hang out in a certain biker bar. No one will tell him who Barinski is, so James challenges some bikers to a game of pool, but he doesn't actually know how to play pool, so he loses. In return for all the money he had and his shoes, which James also bet since they were pretty nice Converses, the biker tells James where Barinski lives. It's right down the street, so James walks down there barefoot and knocks on the door of Barinski's cabin, telling him that he knows he's guilty and he won't get away with it. Barinski comes out with a revolver, yelling at James to go away because that maniac Clarence Reed did it. James asks how he even knew what he was talking about if he wasn't guilty. Barinski asks how he knew that he knew what he was talking about, and James insists that Barinski wouldn't have known that he knew that he knew what he was talking about if he weren't guilty.

Barinski fires a shot at James's feet, and James freaks out and drops his camera. Barinski ties James up and is planning to kill him. Just as Barinski is about to pull the trigger, the police pull up outside. James tells Barinski that assault isn't as serious as murder, even one as bad as this, and he can still get out of this, but Barinski instead shoots himself.

It turns out that Lucy called the police. After the police make their father come get him, with Lucy riding along, Lucy tells him that she was the one who conviced the dentist to rat out Barinski by giving the cute act and saying it was all just for a school report for her benefit to make it really cool. When he wasn't back by late that night, she started to get worried and called the police, who found Barinski's house.

James doesn't come out of his room for several days (he spends some time writing up the story for his blog). Lucy comes by to see him and breaks her way in by giving a little sister order that he open the door. James admits that he was pretty shaken by seeing a man shoot himself in the head right in front of him and he's also disappointed because even though he's pretty sure it was Barinski, there will always be that little nagging doubt. Lucy then says that she understands, but the important thing is that the victim is alive, and he won't hurt anyone again, and that's the most important thing. Except that, she adds, James himself is also alive, even though he could have died; she bashfully admits that that's the part that's most important to her. James thinks that there's no way his little sister is this cute (if it turns out the storyline predates Ore Imo, I'll have him say
that he was the first to say it and they stole it).

James says he wouldn't have made it without her and says she's smarter than him, kinder than him, that she made all the important breakthroughs in the case and that the time he spent with her was like an oasis of the mind amidst all that gloom. However, they have to break up. Lucy asks why, even though they like being together and people say they're a cute couple, and James says it's because they're brother and sister. He says he's starting to like her as more than a sister, and that can't happen, because those feelings are creepy and disgusting.

Lucy is very hurt by thisâ€”more the delivery than the content, since she knows it can't go onâ€”and decides the best thing is to go away for a while. She went off to something or other academy of the arts to heal. The phone-time quota was actually a negotiation over what to do about their feelings; Lucy thinks the best thing is to stay apart, but James is afraid that will just make things worse and thinks they need to spend time together as brother and sister to break the spell. Of course, they can't tell their parents about this.

Sophia doesn't believe that Lucy is such a disturbed girl and is sure that James made it all up.

[Summary: James actually tracked down the murderer and was almost murdered himself; he tried to turn the guy in, but the attacker resisted and ended up shooting himself right in front of James. Throughout this event, James relies on Lucy and starts to see how brilliant, strong, and fun she is; he starts to find her advice invaluable (he flails around a lot here, more like Stark than Sherlock, and Lucy keeps him on the right track) and to find their dates a sort of mental oasis from the terror he goes through as he tangles with a serial killer.]

In the end, after the attacker shoots himself, Lucy comforts James by
reminding him that even if the attacker evaded justice, his victim is
alive and he's dead, and that's the most important thing. Except that,
she adds, James himself is also alive, even though he could have died;
she bashfully admits that that's the part that's most important to
her. James thinks that there's no way his little sister is this cute
(if it turns out the storyline predates Ore Imo, I'll have him say
that he was the first to say it and they stole it).

When he was 18 he was planning to force Lucy to break it off since an eighteen-year-old and a fourteen-year-old are weird anyway, let alone when they're blood siblings. After this event James realizes he's actually developing feelings for her since she's so cute and fun and smart, and he knows that's the worst, so he forces her to break up. Lucy was heartbroken and asked why, since they're so good together and people even say they're a cute couple; James tells her it's because they're siblings and it's creepy and disgusting. Lucy is very hurt by his way of saying this and decides to go far away for high school to give herself time to heal. But James keeps joking around with her like he does and she hates it because he keeps tempting her and also it's like he's mocking her younger self.

James tells all this to Sophia when she asks how he developed such a weird relationship with Lucy. Sophia doesn't really believe it. In recompense, though, James gets to hear a story from her past, and so the next short story is one of those. (Written from Sophia's point of view.)

** Sophia's story [untitled just yet]

In college during the 70s, Sophia was interested in this guy (she's interested in people, although even she can't say how much is her lingering
humanity and how much is her succubus instincts). The guy started to
get involved with a cult (like some kind of LSD cult). It was a
Manson-like cult where the leader collected abused young girls and
brainwashed them, having sex with all of them and using them as bait
to lure in guys (like the one Sophia's into). But Sophia doesn't know
this at first; she joins because the guy convinces her it's great,
and she wants to try being more human, so she does it. But then she
discovers the casual sex part, and obviously she can't. She also
doesn't want to take LSD because she's afraid it might cause her
succubus appearance to manifest, and she doesn't want that to happen
even if everyone else is baked.

Sophia isn't one of the inner circle, but she talks to the girls who
are, since they think she's pretty and want to convince her to give
herself to the leader. She comes in one night and hears them talking
about a special assignment they did for the leader. God told him that
for them to bring Heaven to Earth by ridding it of all Jews and
blacks (by triggering the race war), they had to start by killing
several promininent members of all three communities involved: the
Jewish community, the black community, and the WASP community. Last
night, they killed a Jewish couple living in the area as they walked
home from a show, stabbing them both to death with ice picks. They're
bragging about how stabbed the guy in the legs so he couldn't escape,
then raped his wife with a big black dildo on a broomstick and made
her squeal like a pig, then choked the woman to death on the dildo
and finished stabbing the man with the ice pick, all while on drugs.

Sophia tries to tell them that God doesn't want this and Jacob (the
cult leader) must have misinterpreted his instructions. The girls
tell her she won't really understand until she gives herself to Jacob
as they have, so that night, during the usual nightly drug party,
Sophia gives herself to Jacob in front of everyone. Jacob dies and
shrivels up like everyone who has sex with Sophia does, and Sophia
tells them she does see now: this is the judgment of God, that Jacob
was wrong and they should follow her now. Sophia orders them to turn
themselves in, saying the will of God is that they should go to
prison and spread the doctrine from behind bars, so that they might
lead the prisoners who are oppressed by society in a great revolt. 

The girls go to prison and Sophia and the guy together cut the
Goldwater sticker off his car (James calls bullshit on this, saying he's read Hearts in Atlantis). Sophia says she later had to deal with the fruits of what she did there, but that's a story for another day.
